5|$|Acupuncture: <b>Acupuncture,</b> the {{traditional}} Chinese medicinal practice of inserting needles into specific {{points of the}} body for therapeutic purposes and relieving pain, was first mentioned in the Huangdi Neijing compiled from the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC (Warring States period to Han Dynasty). The oldest known <b>acupuncture</b> sticks made of gold, found in the tomb of Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC), date to the Western Han (203 BC– 9 AD); the oldest known stone-carved depiction of <b>acupuncture</b> was made during the Eastern Han (25–220 AD); the oldest known bronze statue of an <b>acupuncture</b> mannequin dates to 1027 during the Song Dynasty (960–1279).|$|E
5|$|Historical {{sources say}} that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and <b>acupuncture.</b> The first {{mentioning}} of <b>acupuncture</b> in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing. <b>Acupuncture</b> needles made of gold {{were found in the}} tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of <b>acupuncture</b> date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and qigong are derived from Han-era calisthenics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Acupuncture</b> is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham <b>acupuncture</b> for nonspecific acute pain or {{sub-chronic}} pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain benefit is only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. <b>Acupuncture</b> may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E
5|$|After abandoning Kriya yoga, Salinger tried Dianetics (the {{forerunner of}} Scientology), even meeting its founder L. Ron Hubbard, but {{according}} to Claire he was quickly disenchanted with it. This was followed by an adherence {{to a number of}} spiritual, medical, and nutritional belief systems including an interest in Christian Science, Edgar Cayce, homeopathy, <b>acupuncture,</b> and macrobiotics.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Salzgeber {{announced}} {{that she would be}} moving her base of training from the stables in Bad Worishofen where she had been located since she graduated from college. The new facilities, nearby in Blonhofen, Bavaria, offered more room and extensive natural therapy facilities, including aquatherapy, <b>acupuncture,</b> osteopathy, and homeopathics. Salzgeber said the new, larger, base would allow her to give more training clinics and accept more students.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of <b>acupuncture,</b> herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} quality of most studies of {{complementary}} and alternative medicine {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain, {{it is not possible to}} recommend integration of these therapies into the management of cancer pain. There is weak evidence for a modest benefit from hypnosis; studies of massage therapy produced mixed results and none found pain relief after 4 weeks; Reiki, and touch therapy results were inconclusive; <b>acupuncture,</b> the most studied such treatment, has demonstrated no benefit as an adjunct analgesic in cancer pain; the evidence for music therapy is equivocal; and some herbal interventions such as PC-SPES, mistletoe, and saw palmetto are known to be toxic to some people with cancer. The most promising evidence, though still weak, is for mind-body interventions such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques.|$|E
5|$|Over 50% {{of people}} with MS may use {{complementary}} and alternative medicine, although percentages vary depending on how alternative medicine is defined. The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, <b>acupuncture,</b> and mindfulness. Regarding the characteristics of users, they are more frequently women, have had MS for a longer time, {{tend to be more}} disabled and have lower levels of satisfaction with conventional healthcare.|$|E
5|$|Plagued by hearing problems, the 64-year-old coach {{announced}} his retirement {{before the end of}} the 1970 season, which the Browns finished with a 7–7 record. Collier told Modell that he could no longer hear his players, and it was difficult to read their lips through new face masks that obscured their mouths. Modell tried to help by getting Collier to try new hearing aids and even sent him for <b>acupuncture</b> treatment, but none of it worked. Collier struggled during press conferences because he often could not hear what reporters were asking and answered the wrong questions. In eight years as coach, Collier led Cleveland to a championship and a 76–34–2 record. Nick Skorich, who came to the Browns as offensive coordinator in 1964, was named as his replacement in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that <b>acupuncture</b> and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including <b>acupuncture,</b> reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, {{at the age}} of 18, Chen began {{attending}} school as a grade one student at the Elementary School for the Blind in Linyi city. In 1994, he enrolled at the Qingdao High School for the Blind, where he studied until 1998. He had already begun developing an interest in law, and would often ask his brothers to read legal texts to him. He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor, they had to borrow $340 to cover tuition costs. They still fell short of the required $400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll. He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001, specializing in <b>acupuncture</b> and massage—the only programs available to the blind. Chen also audited legal courses, gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance. After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County.|$|E
5|$|The oldest extant Japanese lexica date to {{the early}} Heian period. Based on the Chinese Yupian, the Tenrei Banshō Meigi was {{compiled}} around 830 by Kūkai and is the oldest extant character dictionary made in Japan. The Hifuryaku is a massive Chinese dictionary in 1000 fascicles listing the usage of words and characters in more than 1500 texts of diverse genres. Compiled in 831 by Shigeno Sadanushi and others, it is the oldest extant Japanese proto-encyclopedia. There are two National Treasures of the Ishinpō, the oldest extant medical treatise of Japanese authorship compiled in 984 by Tanba Yasuyori. It {{is based on a}} large number of Chinese medical and pharmaceutical texts and contains knowledge about drug prescription, herbal lore, hygiene, <b>acupuncture,</b> moxibustion, alchemy and magic. The two associated treasures consist of the oldest extant (partial) and the oldest extant complete manuscript respectively.|$|E
25|$|Hand <b>acupuncture,</b> {{developed}} in Korea, centers around assumed reflex zones of the hand. Medical <b>acupuncture</b> attempts to integrate reflexological concepts, the trigger point model, and anatomical insights (such as dermatome distribution) into <b>acupuncture</b> practice, and emphasizes a more formulaic approach to <b>acupuncture</b> point location.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} 2016 Cochrane reviews {{found that}} <b>acupuncture</b> {{could be useful}} in the prophylaxis of tension-type headaches and episodic migraines. The 2016 Cochrane review evaluating <b>acupuncture</b> for episodic migraine prevention concluded that true <b>acupuncture</b> had a small effect beyond sham <b>acupuncture</b> and found moderate-quality {{evidence to suggest that}} <b>acupuncture</b> is at least similarly effective to prophylactic medications for this purpose. A 2012 review found that <b>acupuncture</b> has demonstrated benefit for the treatment of headaches, but that safety needed to be more fully documented in order to make any strong recommendations in support of its use.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{principles}} of evidence-based medicine to research <b>acupuncture</b> is controversial, and has produced different results. Some research suggests <b>acupuncture</b> can alleviate pain {{but the majority of}} research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo. Evidence suggests that any benefits of <b>acupuncture</b> are short-lasting. There is insufficient evidence to support use of <b>acupuncture</b> compared to mainstream medical treatments. <b>Acupuncture</b> is not better than mainstream treatment in the long term.|$|E
25|$|New {{practices}} were {{adopted in the}} 20th century, such as using a cluster of needles, electrified needles, or leaving needles inserted {{for up to a}} week. A lot of emphasis developed on using <b>acupuncture</b> on the ear. <b>Acupuncture</b> research organizations were founded in the 1950s and <b>acupuncture</b> services became available in modern hospitals. China, where <b>acupuncture</b> was believed to have originated, was increasingly influenced by Western medicine. Meanwhile, <b>acupuncture</b> grew in popularity in the US. The US Congress created the Office of Alternative Medicine in 1992 and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) declared support for <b>acupuncture</b> for some conditions in November 1997. In 1999, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine was created within the NIH. <b>Acupuncture</b> became the most popular alternative medicine in the US.|$|E
25|$|Cosmetic <b>acupuncture</b> {{is the use}} of <b>acupuncture</b> in {{an attempt}} to reduce {{wrinkles}} on the face.|$|E
25|$|A 2013 {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} <b>acupuncture</b> for chronic {{low back pain}} was cost-effective as a complement to standard care, but not {{as a substitute for}} standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented. The same meta-analysis found {{there was no difference between}} sham and non-sham <b>acupuncture.</b> A 2011 systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of <b>acupuncture</b> in the treatment of chronic low back pain. A 2010 systematic review found that the cost-effectiveness of <b>acupuncture</b> could not be concluded. A 2012 review found that <b>acupuncture</b> seems to be cost-effective for some pain conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acupuncture</b> {{became more}} {{established}} in China as improvements in paper {{led to the}} publication of more <b>acupuncture</b> books. The Imperial Medical Service and the Imperial Medical College, which both supported <b>acupuncture,</b> became more established and created medical colleges in every province. The public was also exposed to stories about royal figures being cured of their diseases by prominent acupuncturists. By time The Great Compendium of <b>Acupuncture</b> and Moxibustion was published during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644AD), most of the <b>acupuncture</b> practices used {{in the modern era}} had been established.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acupuncture</b> {{is popular}} in China, the US, Australia, and Europe {{including}} all five Nordic countries, though less so in Finland. It is most heavily practiced in China {{and is one}} of the most common alternative medicine practices in Europe. In Switzerland, <b>acupuncture</b> has become the most frequently used alternative medicine since 2004. In the United Kingdom, a total of 4 million <b>acupuncture</b> treatments were administered in 2009. <b>Acupuncture</b> is used in most pain clinics and hospices in the UK. An estimated 1 in 10 adults in Australia used <b>acupuncture</b> in 2004. In Japan, it is estimated that 25 percent of the population will try <b>acupuncture</b> at some point, though in most cases it is not covered by public health insurance. Users of <b>acupuncture</b> in Japan are more likely to be elderly and to have a limited education. Approximately half of users surveyed indicated a likelihood to seek such remedies in the future, while 37% did not. Less than one percent of the US population reported having used <b>acupuncture</b> in the early 1990s. By the early 2010s, more than 14 million Americans reported having used <b>acupuncture</b> as part of their health care.|$|E
25|$|Traditional/lay <b>acupuncture</b> {{is not a}} {{regulated}} health profession. Osteopaths have a {{scope of}} practice for Western Medical <b>Acupuncture</b> and Related Needling Techniques. The state-owned Accident Compensation Corporation reimburses for <b>acupuncture</b> treatment by registered health care practitioners and some traditional/lay acupuncturists that belong to voluntary professional associations.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of <b>acupuncture</b> are largely inconsistent. An overview of Cochrane reviews found that <b>acupuncture</b> is not effective {{for a wide}} range of conditions. A systematic review of systematic reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain. The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with <b>acupuncture</b> does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest <b>acupuncture</b> can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the placebo effect. A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of <b>acupuncture</b> seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. A meta-analysis found that <b>acupuncture</b> for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as an adjunct to standard care, while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of <b>acupuncture</b> in the treatment of chronic low back pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusions}} of many trials and numerous systematic reviews of <b>acupuncture</b> are largely inconsistent with each other. A 2011 systematic review of systematic reviews {{found that for}} reducing pain, real <b>acupuncture</b> was no better than sham <b>acupuncture,</b> and concluded that numerous reviews have shown little convincing evidence that <b>acupuncture</b> is an effective treatment for reducing pain. The same review found that neck pain {{was one of only}} four types of pain for which a positive effect was suggested, but cautioned that the primary studies used carried a considerable risk of bias. A 2009 overview of Cochrane reviews found <b>acupuncture</b> is not effective {{for a wide range of}} conditions.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{overview}} of systematic reviews found insufficient {{evidence to suggest}} that <b>acupuncture</b> is effective for surgical or post-operative pain. For the use of <b>acupuncture</b> for post-operative pain, there was contradictory evidence. A 2014 systematic review found supportive but limited evidence for use of <b>acupuncture</b> for acute post-operative pain after back surgery. A 2014 systematic review found that while the evidence suggested <b>acupuncture</b> could be an effective treatment for postoperative gastroparesis, a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality.|$|E
25|$|Many acupuncturists {{attribute}} {{pain relief}} {{to the release of}} endorphins when needles penetrate, but no longer support the idea that <b>acupuncture</b> can affect a disease. It is a generally held belief within the <b>acupuncture</b> community that <b>acupuncture</b> points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals, but no research has established any consistent anatomical structure or function for either <b>acupuncture</b> points or meridians. Human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acupuncture</b> is {{generally}} safe when administered by an experienced, appropriately trained practitioner using clean-needle technique and sterile single-use needles. When improperly delivered {{it can cause}} adverse effects. Accidents and infections are associated with infractions of sterile technique or neglect {{on the part of}} the practitioner. To reduce the risk of serious adverse events after <b>acupuncture,</b> acupuncturists should be trained sufficiently. People with serious spinal disease, such as cancer or infection, are not good candidates for <b>acupuncture.</b> Contraindications to <b>acupuncture</b> (conditions that should not be treated with <b>acupuncture)</b> include coagulopathy disorders (e.g. hemophilia and advanced liver disease), warfarin use, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis), and skin infections or skin trauma (e.g. burns). Further, electroacupuncture should be avoided at the spot of implanted electrical devices (such as pacemakers).|$|E
25|$|<b>Acupuncture,</b> {{along with}} moxibustion, {{is one of}} the oldest {{practices}} of traditional Chinese medicine. Most historians believe the practice began in China, though there are some conflicting narratives on when it originated. Academics David Ramey and Paul Buell said the exact date <b>acupuncture</b> was founded depends on the extent dating of ancient texts can be trusted and the interpretation of what constitutes <b>acupuncture.</b>|$|E

25|$|The use of <b>acupuncture</b> in Germany {{increased}} by 20% in 2007, after the German <b>acupuncture</b> trials supported its efficacy for certain uses. In 2011, {{there were more}} than one million users, and insurance companies have estimated that two-thirds of German users are women. As a result of the trials, German public health insurers began to cover <b>acupuncture</b> for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis of the knee, but not tension headache or migraine. This decision was based in part on socio-political reasons. Some insurers in Germany chose to stop reimbursement of <b>acupuncture</b> because of the trials. For other conditions, insurers in Germany were not convinced that <b>acupuncture</b> had adequate benefits over usual care or sham treatments. Highlighting the results of the placebo group, researchers refused to accept a placebo therapy as efficient.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>acupuncture</b> is not {{contraindicated}} in pregnant women, {{some specific}} <b>acupuncture</b> points are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, {{as well as}} the abdominal region, should be avoided during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In China, the {{practice}} of <b>acupuncture</b> is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board. Canada has <b>acupuncture</b> licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and <b>Acupuncture</b> Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation. Regulation in the US began in the 1970s in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho. Licensing requirements vary greatly from state to state. The needles used in <b>acupuncture</b> are regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration. In some states <b>acupuncture</b> is regulated by a board of medical examiners, while in others {{by the board of}} licensing, health or education.|$|E
25|$|In the 1st century AD, many of {{the first}} books about <b>acupuncture</b> were {{published}} and recognized acupuncturist experts began to emerge. The Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing, {{which was published in}} the mid-3rd century, became the oldest <b>acupuncture</b> book that is still in existence in the modern era. Other books like the Yu Kuei Chen Ching, written by the Director of Medical Services for China, were also influential during this period, but were not preserved. In the mid 7th century, Sun Simiao published acupuncture-related diagrams and charts that established standardized methods for finding <b>acupuncture</b> sites on people of different sizes and categorized <b>acupuncture</b> sites in a set of modules.|$|E
25|$|According to historians Lu Gwei-djen and Joseph Needham, {{there is}} {{substantial}} evidence that <b>acupuncture</b> may have begun around 600BC. Some hieroglyphs and pictographs from that era suggests <b>acupuncture</b> and moxibustion were practiced. However, historians Gwei-djen and Needham said it was unlikely a needle could be made out of the materials available in China during this time period. It is possible Bronze was used for early <b>acupuncture</b> needles. Tin, copper, gold and silver are also possibilities, though they are considered less likely, or to {{have been used in}} fewer cases. If <b>acupuncture</b> was practiced during the Shang dynasty (1766 to 1122BC), organic materials like thorns, sharpened bones, or bamboo may have been used. Once methods for producing steel were discovered, it would replace all other materials, since it could be used to create a very fine, but sturdy needles. Gwei-djen and Needham noted that all the ancient materials that could have been used for <b>acupuncture</b> and which often produce archeological evidence, such as sharpened bones, bamboo or stones, were also used for other purposes. An article in Rheumatology said that the absence of any mention of <b>acupuncture</b> in documents found in the tomb of Ma-Wang-Dui from 198BC suggest that <b>acupuncture</b> was not practiced by that time.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Tai Chi improves the range of motion of a joint in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. The evidence for <b>acupuncture</b> is inconclusive with it appearing to be equivalent to sham <b>acupuncture.</b>|$|E
