25|$|Although a few recent {{depictions of}} Zoroaster show the prophet {{performing}} some deed of legend, {{in general the}} portrayals merely present him in white vestments (which are also worn by present-day Zoroastrian priests). He often is seen holding a baresman (Avestan; Middle Persian barsom), which is {{generally considered to be}} another symbol of priesthood, or with a book in hand, which may be interpreted to be the Avesta. Alternatively, he appears with a mace, the varza—usually stylized as a steel rod crowned by a bull's head—that priests carry in their installation ceremony. In other depictions he appears with a raised hand and thoughtfully lifted finger, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a point.|$|E
25|$|Warwickshire's bowling, which lacked {{an injured}} Heath Streak, also suffered, and despite {{excellent}} figures of six for 92 from Alex Loudon the Nottinghamshire batsmen ran {{away with it}} as Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian and Australian David Hussey all made fifties. Then, it was a Nottinghamshire spinner's turn to take centre stage - Graeme Swann. In 23 overs, he took six for 57, including the entire Warwickshire middle order from three to six - only Westwood passed 25, and Warwickshire could only muster 133. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the humiliation complete, Swann was promoted to number 1, and hit one boundary and four additional runs before stumps were drawn after one over. Nottinghamshire were eight for no loss overnight, chasing 12 to win, and Darren Bicknell hit the winning runs off Dewald Pretorius four balls into the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|Having said that, {{he moves}} the log a little forward and throws a coin into the fire. The {{woman of the}} house puts a woolen blanket on the polazniks back, and seats him on a low stool by the fireplace. In {{the moment when he}} sits down, they try to pull away the stool beneath him, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him fall on the floor. The polaznik goes out into the yard, and throws grain inside a circle made with the rope with which Christmas straw has been tied, calling chickens. When they gather in the circle he catches a rooster, whose head is then cut off by him or the head of {{household}} on the house's threshold. The rooster will be roasted on a wooden spit as part of Christmas dinner. The polaznik usually stays for dinner with the family. He receives a gift {{in the form of a}} round cake with an embedded coin, and a towel, shirt, socks, or some other useful thing.|$|E

6000|$|The Knight of Martindale, who had again {{turned his}} head towards the little man, and had listened, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{something}} out of his discourse, here interrupted him with a peevish, [...] "Pshaw!" ...|$|R

2500|$|By then, {{the affair}} had {{polarized}} French society. George Sand {{wrote to her}} friend Eugène Delacroix criticizing the perceived railroading of the case (it was worth noting that Marie, in turn, was an admirer of Sand and was said to read her works [...] "greedily"). Raspail, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for his failure {{to make a difference}} in the trial, wrote and published incendiary leaflets against Orfila while demanding for Marie's release. In effect, many have felt that Marie was a victim of injustice, convicted by scientific evidence of uncertain validity.|$|E
2500|$|At the Old Trafford Roses Match in 1926, {{a record}} 78,617 spectators paid {{to watch the}} match peter out into a high scoring draw, with centuries from Lancashire's Harry Makepeace (126), Ernest Tyldesley (139) and 92 from Frank Watson being {{answered}} by Yorkshire legends Percy Holmes (143) and Herbert Sutcliffe (89) who put on 199 <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends for events 2 years previously. Leonard Green, Lancashire's captain, was batting when the score stood at 499. Neville Cardus relates the story that Green said to himself [...] "It's not likely that Lancashire ever again will score 500 against Yorkshire, so I'm {{going to get this}} single run if it kills me." [...] He pushed a ball from Wilfred Rhodes to the off-side and ran 'like the wind'. The ball was hurled back in anger by Yorkshire legend Emmott Robinson, striking Rhodes on the wrist while Green dived to make his ground. Picking himself up he heard Rhodes muttering to himself:"There's somebody runnin' up and down this wicket. Ah don't know who it is, but there's some-body runnin' up and down this wicket." [...] The operative words in that famous lamentation are, [...] "Ah don't know who it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The letters {{accompanying}} the anthrax read like {{the work of}} a jihadist, suggesting that their author was an Arab extremist—or someone masquerading as one—yet also advised recipients to take antibiotics, implying that whoever had mailed them never really intended to harm anyone." [...] Experts have suggested that the anthrax mailings included a number of indications that the mailer was trying to avoid harming anyone with his warning letters. Examples: (1) None of the intended recipients of the letters were infected. (2) The seams {{on the backs of the}} envelopes were taped over <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> certain the powders couldn't escape through open seams. (3) The letters were folded with the [...] "pharmaceutical fold", which was used for centuries to safely contain and transport doses of powdered medicines (and currently to safely hold trace evidence). (4) The media letters provided [...] "medical advice": [...] "TAKE PENACILIN NOW." [...] (5) The senate letters informed the recipient that the powder was anthrax: [...] "WE HAVE THIS ANTHRAX." [...] And, (6) at the time of the mailings, it was generally believed that such powders could not escape from a sealed envelope – except through the two open corners where a letter opener is inserted, and those corners had been taped shut.|$|E

60|$|While I was {{speaking}} the cur looked me {{full in the}} face, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> out who I was; but I believe he feigned ignorance only {{that he might have}} time in which to decide upon a course of action.|$|R
6000|$|The boy lay <b>as</b> <b>if</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{out what}} had happened, and the doctor {{told him that he}} had fainted. After a time, he put out his hand and laid it on Bartley's head. [...] "Yes; but I don't {{understand}} what makes him cry." ...|$|R
