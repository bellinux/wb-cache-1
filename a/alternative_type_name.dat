40|$|Analysis of {{literature}} shows that “modern roundabouts” nowadays exist in all European countries, {{as well as}} in more than 60 countries elsewhere in the world. Nowadays, a growing number of studies, presented in scientific and professional literature, point out a poor traffic safety characteristics of “standard” two-lane roundabouts and lower capacity then was expected. These problems are resolved in more ways in different countries; however the solution, whereby the number of conflict spots is diminished has proven to be the most successful. Lower number of conflict spots is one of characteristics of the <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of roundabouts. The <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of roundabouts are usually more recent and implemented only in certain countries. It is typical for them that they differ from “standard” one- and two-lane roundabouts in one or more design elements, while the purpose of their implementation is also specific. This paper illustrate four relative new <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of roundabouts - “turbo”, “flower”, “target” and “four flyover” roundabouts and their comparison from designing, capacity and traffic - safety point of view...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{monetary}} and fiscal policy making in a monetary union when authorities face asymmetries {{in the countries}} constructing this monetary union. We analyze this problem in an asymmetric environment using a two-country theoretical model and by introducing two <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of national asymmetries : asymmetric shocks and the asymmetric transmission mechanism. The central issue of {{the paper is the}} design of the appropriate monetary and fiscal policy institutions. In this respect, we investigate which of the two <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of monetary policymakers (country representatives or governors) facing to two <b>alternative</b> <b>types</b> of fiscal policy (decentralized or centralized) contributes to better resolve the problem of the trade-off between credibility and flexibility. Our results show that delegate the monetary policy to a council of union-wide governors with decentralized fiscal policies is the appropriate institutional design that would reduce the iinflation bias and stabilize better the regional idiosyncratic shocks in a monetary union in the cases of perfectly asymmetric and perfectly symmetric shocks. In addition, in the case of asymmetric transmission, the monetary union would be better off with a council of monetary policy governors and centralized fiscal policies.

500|$|The above line of code {{tells the}} {{compiler}} to use System {{as a candidate}} prefix for types used in the source code. In this case, when the compiler sees use of the Console type later in the source code, it tries to find a <b>type</b> <b>named</b> Console, first in the current assembly, followed by all referenced assemblies. In this case the compiler fails to find such a <b>type,</b> since the <b>name</b> of the <b>type</b> is actually System.Console. The compiler then attempts to find a <b>type</b> <b>named</b> System.Console by using the System prefix from the [...] statement, {{and this time it}} succeeds. The [...] statement allows the programmer to state all candidate prefixes to use during compilation instead of always using full <b>type</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R
