2500|$|The critics had a {{field day}} with his gimmicky act, his showy but careful piano playing, his {{non-stop}} promotions, and his gaudy display of success, but he remained largely unaffected, as preserved by the famous quotation, first recorded in a letter to a critic, [...] "Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it, in fact, my brother George <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{all the way to the}} bank." [...] He used a similar response to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to [...] "I cried all the way to the bank." [...] In an appearance on The Tonight Show some years later, Liberace reran the anecdote to Johnny Carson, and finished it by saying, [...] "I don't cry all the way to the bank any more – I [...] the bank!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then I leant {{back and}} burst into a shout of laughter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> till my sides ached, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> again.|$|E
60|$|I saw him bite his lip and frown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> to myself. Lady St. Maurice was hesitating.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's those books. Sometimes I {{think it}} is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> {{at the whole}} idea; and then again it's so strong that I can't get away from it. Ellen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] replied Elizabeth--"there {{are such}} people, but I hope I am {{not one of}} them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, <b>I</b> own, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> at them {{whenever}} I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> Rosinante! <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{softly to}} think of her staid bones beside the phantom {{creature}} this prince had called up to me at mention of [...] "Twilight." ...|$|R
60|$|Esther <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> at the grandiloquent {{manner in}} which {{he spoke of the}} two potato-sacksful of books.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{and looked}} at me over his cigarette, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|E
60|$|Cousin Edie {{laughed at}} all this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> because she did; but I {{was not so}} sure that it was funny.|$|E
50|$|He also {{recorded}} four audio albums: Live at the Melkweg (Milky Way Records LP 1978), Clown Power (Ariola LP 1980), Live in Europe (Polydor LP 1980), Holey Moley (Silenz CD 1991) and two books: Jango Edwards (written in English {{but with a}} cover in German) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Laugh</b> You (Rostrum Haarlem, 1984). The Clown Power album was a limited edition of 3000 copies, each with a different album cover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] said Madame Flicflac, <b>and</b> laughed; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> Jemmy <b>laughed</b> out of politeness: and {{a pretty}} {{laughing}} matter it was, as you shall hear.|$|R
60|$|It {{was my turn}} to flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> with her.|$|R
60|$|But a {{crowd of}} ragged onlookers had already {{gathered}} around the cab, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> again {{and walked back to}} the old-clothes shop.|$|E
6000|$|... "The artist's?" [...] I repeated. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed,</b> frantically, wildly, gloomily, incoherently, disagreeably. I am {{sensible}} that I did. I know I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "The deuce you have, Mr. Carvel!" [...] said he, and laughed. And Comyn laughed, and Dorothy laughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed.</b> We {{were friends}} from that moment.|$|E
5000|$|Jamais je ne pleure et jamais je ne ris (<b>I</b> never cry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>laugh),</b> oil on canvas, c. 1972, Royal Academy of Arts, London ...|$|R
60|$|My face fairly tingled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard Nick <b>laughing</b> with unseemly merriment.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> my defiance; for now, {{and for the}} moment, I {{know the}} White Logic to be the arch-impostor of them all, {{whispering}} his whispers of death. And he is guilty of his own unmasking, with his own genial chemistry turning the tables on himself, with his own maggots biting alive the old illusions, resurrecting and making to sound again the old voice from beyond of my youth, telling me again that still are mine the possibilities and powers which life and the books had taught me did not exist.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pity I hadn't brought mine--I do so {{well with}} it,' I said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> as I remembered how I aimed at Joe and hurt myself.|$|E
6000|$|Wali Dad laughed immoderately, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> too. 'Be it so,' said he. 'My friend, are {{you willing}} to take this lucrative Government appointment? Lalun, what shall his pay be?' ...|$|E
60|$|Mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{and shivered}} over Uncle Jesse's tales, {{and once we}} found {{ourselves}} crying. Uncle Jesse surveyed our tears with pleasure shining out through his face like an illuminating lamp.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>laughing.</b> [...] "Yet {{why should}} they not do so, as they live at all? If so, perhaps I am that Wanderer, in whose body I seemed to be, only then I am sure that the lady with the golden shells was not Iduna." [...] <b>And</b> again <b>I</b> <b>laughed.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know why}} Hareton never speaks, when I {{am in the}} kitchen,' she exclaimed, on another occasion. 'He is afraid <b>I</b> shall <b>laugh</b> at him. Ellen, what do you think? He began to teach himself to read once; <b>and,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>laughed,</b> he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a fool?' ...|$|R
60|$|Gril. Why, to hang you {{upon the}} highest branches. 'Fore God, {{it will be}} so; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>laugh</b> To see you {{dangling}} to and fro i'the air, With the honest crows pecking your traitors' limbs.|$|R
6000|$|Wali Dad laughed immoderately, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> too. [...] "Be it so," [...] said he. [...] "My friend, are {{you willing}} to take this lucrative Government appointment? Lalun, what shall his pay be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, sir," [...] Macomber {{replied in}} a tone of content, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{inwardly}} with joy, for he would be our prisoner to a certainty if he came down the river alone.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked about}} {{me at the}} room, the goggling Rowley, the {{extinguished}} fire; my mind reviewed the laughable incidents {{of the day and}} night; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> out loud to myself--lonely and cheerless laughter!...|$|E
60|$|I followed, {{expecting to}} see Eustace; but the rider was instead Dermot Tracy, who in unfeigned alarm asked if he were seriously ill; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>and</b> explained, he gave his horse, to the groom, and came quietly enough, to satisfy Dora, into the hall with us.|$|R
6000|$|That orbed maiden {{with white}} fire laden, [...] 45 Whom mortals call the Moon, Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor, By the midnight breezes strewn; And {{wherever}} {{the beat of}} her unseen feet, Which only the angels hear, [...] 50 May have broken the woof of my tent's thin roof. The stars peep behind her <b>and</b> peer; <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>laugh</b> to see them whirl and flee, Like a swarm of golden bees. When I widen the rent in my wind-built tent, [...] 55 Till the calm rivers, lakes, and seas, Like strips of the sky fallen through me on high, Are each paved with the moon and these.|$|R
60|$|So {{they left}} me alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{was not sure}} whether the honours {{remained}} with him or with me. He had never for a moment lost his dignity, nor had he even looked ridiculous when calmly rearranging his tie <b>and</b> collar. <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> to myself bitterly as I prepared to follow them. I was determined to lay the whole matter before the Duke at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have chosen}} long ago. Leo, we began this journey {{together}} and we will end it together. Perhaps Ayesha knows and will help us," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> drearily. [...] "If not--come, we are wasting time." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I {{thought of}} a joke (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> till I cried) [...] Of an idle young woman who tarried [...] About a church-door {{for a look at}} the bride, [...] Although 'twas herself that was married.|$|E
60|$|The Chevalier swore through set teeth; Geneviève trembled, Andrea looked askance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> softly at the Chevalier's discomfiture. Eugène flung {{his hat and}} cloak into {{a corner}} and strode {{across the room to}} where his father stood.|$|E
50|$|Not only is Dr. Berk {{a master}} of writing an {{interesting}} case history, his ability {{to tell a story}} is strikingly rich, deep, <b>and</b> engaging. <b>I</b> <b>laughed,</b> <b>I</b> cried, <b>and</b> came away thinking this is a story that has to be told. I started reading it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> could not put it down—or I probably {{would not have been able}} to fall asleep that night without knowing how it ended for Dr. Berk but also for perpetrator.|$|R
60|$|About noon on the {{following}} day, when my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were <b>laughing</b> <b>and</b> arguing over some little domestic detail of our meagre establishment--so soon are great griefs forgotten in an overwhelming joy, of a sudden I saw her face change, and asked what was the matter.|$|R
60|$|The whole plan of {{campaign}} unrolled itself before me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> fairly <b>laughed</b> in glee, {{looking out of}} the garret window right down on the little bald spot {{on the top of}} Uncle Abimelech's head, as he stood laying down the law to Murray about something.|$|R
