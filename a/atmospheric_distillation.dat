For multicomponent mixtures with more than 3 components, compositional plot visualisation is more difficult, thus most graphical methods fail and as a result a representative three component constant volatility mixture of pentane, heptane and hexane was selected on the assumption that it would fairly mimic the paraffinic synthetic crude oil behaviour. After analysis of the three component distributed feed schemes, the ideas were then extended to a synthetic crude oil system in Aspen Plus. The results showed that there was potential to reduce equipment size, such as the condenser and furnace, plus there is a real opportunity to possibly do away with at least one or two pump-around circuits.

40|$|International audienceIn Part I of this paper, it {{was shown}} on {{thermodynamic}} grounds that introducing a flash in the preheating train of an <b>atmospheric</b> oil <b>distillation</b> process, together with an appropriate introduction of the resulting vapour into the column, could potentially bring substantial energy savings, by reducing {{the duty of the}} preheating furnace, by doing some pre-fractionation and by reducing the column irreversibilities. Part II expands on this idea by showing how this can be done while keeping the throughput and the product characteristics unchanged. The outcome is that placing several flashes after the heat exchangers and feeding the corresponding vapour streams to the appropriate trays of the column reduces the pumparound flows and the heat brought to the preheating train. The resulting heat deficit may then be compensated in an additional heat exchanger by using low level heat recuperated from the products of the distillation and/or imported from other processes. The use of this residual heat reduces the furnace duty by approximately an equivalent amount. Thus high level energy (fuel-gas burnt in the furnace) is replaced by residual low level heat. The simulation with an example flowsheet shows that the savings on fuel could be as high as 21 %...|$|R

50|$|Prior to World War II in {{the early}} 1940s, most {{petroleum}} refineries in the United States consisted simply of crude oil distillation units (often referred to as <b>atmospheric</b> crude oil <b>distillation</b> units). Some refineries also had vacuum distillation units as well as thermal cracking units such as visbreakers (viscosity breakers, units to lower the viscosity of the oil). All of the many other refining processes discussed below were developed during the war or {{within a few years}} after the war. They became commercially available within 5 to 10 years after the war ended and the worldwide petroleum industry experienced very rapid growth. The driving force for that growth in technology and in the number and size of refineries worldwide was the growing demand for automotive gasoline and aircraft fuel.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} area in process integration {{is the development}} of methodologies to minimize water and energy use in industry. More than 20 % of the energy consumption in industry is associated with cooling and heating water.

These procedures are advantageous compared with other methodologies since hand calculation is used, a very useful feature for process engineers.

40|$|Multicomponent {{distillation}} is a workhorse {{of current}} chemical engineering, {{used on a}} large scale in the petrochemicals, petroleum and bulk chemicals sectors. Due to its widespread use, any performance improvements developed have a substantial real-life impact. In this work, we focus on reducing the heat duty requirement for multicomponent distillation through finding good configurations of distillation columns. We first explore the search space of distillation column configurations, and classify the search space into categories. We find that some categories have many more configurations than other categories, and grow much more rapidly with the number of feed components. We ask whether there are any categories that will always dominate other categories in our chosen performance measure of low heat duty requirement. We find through extensive computational experiments that indeed the hypothesis is verified, and that the so-called non-sharp configurations almost always require less heat duty than sharp-split configurations. Further, we find that configurations that use n– 1 columns for an n-component feed (the socalled basic configurations) require less heat duty than configurations that have more columns (the so-called non-basic configurations), which would imply that basic configurations dominate non-basic configurations in both reduced heat duty and lower capital cost. Subsequently, we formalize the results into a mathematical framework to generate all basic configurations, and nothing but basic configurations, which we call the supernetwork formulation. We solve for minimum heat duty using conventional mathematical programming local search techniques, global search techniques, and stochastic methods. We find that local search over the continuous decisions that describe the parameters for each configuration is currently the most reliable and robust approach, beating out global search techniques in robustness and beating stochastic search in efficiency. Overall, we find that solving many relatively small non-linear programs is better than solving a single mixed-integer non-linear program for the problem of distillation configuration synthesis. We then explore ways to develop heuristics automatically from the results of the optimization through machine learning techniques. Finally, we use our methods to solve three case studies in the broad area of hydrocarbon separation. We find configurations and corresponding molar flow parameters for the recovery of ethylene from cracked naphtha which require 13 to 17 % less heat duty overall and up to 17 % less methane condensation duty than configurations currently used in industry. We find configurations that reduce the heat duty requirement of <b>atmospheric</b> crude <b>distillation</b> by 17 % to 20 % depending on the composition of the crude. We also demonstrate that some configurations when used for cyclopentane distillation can reduce the overall heat duty by 70 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{estimating}} {{proven reserves}} is an inexact science, most figures {{indicate that the}} depletion of fossil fuels will be evident before {{the middle of this}} century [LM 02]. Therefore there is a growing need for alternative feedstocks to insure energy resources. There are several options available including wind, solar and nuclear as well as biomass. Other than long-term supply issues the main driver for moving away from fossil fuels are environmental considerations. Since pre-industrial times the level of atmospheric CO 2 has risen from 280 ppm to 360 ppm, and whilst some observers believe this may be a natural cycle in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s history, most believe it is a direct consequence of burning fossil fuels. This additional CO 2 is now thought to be the main cause of global warming via the greenhouse effect [LM 02]. Biomass, an organic non-fossil material, can be the answer to the energy and the pollution problem. Additionally, some biomass treatments can result in the production of some speciality chemicals. Composting, direct landfilling, compression/concentration, liquid extraction and thermal treatment (incineration, gasification and pyrolysis) are possible methods for biomass treatment. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of organic materials by heating in the absence of oxygen and water and is a promising technique, which has gained interest in recent years. The disposal of sewage sludge, which is a special kind of biomass, is produced by urban and industrial wastewater treatment plants, and is a matter of great concern. Pyrolysis is currently being investigated as an alternative {{solution to the problem of}} sewage sludge disposal, because it has certain advantages over other methods. The use of pyrolysis to treat sewage sludge results in a huge volume reduction and gives rise to the production of three products, viz charcoal, oil and gas with proportions depending on the pyrolysis method, reaction parameters and feed being used. Earlier research proves that bio oil derived from the pyrolysis of sewage sludge has good commercial value as a fuel to power diesel engines. However, the properties of the oil, such as its bad odour, high viscosity and its instability can be a disadvantage for marketing the oil [DA 05]. This paper examines the possibilities of improving the characteristics of the <b>atmospheric</b> and vacuum <b>distillation</b> products from relatively old bio oil that is derived from sewage sludge. Herefore the chemical and physicochemical characteristics of the fractions will be examined. The characterization techniques applied are GC-MS, calorimetry, microscopic examination and adorption/desorption of N 2 at 77 K. The acid number and the water content (Karl Fischer-titration) of the different fractions can give additionally information. Some upgrading techniques such as esterification, hydrogenation, carbonisation and activation will be tested upon the atmospheric and/or vacuum fractions. All these tests were performed in the institute of Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum and Coal at the Chemistry Faculty of the Wroc&# 322;aw University of Technology in Poland...|$|R
50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as reflux drum which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>distillation</b> column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors.
