In this paper, the buckling of polar and rectilinearly orthotropic annuli subjected to internal or external pressure loading is examined without restriction to axisymmetric buckling modes. The buckling analyses are performed in both the polar orthotropic and rectilinearly orthotropic cases by the Rayleigh-Ritz method. In the rectilinearly orthotropic cases, the pre-buckling solution is obtained via Galerkin's method as no known exact solution exists, while in the polar orthotropic case the pre-buckling stress distributions used are exact.

The most typical cross-linked configuration was obtained {{in order to use}} in further simulations. The mechanical properties of this cross-linked structure were determined using MD simulations and the results were verified with those available in literatures. Graphene with different aspect ratios and concentrations (1 %, 3 % and 5 %) were considered in order to construct amorphous unit cells of Gr-Ep nanocomposites. The Gr-Ep nanocomposites system undergoes NVT (constant number of atoms, volume and temperature) and NPT (constant number of atoms, pressure and temperature) ensemble with applied uniform strain field during MD simulation to obtain bulk Young's modulus and shear modulus. The stress-strain response was also evaluated for both amorphous and crystalline unit cells of Gr-Ep system under uni-axial deformation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{three-dimensional}} Poisson equation solver for the electrostatic potential of a charged beam with large longitudinal to transverse aspect ratio in a straight and a bent conducting pipe with open-end boundary conditions. In this solver, {{we have used a}} Hermite-Gaussian series to represent the longitudinal spatial dependence of the charge density and the electric potential. Using the Hermite-Gaussian approximation, the original three-dimensional Poisson equation has been reduced into a group of coupled two-dimensional partial differential equations with the coupling strength proportional to the inverse square of the longitudinal-to-transverse aspect ratio. For a large aspect ratio, the coupling is weak. These two-dimensional partial differential equations can be solved independently using an iterative approach. The iterations converge quickly due to the large <b>aspect</b> <b>ration</b> of the beam. For a transverse round conducting pipe, the two-dimensional Poisson equation is solved using a Bessel function approximation and a Fourier function approximation.
