JABAWS:MSA provides services for five multiple sequence alignment (MSA) methods (Probcons, T-coffee, Muscle, Mafft and ClustalW), and is the system employed by the Jalview multiple sequence analysis workbench since version 2. 6. A fully functional, easy to set up server is provided as a Virtual Appliance (VA), which can be run on most operating systems that support a virtualization environment such as VMware or Oracle VirtualBox. JABAWS is also distributed as a Web <b>Application</b> <b>aRchive</b> (WAR) and can be configured to run on a single computer and/or a cluster managed by Grid Engine, LSF or other queuing systems that support DRMAA. JABAWS:MSA provides clients full access to each application's parameters, allows administrators to specify named parameter preset combinations and execution limits for each application through simple configuration files. The JABAWS command-line client allows integration of JABAWS services into conventional scripts...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{represents}} {{a solution to}} the problem of remote access to a server application, its management, and graphical user interface (GUI) build above console application. The TRIS Server operates in the UNIX environment without a graphical user interface as a service. Access to the <b>application,</b> <b>archive</b> files and management without graphical user interface is user unfriendly, as it requires knowledge of UNIX environment and Bash scripting language. Remote access via the internet {{represents a}}n elegant solution. The web site can be accessed by every user using personal or portable computer and even tablet computer or mobile phone. Access to internet network and web browser is required to access web site. It was the obvious solution, since accessing internet became daily routine. The thesis starts with description of TRIS, system for advanced traffic supervision and control based on application TRIS SIL 4. Focus is on server side of the application, for which we prepared a user friendly remote access interface. The thesis continues with a description of the requirements. The thesis outlines the methods for realization of the solution, the choice of technology, and the pros and cons of these. The second half of the thesis presents concepts of the implementation of a system for remote access to TRIS SIL 4 server application. ...|$|E

40|$|In a CAD/CAE {{facility}} {{there is}} always the possibility that one may want to transfer the design graphics database from the native system to a non-native system. This may occur because of dissimilar systems within an organization or a new CAD/CAE system is to be purchased. The Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) was developed in an attempt to solve this scenario. IGES is a neutral database format into which the CAD/CAE native database format can be translated to and from. Translating the native design database format to IGES requires a pre-processor and transling from IGES to the native database format requires a post-processor. IGES is an artifice to represent CAD/CAE product data in a neutral environment to allow interfacing <b>applications,</b> <b>archive</b> the database, interchange of product data between dissimilar CAD/CAE systems, and other applications. The intent here is to present test data on translating design product data from a CAD/CAE system to itself and to translate data initially prepared in IGES format to various native design formats.

30|$|We model each walker’s {{identity}} {{using the}} VQ method, {{since it has}} successful <b>applications</b> <b>archived</b> in efficient data compression [29] and voice-based speaker recognition [30]. The utility of VQ lies in the efficiency of using compact codebooks for modeling sequence pattern. In VQ based method, the codebooks have no explicit temporal order information and can come from {{any part of the}} training feature sequence. However, some indirect clues are preserved because the entries of codebook are trained to minimize average distortion through one’s training sequences. Each codeword in the codebook is corresponded with the more frequent feature slices or key-poses in the individual training data. Often a small size of codebook is enough to represent one’s identity during relatively steady walk. Compared with the well-studied time-varying signal modeling approach (such as the Hidden Markov Models, HMMs [31]), the VQ is a lightweight modeling approach and has not the ability to model complex time series. Therefore, the VQ is a weak classifier for walker recognition. Under the assumption of using the proposed sensing method as the data acquisition method, if a lightweight and weak classifier would achieve good results, then we can demonstrate the validity of the proposed sensing method indirectly.|$|R
