25|$|Owens {{made his}} unannounced main roster debut on the May 18, 2015 episode of Raw {{responding}} to John Cena's United States Championship open challenge. However, instead of {{competing in the}} match, Owens attacked Cena <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> on the United States title {{in a show of}} disrespect, setting up a non-title match between the two at Elimination Chamber on May 31, which Owens won cleanly by pinfall. A rematch between the two took place in June, at Money in the Bank, which Cena won, and after the match, Owens powerbombed Cena onto the ring apron. Owens later challenged Cena to a match for the United States Championship, which took place at Battleground, which Cena won by submission, thus ending their feud. After the loss to Cena, Owens entered a feud with Cesaro, defeating him in two matches – at SummerSlam and on an episode of Raw eight days later.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} between Sting and Butch Reed. Sting {{dominated}} Reed {{in the earlier}} part of the match.

He helped reporters {{understand}} where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn't, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting {{state and federal agencies}} and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. [...] Johnson's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: [...] "I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself to be a Republican with no interest in running for president.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer for}} Billboard noted that Gaga waded <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> {{through the desert}} while wearing tiny shorts and then appears in a party, and the ending {{signified}} the singer to be alone, [...] "rolling in the desert". Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone described the visuals as [...] "an eye-popping, strobe-lit bacchanal" [...] with Gaga [...] " [...] a frenetic desert rager in the euphoric new video". Joey Nolfi from Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review, saying that it consisted of [...] "simple production design, emphasis on Gaga's unbridled choreography, and the noticeable absence of eccentric costumes and wigs" [...] which made it a [...] "radical departure" [...] from Gaga's videography. He noticed that the video was heavy on [...] "rock star energy" [...] {{and did not have}} any particular narrative just focusing on [...] "Gaga, the music, and the moves". Chelsea Stone from Teen Vogue complimented the dance nature of the clip and noted that Gaga had posted images from the video previously, as well as wore the same outfit from the video while announcing its premiere on Twitter. Bianca Gracie from Fuse commented that Gaga [...] "exudes fearlessness while she kicks up dust, drives around in a jeep and throws a wild party" [...] in the video. Carey O'Donnell from Papermag felt that the video [...] "enhanced" [...] the song with a [...] "sort of a 'Ohhhhh this is what we're doing' moment" [...] and it pointed to an unplugged era for Gaga.|$|E

500|$|The central feud in {{the match}} between Guts & Glory and The Million Dollar Team was between Lex Luger and Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. During 1994, DiBiase had [...] "purchased" [...] the {{contracts}} of several wrestlers {{to form a}} heel stable. Among the members to join were Bam Bam Bigelow and King Kong Bundy. Prior to SummerSlam 1994, DiBiase claimed to have added Luger to the group. Luger denied having joined, despite Tatanka claiming that he had evidence that Luger had [...] "sold out" [...] to DiBiase. Luger and Tatanka faced each other at SummerSlam, where {{it was revealed that}} the storyline was a swerve, as Tatanka turned on Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Bigelow and Adam Bomb had also been feuding since the September 10, 1994 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. Bigelow attacked his opponent, a jobber, before the match. DiBiase then claimed that the company was not providing suitable competition, and he challenged any wrestler to face Bigelow. Bomb responded, and the two brawled briefly. Leading up to Survivor Series, Bomb and Bigelow faced each other at several house shows. The Heavenly Bodies were not members of DiBiase's stable, but they competed on behalf of the group. At the time, they were involved in a feud with The Smokin' Gunns {{as a result of a}} match on the September 3 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. The Heavenly Bodies attacked the Gunns prior to the match and stole the Gunns' cowboy hats. They put on the hats to mock the Gunns and then threw them on the ground <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> on them. To get revenge, the Gunns stole The Heavenly Bodies' ring robes and tore the wings off them.|$|E

2500|$|British expatriates brought {{football}} to Argentina in the 19th century.

During the quarter-final game at Wembley Stadium, the home of the England national team, Argentine captain Antonio Rattin was sent off as Argentina lost in a game which contained excessive foul play. Rattin was angered at the sending-off, feeling that the German referee had been biased towards the English, a fellow European nation, in front of their home fans, <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> over the royal carpet in the stadium. This led England manager Alf Ramsey to describe the Argentines as [...] "animals", comments that were viewed as racist by the Argentines.|$|E

But neither may Germans imagine that they might push Italy back to Salorno and from there to the Lago di Garda. Perhaps the Germans believe that all Italians are like Credaro. If they do, they’re sorely mistaken. In Italy, there are hundreds of thousands of Fascists who would rather lay waste to Alto Adige than to permit the tricolore that flies above the Vetta d’Italia to be lowered. If the Germans have to be beaten <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> to bring them to reason, then so be it, we’re ready. A lot of Italians have been trained in this business." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 7, 1853, after {{swearing}} in 150 [...] "special police constables", Mayor Alfred King led {{the police}} to the railroad bridge crossing State and French streets and, where engineers had marked {{the edges of the}} streets on the bridges, had sections of the bridges cut out. That evening, [...] away in town of Harborcreek, its citizens decided to pass its own ordinances and then proceeded to tear up tracks along the highway. Three days later, tracks of the new gauge were completed up to the city limits and that night the people of Harbor Creek tore out the tracks again, knocked down a bridge, and even ploughed up a level crossing. An injunction was obtained by the railroad from the United States Circuit Court in Pittsburgh and a United States Marshal was dispatched to Harborcreek. Upon arriving in Harborcreek, the marshal served it to one of the officials of Harborcreek and pointed out the seal of the United States. The official promptly threw it on the ground <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> it with his heel and declaring the heelmark [...] "the seal of Harborcreek." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 22, 1897, {{another meeting}} {{was held in}} Tejeros.

The Magdiwang faction allied with Bonifacio and prepared and hosted the election, as most of the Magdalo faction was occupied by battle preparations. [...] Bonifacio chaired the election and stated that the election results were to be respected. When the voting ended, Bonifacio had lost and the leadership turned over to Aguinaldo, who was away fighting in Pasong Santol. Bonifacio also lost other positions to members of his Magdiwang faction. Instead, he was elected as Director of the Interior, but his qualifications were questioned by a Magdalo, Daniel Tirona. Bonifacio felt insulted and would have shot Tirona if Artemio Ricarte had not intervened. Invoking his position of Supremo of the Katipunan, Bonifacio declared the election void <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> out in anger. Aguinaldo took his oath of office as president the next day in Santa Cruz de Malabon (present-day Tanza) in Cavite, as did the rest of the officers, except for Bonifacio.|$|E

2500|$|Polish {{communities}} in the United States were targeted by Nativist groups and sympathizers during the 1920s. In White Deer, Texas, where Poles were virtually the only ethnic minority, Polish children had near-daily fights with other schoolchildren, and southerners imitated their parents in calling them [...] "Polocks and damn Catholics". The Ku Klux Klan in particular rose in numbers and political activity during the 1920s, leading parades, protests, and violence in Polish American neighborhoods. On May 18, 1921, about 500 white-robed, torch-bearing members from Houston took a train to Brenham, Texas and marched carrying signs such as [...] "Speak English or quit talking on Brenham's streets". Physical attacks on German Americans were more common than for Poles, who were not as politically active in Brenham. Following the parade, residents would {{not come to the}} town or leave their homes to go to church, afraid of violence. To defuse the situation, a meeting at a local courthouse between Anglo, German, and Slavic leaders created laws requiring funeral services, church sermons, and business transactions to be conducted in English only for the next few months. During the time, Brenham was popularly known as the [...] "Capital of Texas Polonia" [...] because of its large Polish population. The KKK led a similar anti foreigner event in Lilly, Pennsylvania in 1924, which had a significant number of Poles. A novel based on the historical experience of Polish Americans in Lilly, Pennsylvania during this affair is The Masked Family by Robert Jeschonek. The Klan infiltrated the local police of southern Illinois during the 1920s, and search warrants were freely given to Klan groups who were deputized as prohibition officers. In one instance in 1924, S. Glenn Young and 15 Klansmen raided a Polish wedding in Pittsburg, Illinois, violently pushing everyone against the walls, drank their wine, stole their silver dollars, <b>and</b> <b>stomped</b> on the wedding cake. The Polish couple had informed Mayor Arlie Sinks and Police chief Mun Owens beforehand that they were throwing a wedding and wanted to ensure protection; they did not know that Sinks and Owens themselves were Klansmen.|$|E
