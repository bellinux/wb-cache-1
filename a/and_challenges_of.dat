25|$|The university's first {{director}} was Arthur Denning (1949–1952), who made important contributions to founding the university. In 1953, he {{was replaced by}} Philip Baxter, who continued as vice-chancellor when this position's title was changed in 1955. Baxter's dynamic, if authoritarian, management was central to the university's first 20 years. His visionary, but at times controversial, energies saw the university grow from a handful to 15,000 students by 1968. The new vice-chancellor, Rupert Myers (1969–1981), brought consolidation and an urbane management style to a period of expanding student numbers, demand for change in university style <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> student unrest.|$|E

25|$|In 1575, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Alfonso Gutierez, twenty-four Spanish Augustinians landed in the islands and, with the respective provincials Diego de Herrera and Martin de Rado, worked very successfully, at first as wandering preachers. Franciscans first appeared in the Philippines in 1577 and were welcomed by the Augustinians. Soon they were joined by Dominicans and Jesuits. Sent by Philip III, the first Discalced Augustinians landed in 1606. All these Orders shared in the work <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the missions. Protected by Spain, they prospered, and their missionary efforts became more and more successful. In 1773 the Jesuits, however, were obliged to give up their missions in consequence of the suppression of the Society.|$|E
25|$|Raj Bisaria {{was aware}} {{from the very}} {{beginning}} that any worthwhile theatre activity had to find its moorings in Hindi and other Indian languages. He sought the co-operation of the then existing theatre groups to realize his plans to establish a bilingual theatre in Lucknow. But his effort failed to elicit any response from them. He even brought the production rights of Mohan Rakesh’s well known play, Adhe-Adhure, which he could not stage for want of a suitable cast. In his bid to switch over to Hindi drama, he invited Delhi groups to produce, under TAW’s auspices, plays in Hindi with a view to making local groups conscious of the potentialities <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> Hindi Theatre.|$|E

25|$|The {{residents}} and staff together took {{responsibility for the}} daily maintenance {{of the community and}} all contributed to cooking and cleaning. The young people were considered to be partners in the therapeutic endeavour and there was an expectation that everyone attended the daily community meetings. These meetings were the heart of the community and often young people were able to share and resolve very painful experiences from their past, and the daily difficulties <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> sixty adults and children living together could be addressed in a helpful way. There were high expectations on young people to help each other and to achieve educationally. Many young people left to go to university and others took up higher education at a later point in their adult lives. Unfortunately a big fire broke out in 1990 and the building was uninsured. Residential care for children has also fallen out of favour as a result of abuse scandals and Peper Harow was sold and redeveloped into flats. It still has an influence today. In particular Rose's understanding {{of the importance of the}} physical and sensory environment in healing traumatised young people was decades ahead of his time.|$|E

500|$|When {{appointed}} as clergyman at the Free Church united parishes of Tiree and Coll by the Duke of Argyll in early 1861, objections were initially raised by {{some members of}} the Tiree congregation who found Gregorson Campbell's sermons boring, uninspiring and [...] "devoid of fervour". The Presbytery upheld two of the three main complaints, but an appeal was made to the Synod. Concerns had also been expressed that his health was insufficiently robust to serve the needs <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the Tiree parish. The appeal was heard by the General Assembly on 31 May 1861 with Gregorson Campbell's defence arguing that the main thrust of the complaints was actually founded on the congregation's desire to have their own preferred minister appointed. The motion was not upheld and Gregorson Campbell became the minister of both parishes, a position he held for thirty years.|$|E

500|$|The book uses a {{first person}} memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter. The authors {{purposely}} avoided writing a self-help book {{in favour of}} the memoir style, saying, [...] "We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and let them see it through our eyes." [...] The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> the diet into more personal relationship issues. Prior to writing the book they created a general plan on where the narrative would lead. They took turns writing so they could monitor each other's progress. As the two alternate there are shifts in perspectives, though the overall theme of [...] "traceability" [...] persisted. The general tone {{has been described as}} charming, innocent, and sometimes funny. Smith's chapters have been said to demonstrate more honesty and vulnerability, while MacKinnon's were more [...] "show pieces, little tours de force". The final chapter was authored together by Smith and MacKinnon writing as a disembodied third-person narrator to summarize and conclude the book.|$|E
500|$|MeTV {{described}} Clair's {{parenting style}} as [...] "firm, yet loving." [...] Writing for NPR, Eric Deggans observed that Clair uses a [...] "loving-yet-sardonic" [...] approach to parenting, demonstrated by her line [...] "I {{was a beautiful}} woman once, before the children came". Considered to be the stricter of the two parents, Clair is humorous and sarcastic about the frustrations <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> <b>of</b> parenting, often joking about killing or abandoning her children {{but at the same}} time making sure they do not take her exaggerated threats too seriously by demonstrating [...] "obvious loving indulgences". In the pilot, Clair responds to Theo's last minute breakfast request for scrambled eggs after she had already prepared sunny side up eggs for him by using her spatula to [...] "scramble" [...] them. According to The Mommy Myth: The Idealization of Motherhood and How It Has Undermined All Women author Susan Douglas, Clair sometimes makes the mistake of alternating between stern and overindulgent too abruptly. Equally successful in their respective professions, Clair's relationship with Cliff deliberately mirrors the real-life relationship of Cosby and his wife Camille. Clair occasionally raises her voice but seldom yells or loses her temper, demonstrating calmness and a sense of humor as a [...] "remedy for the trials and tribulations of motherhood." ...|$|E
