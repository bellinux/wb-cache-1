5|$|Until {{the sixth}} {{edition of the}} AOU Checklist of North American Birds was {{published}} by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1983, {{the most commonly used}} name for the <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> was the sparrow hawk or sparrowhawk. This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian sparrowhawk in the genus Accipiter. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird <b>American</b> <b>kestrel.</b> Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including grasshopper hawk, due to its diet, and killy hawk, due to its distinct call.|$|E
5|$|The southeastern U.S. {{subspecies}} (Falco sparverius paulus) {{has declined}} 82% since 1940 {{due to a}} decrease in nest site availability. This decline {{is a result of}} longleaf pines being cleared from agricultural fields. Despite this, the <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> is {{a common}} bird used in falconry, {{especially}} by beginners. Though not as strong a flyer as many other larger falcons, proper training and weight control by the falconer allows many American kestrels to become effective hunters of birds in the size range of sparrows and starlings, with occasional success against birds up to approximately twice their own weight.|$|E

40|$|Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius) are {{primarily}} sitand-wait predators {{that rely on}} perches to forage most efficiently. Overwintering Red-tailed Hawks and <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels</b> use available perches (e. g., utility poles and wires, trees, fences, gates, etc.) to hunt for prey items in agricultural fields in northeast Arkansas. Observations were made from December 2011 -March 2012 and November 2012 -March 2013 in three representative cover-types (short rice stubble, soybean stubble, and fallow areas including roadsides) to determine which perch-types were used by Red-tailed Hawks and <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels.</b> Utility pole crossbeams at an average height of 6. 3 m were the main perchtypes used by Red-tailed Hawks, demonstrating the use of man-made structures’. These perches were generally in or near fallow areas or short rice stubble fields. Conversely, <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels</b> usually perched on wires at an average height of 4. 9 m, over fallow roadsides’. Fallow areas had high prey density and vegetation cover. Niche separation via differential use of perches may be one factor that allows these raptors to avoid inter-specific competition...|$|R
25|$|Bald eagles nest on {{the refuge}} and osprey visit {{in search of}} food. Red-tailed hawks and <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> are common raptors that nest here.|$|R
5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
50|$|The Earth Rangers Centre houses over 40 {{animals that}} act as Animal Ambassadors for the organization, {{including}} ring-tailed lemurs, red foxes, bald eagles, African servals, and <b>American</b> <b>kestrels.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> are cavity nesters, {{but they}} are able to adapt {{to a wide variety of}} nesting situations. They {{generally}} prefer natural cavities (such as in trees) with closed tops and tight fitting entrances, as to provide for maximum protection of the eggs and young. Kestrels occasionally nest in holes created by large woodpeckers, or use the abandoned nests of other birds, such as red-tailed hawks, merlins, and crows. They have been recorded nesting on cliff ledges and building tops, as well as in abandoned cavities in cactuses. <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> also commonly utilize nesting boxes.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{include the}} <b>American</b> <b>kestrels,</b> bald and golden eagles. loons, red-necked grebes, sharp-shinned hawks and trumpeter swans. It also {{includes}} the only known nesting site of the whooping crane.|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} wild birds. The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond sufficiently to viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in <b>American</b> <b>kestrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{principle}} {{threat to}} individuals of A. exsul is from other animals which eat ground lizards. Mammalian predators include feral cats, dogs, and mongooses. Avian predators include <b>American</b> <b>kestrels,</b> Greater Antillean grackles, and pearly-eyed thrashers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe pattern {{electroretinogram}} (PERG) {{was used}} to measure the visual acuity and refractive state of nine <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius). Visual acuity was determined from psychometric functions of PERG amplitude vs. spatial frequency. Refractive state was measured by finding the trial lens that resulted in the highest acuity. All nine kestrels were found to be emmetropic. Their median visual acuity was 29 c/deg. The PERG, however, underestimates behaviorally determined visual acuity by approximately 37 %. When adjusted for this underestimation, the median kestrel acuity was 46 c/deg. The visual acuity of <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> is compared to reports in the literature of 17 other species of birds...|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> {{is likely}} the most {{abundant}} falcon in North America, although its total population is difficult to quantify, as local populations can change quickly due to resource availability. Count data from the USGS Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate that the North American breeding population is experiencing long-term and gradual but sustained declines, with some regions, such as New England and coastal California, exhibiting more rapid declines. Count data from raptor migration corridors also indicate regional population declines and largely corroborate BBS data. The North American population has been estimated at 1.2 million pairs, with the Central and South American populations being as large. A smaller estimate is 236,000 birds wintering in North America. A population increase occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries, probably due to deforestation for agriculture. The resulting pastures provided an ideal habitat for kestrels.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{birds of prey}} are broad-winged hawks and <b>American</b> <b>kestrels,</b> {{followed}} by red-tailed hawks, great horned owls, and barred owls. Water birds include the loon, great blue heron, common merganser, spotted sandpiper, and herring gull.|$|R
5|$|Migratory raptors {{native to}} the United States are {{protected}} by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, so <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> are illegal to possess without a permit (such as a falconry permit) in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Reptilian life {{includes}} gopher snakes, king snakes, western racers, garter snakes, rubber boas, ringneck snakes. In {{the skies}} red-tailed hawks, <b>American</b> <b>kestrels,</b> sharp shinned hawks, cooper's hawks, crows, and turkey vultures fly and also great horned owls and many songbirds.|$|R
25|$|Other birds {{found on}} Andros include the loggerhead kingbird, La Sagra's flycatcher, Cuban pewee, Bahama mockingbird, red-legged thrush, thick-billed vireo, black-whiskered vireo, olive-capped warbler, Greater Antillean bullfinch, black-faced grassquit, melodious grassquit, least grebe, olivaceous cormorant, Chickcharney, American flamingo, Bahama pintail, osprey, <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> sooty tern, roseate tern, noddy tern, white-crowned pigeon, zenaida dove, Caribbean dove, smooth-billed ani and Cuban emerald hummingbird.|$|E
25|$|Other unusual {{bird species}} taken include <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> and young short-eared owls. More typical in size are young lark {{buntings}} taken at their fledging time. Reptiles, which can comprise {{large parts of}} a diet, include snakes such as racers, gopher snakes and striped whipsnakes, and lizards. Amphibians may include tiger salamanders and toads. Swainson's hawk is an opportunistic feeder which responds quickly to local concentrations of food.|$|E
25|$|Other mammals {{include the}} harvest mouse, the ground squirrel, and the ornate shrew. Other {{animals in the}} islands include island fence lizard, island scrub jay, harbor seal, California sea lion, island night lizard, barn owl, bald eagles, <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> horned lark and meadowlark and California brown pelican. One hundred and forty-five of these species are unique to the islands and found nowhere else in the world. Marine life ranges from {{microscopic}} plankton to the endangered blue whale, the largest animal ever to live on earth. The oceans surrounding the islands have a rich marine life, species include for instance orcas, swellshark, bat ray, California moray, great white shark and sea lions.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{that can}} be seen in and around Wingo include: Golden Eagles, <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels,</b> Red-tailed Hawks,Northern Harriers, owls, California Quail, Ring-necked Pheasant, bitterns, Turkey Vultures, coyotes, Cottontail Rabbit, shorebirds, ducks, kingfishers, herons, egrets, Mourning Doves, woodpeckers, swallows, songbirds and others.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} and genotyping of wildlife populations provides molecular markers to answer ecological questions. For example, genetic diversity on a population level allows for adaptation and population {{change over time}} and individual heterozygosity may be indicative of fitness (survival or reproduction). We examined microsatellites of <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius) in South Boise, Nampa and Caldwell area. We extracted DNA from blood samples of adult <b>American</b> <b>Kestrels,</b> amplified the DNA in PCR, and ran the products through gel electrophoresis. We looked at six microsatellite regions to score alleles and whether that Kestrel is homozygous or heterozygous for that allele. Results from this study will be useful for understanding genetic diversity within a local population of kestrels...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{was used}} to assess levels of genetic variation within the captive colony of pedigreed <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> (Falco sparverius) which have been maintained for over twenty years at the Avian Science and Conservation Centre of McGill University. Several instances of apparent linkage and allelism were observed. The high probability of fortuitous co-segregation of parental bands as if linked or allelic resulting from the small number of offspring was most likely responsible. Otherwise, the kestrel fingerprints displayed germ-line stability and high levels of heterozygosity characteristic of other species. A positive linear and quasi-linear relationship was found between pedigree-based and DNA fingerprint-based relatedness coefficients. High levels of genetic variation and minimal inbreeding were detected via genetic analyses. Genetic similarity coefficients between colony-bred and free-ranging <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> were not significantly different (P $>$ 0. 5), indicating minimal genetic drift within the colony. Managed mating combined with immigration of new members into the breeding pool can maintain genetic diversity within a captive population of 200 to 300 <b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> for a long term management scale. The captive-bred kestrel population can be fully exploited for general research, management and care techniques and as a genetic and demographic reservoir...|$|R
25|$|The {{forward-facing}} {{eyes of a}} bird of prey give binocular vision, {{which is}} assisted by a double fovea. The raptor's adaptations for optimum visual resolution (an <b>American</b> <b>kestrel</b> can see a 2–mm insect {{from the top of}} an 18–m tree) has a disadvantage in that its vision is poor in low light level, and it must roost at night. Raptors may have to pursue mobile prey in the lower part of their visual field, and therefore do not have the lower field myopia adaptation demonstrated by many other birds. Scavenging birds like vultures do not need such sharp vision, so a condor has only a single fovea with about 35,000 receptors mm2. Vultures, however have high physiological activity of many important enzymes to suit their distant clarity of vision.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in <b>American</b> <b>kestrel,</b> 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep central fovea of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E

5|$|<b>American</b> <b>kestrels</b> feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The <b>American</b> <b>kestrel's</b> primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|R
