Several algorithms for prioritization and release planning have been proposed, where humans with or without machine support enact a series of steps to produce a decision outcome. Instead of applying some specific algorithm to find an acceptable solution to a decision problem, we propose to model SPM decision-making as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where relative and <b>absolute</b> <b>priorities,</b> interdependencies, and other constraints are expressed as relations among variables representing entities such as feature priorities, stakeholder preferences, and resource constraints.

30|$|This paper investigates traffic {{steering}} techniques by static adjustment of mobility parameters in HetNets. To find the optimal user distribution across the network layers, a cell reselection algorithm considering different layer priorities and inter-RAT HOs {{is used for}} {{traffic steering}} purposes. More specifically, first, the problem of allocating <b>absolute</b> <b>priorities</b> (APs) to network layers for cell reselection is analyzed. Second, a procedure to select the optimal thresholds of the 3 GPP events that trigger the inter-RAT HOs is proposed. In this case, the problem arising {{from the use of}} HO triggering events based on the signal level is addressed. When the events are based on the signal level instead of the signal quality, the thresholds involved in these events require a more precise adjustment, especially in multi-layer scenarios, where the location of low-power nodes within the macro-cell may determine the adjustment of the thresholds. The proposed techniques are assessed in a realistic scenario thoroughly deployed to cover hotspots with LTE pico-cells so that the traffic steering policy is to offload traffic to the pico-layers in order to use more efficiently the radio resources and improve service performance. The main contribution of this work is the design of an algorithm to simplify the task of adjusting these thresholds for traffic steering. The impact of the LTE penetration in the mobile terminals is also studied in the LTE/HSPA scenario, where the LTE pico-cells are deployed in areas without LTE macro-coverage.|$|R

Soobramoney v Minister of Health, KwaZulu-Natal 1998 (I) SA 765 (CC) involved a claim ofa breach of the right to health care brought by one person pursuant to s 27 of the Bill of Rights. Grootboom v Oostenburg Municipality 2000 (3) BCLR 277 (C) involves a claim of breaches of rights to housing or shelter brought by some 900 persons under ss 26 and 28. The article seeks to demonstrate why the Court 2 ̆ 7 s judgment in Soobramoney would be problematic if replicated in future cases, most immediately in the appeal decision in Grootboom. The authors argue that the result in Soobramoney may have been correct, but that its reasoning on several fronts should not be treated as a dispositive precedent in the face of better understandings that will evolve as the courts, and the Constitutional Court itself, gradually feel their way forward in the adjudication of social rights. Similarly, the judgment in Grootboom is found wanting for having been far too deferential to government justifications as to why the failure to meet even the core shelter needs of the applicant adults was not a violation of s 26. At the same time, the High Court in Grootboom was too ready to interpret children 2 ̆ 7 s rights to shelter under s 28 as <b>absolute</b> <b>priorities</b> without locating that interpretation in a discussion of the concept of core minimum entitlements, a concept which should have been equally applicable to the s 26 claims of the applicant adults as to the s 28 claims of the children.

The first article concentrates on the solution of housing problem by young Russians and young families. The methods, which are accessible for the citizens of Saratov, were analyzed in terms of the hardest ways without privileges and government support: pledge, housing rent and deposit. The authors presented the digital data on comparison between the popular pledge of OJSC Sberbank and similar ones at the start conditions of housing rent and deposits. Theyve specified the possibility of the reducing time and the amount of payment of the purchased apartment from 20 years, where is the amount of overpayment is 1 850 498, to 4. 5 - 7 years, altogether without overpayments. The basic risks when using discussed ways of the accommodation purchase were demonstrated and specific examples of risks in Saratov were given. There are no <b>absolute</b> <b>priorities</b> when choosing the way of the accommodation purchase, there are examples in the article of a sharp increase of the efficiency within the pledge, and the rent on condition that only one factor has changed.

As a result we made a conclusion that in spite of the real impossibility to plan and predict the changes, the success of individual strategy of life in solving housing and other important problems depends on the perception and understanding of the changes, on the early use for practical purposes and on the existing life stereotypes...|$|R

Packet drop, delay variation, and random channel fading calls for variations of scheduling technique {{to address the}} challenging technical difficulties arising due to the migration from circuit switched domain. A new challenge of starvation comes due to provisioning different services with different delay requirements. This paper proposes a new semi-persistent scheme of MAC scheduling to adaptively prioritize VoIP traffic by not forcing other traffics to starve. The proposed scheme, which combines VoIP priority mode with user coupling, allows to utilize the system capacity efficiently.

As the European Commission’s in-house science service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) supports the Commission in fulfilling the obligations originally {{set up by the}} Euratom (European Atomic Energy Community) Treaty in the areas of nuclear research, training and education, and radiation protection. The JRC’s nuclear research activities are defined in a Council Regulation on the research and training programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2014 - 18), which complements the EU framework programme for research and innovation, Horizon 2020. The activities also fulfil the legal obligations under the Euratom Treaty (chapter III arts 36 and 39), and under several Euratom recommendations, decisions and directives. The March 2011 Council as well as nuclear summits conclusions also emphasise the need to give priority to the highest standards for nuclear {{safety and security}} in the Union and internationally. There are currently around 130 nuclear reactors in operation in 14 EU countries, which produce approximately one third of the European Union’s electricity. The choice to use nuclear power or not in the energy mix of each of the 28 EU Member States is a national decision and currently the situation differs significantly among them. Some Member States have nuclear phase-out policies, whilst some others are opting for long-term operation and lifetime extension of their nuclear plants. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the work of the JRC, the European Commission’s in-house science service in the domain of nuclear safety and security. This research area encompasses the safety of nuclear reactors and the nuclear fuel itself, the safe operation of nuclear energy systems, as well as nuclear safeguards, non-proliferation and the fight against illicit activities involving nuclear and radiological material. The description of the JRC’s work is divided into five chapters, each chapter describing JRC research and relevant scientific outputs in the area, linked to their policy background and context.

40|$|Cape Verde, located off {{the coast}} of Senegal in western Africa, is a {{volcanic}} archipelago where a combination of human, climatic, geomorphologic and pedologic factors has led to extensive degradation of the soils. Like other Sahelian countries, Cape Verde has suffered the effects of desertification through the years, threatening the livelihood of the islands population and its fragile environment. In fact, the steep slopes in the ore agricultural islands, together with semi-arid and arid environments, characterized by an irregular and poorly distributed rainy season, with high intensity rainfall events, make dryland production a challenge. To survive in these fragile conditions, the stabilization of the farming systems and the maintenance of sustainable yields have become <b>absolute</b> <b>priorities,</b> making the islands an erosion control laboratory. Soil and water conservation strategies have been a centerpiece of the government 0 s agricultural policies for the last half century. Aiming to maintain the soil in place and the water inside the soil, the successive governments of Cape Verde have implemented a number of soil and water conservation techniques, the most common ones being terraces, half moons, live barriers, contour rock walls, contour furrows and microcatchments, check dams and reforestation with drought resistant species. The soil and water conservation techniques implemented have contributed to the improvement of the economical and environmental conditions of the treated landscape, making crop production possible, consequently, improving the livelihood of the people living on the islands. In this paper, we survey the existing soil and water conservation techniques, analyze their impact on the livelihood condition of the population through a thorough literature review and field monitoring using a semi-quantitative methodology and evaluate their effectiveness and impact on crop yield in the Ribeira Seca watershed. A brief discussion is given on the cost and effectiveness of the techniques to reduce soil erosion and to promote rainfall infiltration. Finally, we discuss the critical governance factors that lead to the successful implementation of such strategy in a country with scarce natural resources...|$|R

Packets of both classes arrive {{according to}} a two-class discrete batch Markovian arrival process (2 -DBMAP), {{taking into account the}} correlated nature of arrivals in heterogeneous telecommunication networks. The model incorporates time and space priority to provide different types of service to each class. One of both classes receives <b>absolute</b> time <b>priority</b> in order to minimize its delay. Space priority is implemented by the partial buffer sharing acceptance policy and can be provided to the class receiving time priority or to the other class. This choice gives rise to two different queueing models and this paper analyses both these models in a unified manner. Furthermore, the buffer finiteness and the use of space priority raise some issues on the order of arrivals in a slot. This paper does not assume that all arrivals from one class enter the queue before those of the other class. Instead, a string representation for sequences of arriving packets and a probability measure on the set of such strings are introduced. This naturally gives rise to the notion of intra-slot space priority. Performance of these queueing systems is then determined using matrix-analytic techniques. The numerical examples explore the range of service differentiation covered by both models...|$|R
