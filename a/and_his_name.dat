5|$|Coward spelled {{his first}} name with the diæresis ("I didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The {{language}} did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!"). The press and many book publishers failed to follow suit, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was printed as 'Noel' in The Times, The Observer and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of Noël Coward are held in the University of Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} 1781 and, in his 30-year career, he saw {{action at the}} major French defeats and {{victories}} in Europe. He fought in André Masséna's Army of Switzerland, where he participated in the Winterthur and First and Second Battles of Zürich, the campaigns of 1806 against Prussia, and Napoleon's invasion of Russia. After the Russian and Saxon campaign, while suffering from exhaustion, he contracted typhus and died in Kusel, in the Saarland. He was buried at the Panthéon, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> is listed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Isidore {{was widely}} {{influential}} throughout the Middle Ages, feeding directly into word lists and encyclopaedias by Papias, Huguccio, Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais, {{as well as}} being used everywhere in the form of small snippets. He was cited by Dante Alighieri, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was mentioned by the poets Bocaccio, Petrarch and John Gower among others. Dante {{went so far as to}} place Isidore in Paradise in the final part of his Divine Comedy, Paradiso (10.130–131).|$|E
5|$|McGee is commemorated on a war cenotaph {{located in}} Ross, Tasmania, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> {{was given to}} the McGee Soldiers' Club at Anglesea Army Barracks, Tasmania, which was opened in 1956. During the 150th anniversary {{celebrations}} of the town of Avoca in March 1984, the Governor of Tasmania, Sir James Plimsoll, unveiled a memorial plaque on the Returned Serviceman's League cenotaph honouring McGee; his widow and their daughter attended the ceremony. McGee's Victoria Cross and other medals are held in the collections of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named Alligator Reef. Her crew failed to refloat the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of Alligator final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was used as a rallying cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on the stump in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> {{came to the attention of}} professional fighters. At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27minutes and decided to become a professional.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 2015, Hyman {{was part}} of a quartet of University of Michigan student-athletes who were named Capital One First Team Academic All-District selections, the {{announcement}} coming from the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was put forward for Academic All-American consideration. On June 11, 2015, Hyman was named to the 2015 Capital One Academic All-America Division I Men's At-Large team, as selected by CoSIDA. Hyman was the second ice hockey player at Michigan to be named an Academic All-America honoree, following Jeff Jillson in 2001, and the first to be named First Team Academic All American.|$|E

5|$|Siward can {{be found}} {{witnessing}} numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A Dux ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, {{and this may be}} Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at Lincoln—between Wulfwig, Bishop of Dorchester, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.|$|E
5|$|That same {{evening the}} Senate convened at the Temple of Concord and summarily {{condemned}} Sejanus to death. He was led from prison and strangled. His body was cast onto the Gemonian stairs, where the crowd tore it to pieces. Riots ensued, in which crowds hunted and killed anyone they could link to Sejanus. The Praetorians also resorted to looting, {{when they were}} accused of having conspired with the former prefect. Following the issue of damnatio memoriae by the Senate, his statues were torn down <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> obliterated from all public records. On October 24, Sejanus' eldest son Strabo was arrested and executed. Upon learning of his death, Apicata committed suicide (October 26), after addressing a letter to Tiberius, claiming that Drusus had been poisoned with the complicity of Livilla. The accusations were further corroborated by confessions from Livilla's slaves, who, under torture, admitted to having administered the poison to Drusus.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{nonetheless}} rejoiced at {{the death}} of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed damnatio memoriae on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> was erased from all public records. Domitian and, over a century later, Publius Septimius Geta were the only emperors known to have officially received a damnatio memoriae, though others may have received de facto ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the Cancelleria Reliefs, were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material. Yet {{the order of the}} Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.|$|E

5|$|Tyrone Anthony Wheatley, Sr. (born January 19, 1972) is {{the running}} backs {{coach of the}} NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars and a former {{professional}} American football player who played 10seasons in the National Football League (NFL) {{and was one of}} the most successful high school and collegiate athletes in Metropolitan Detroit history. In high school, he was a member of state-champion teams in both track and field and football, and he was named Michigan's track and field athlete of the year and football athlete of the year in the same academic year. He earned All-America track honors in both high school and college. Following his graduation as one of Michigan's best high school athletes, he attended the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship and earned first-team All-Big Ten Conference honors on Big Ten Champion football and track teams. He ranks among the Wolverines' all-time rushing leaders in numerous categories, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>name</b> appears in several places in the Big Ten football record book. He was named to All-Big Ten teams in football and track and field a total of four times, and he earned portions of seven Big Ten championships (two team awards for football, one team award for indoor track, one award for 110 meter hurdles, and three awards for individual football statistical performances).|$|E
