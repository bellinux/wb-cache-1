The prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious illnesses including malignant lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis). The trade and use of asbestos have been restricted or banned in many jurisdictions. Asbestos became increasingly popular among manufacturers and builders in the late 19th century because of its sound absorption, average tensile strength, its resistance to fire, heat, electrical and chemical damage, and affordability. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation.|$|E

40|$|Erionite is {{a zeolite}} {{representing}} a well-known health hazard. In fact, exposure of humans to its fibers has been unequivocally associated with occurrence of malignant mesothelioma. For this reason, a multi-methodological approach, based upon field investigation, morphological characterization, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) /energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) chemical analysis and structure refinement through X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was applied to different samples of potentially carcinogenic erionite from Northern Italy. The studied crystals have a chemical composition ranging from erionite-Ca to erionite-Na and display variable morphologies, varying from prismatic, through acicular and fibrous, to extremely fibrous <b>asbestiform</b> habits. The fibrous samples were characterized by an unusual preferred partition of aluminum (Al) at tetrahedral site T 1 instead of tetrahedral site T 2. Further, a mismatch between the a-parameter of erionite-Ca and levyne-Ca that are intergrown in the <b>asbestiform</b> sample was detected. This misfit was coupled to a relevant microstrain to maintain structure coherency at the boundary. Erionite occurs in 65 % of the investigated sites, with an estimated quantity of 10 to 40 vol% of the associated minerals. The presence of this mineral is of concern for risk to human health, especially if one considers the vast number of quarries and mining-related activities that are operating in the zeolite host rocks.

40|$|Asbestos is a {{commercial}} term referring to 6 fibrous minerals from 2 mineralogical classes: serpentine and amphibole. Chrysotile, or white asbestos, {{is the only}} serpentine mineral. The <b>asbestiform</b> habit of amphi-bole asbestos is far more toxic than chrysotile. However, most amphibole minerals {{are found in the}} “non-asbestiform ” state that pose few, if any, health risks. Comminution, whether deliberate during crush-ing or grinding, or incidental in usage may produce structures known as “cleavage fragments ” {{from a wide variety of}} sources. A considerable body of evidence, gathered over the last 30 years, demonstrates that amphibole cleavage fragments do not show the same toxicity as their <b>asbestiform</b> analogues. Since there still continues to be confusion and controversy on this point, this review is aimed at resolving a major portion of this controversy. It has done so by bringing together the supporting mineralogical, animal and human evidence from many sources. These observations demonstrate that cleavage fragments and amphibole asbestos fibers have fundamentally different properties and these differences are biologically relevant. Indeed, the toxicity of respirable cleavage fragments is so much less than that of the fibrous amphiboles that by any reasonable measure they are not biologically harmful...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} is a sentinel neoplasm {{for population}} exposure to <b>asbestiform</b> fibers. Public health officials may be alerted to temporal or spatial clustering of malignant mesothelioma through analyses of vital records, such as death certificates. Hence, {{the maintenance of}} the integrity of the vital statistics system, particularly the cause of death statement on the death certificate, is very important. The report by a northeastern Minnesota radiologist in January 1985 of an elevated prevalence of pleural plaques (related to <b>asbestiform</b> fiber exposure) to the Minnesota Department of Health resulted in an investigation of pleural malignant mesothelioma mortality trends in that area and in three other similar areas in the State. In that study, we noted that in several instances malignant mesothelioma (either intrathoracic or unspecified site) was listed on the death certificate in such a manner as to imply that the neoplasm was either a lung cancer or a malignancy of an unspecified site. The effect of this misclassification is to underestimate the mortality from malignant mesothelioma by fourfold to eightfold.

40|$|Background While talc {{containing}} <b>asbestiform</b> fibers {{is considered}} a human carcinogen, only limited animal and human data are available on non-asbestiform talc. To provide further evaluation on the issue, we updated the analysis of an Italian cohort of talc miners and millers in Val Chisone; talc found here is free from <b>asbestiform</b> fibers. Methods The cohort was comprised of 1, 795 men {{who had worked for}} at least 1 year in the mine and/or in the factory between 1946 and 1995. Vital status and death certificates were obtained from registration offices in the municipality of death or of birth. Employment, termination of employment, and detailed job history were obtained from personnel records at the plant. Results No excess was found for total cancer mortality, nor mortality for lung cancer. No case of mesothelioma was reported. There was a significant excess mortality from non-neoplastic respiratory diseases (SMR 228. 2, 95 % CI 190. 2 – 271. 5). Mortality excess for non-neoplastic respiratory diseases was mainly due to silicosis. Conclusions This study provides additional support for an association between talc in mining and milling and non-neoplastic respiratory diseases, while showing no significant excess risk for lung cancer and mesothelioma.

40|$|ABSTRACT Around {{the town}} of Qermik in {{south-east}} Turkey there are many deposits of <b>asbestiform</b> minerals, {{some of which are}} used to make whitewash or stucco. A sample of 7000 of the population revealed 461 (65 %) with pleural thickening and calcification, of whom 103 (147 % of the total) had evidence of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Forty-one patients with respiratory cancer were admitted to the Diyarbakir Chest Hospital from around Qermik and from a comparable area of equal population (but without asbestos deposits) in 1977 - 8. Of these 23 were mesotheliomas, 22 coming from around Qermik. In addition, 11 of the 18 primary bronchial cancers came from around Qermik. A similar excess of mesothelioma and bronchial cancer had been admitted from the §ermik area in previous years. The whitewash or stucco material has been shown to contain fibrous tremolite and non-fibrous antigorite/lizardite, chlorite, and talc. A lung biopsy of a patient from Qermik contained large numbers of tremolite fibres, both free and forming asbestos bodies. There were only occasional chrysotile fibres.

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>asbestiform</b> minerals {{has to be}} foreseen in the planning of infrastructural activities: Asbestos can be a component of sedimentary rocks or of mafic and ultra mafic metamorphic rocks. Surveys and core drilling, {{in addition to providing}} important information {{on the quality of the}} rock and its geotechnical characteristics, allow for a prediction of the {{presence of}} <b>asbestiform</b> minerals in the areas affected by mining or infrastructural activities. During the excavation, workers can be exposed to the asbestos risk, therefore, the control of the air quality and of the excavated materials are fundamental for the safety of involved people. In this work some problems we met in the analysis of airborne filters and bulk samples from sites in northern Italy are presented. The asbestos fibers present in rocks as accessory minerals, are often different in habit and dimension from the well-known asbestos fibers used as industrial minerals and moreover can be erroneously identified as minerals morphologically and chemically similar present in the same rock or environment. In the case of tunnel muck it could be contaminated by substances used for the excavation that could modify colours and optical properties of asbestos minerals. In the PCOM (Phase Contrast Optical Microscope) analysis chrysotile, sepiolite and antigorite, due to their different refraction index, when the fibers have dimension > 0, 5 micron and aren't contaminated by lubricant can be easely identified even if the morphology of chrysotile is very similar to that of sepiolite. In Electron Scanning Microscope (SEM) the discrimination between chrysotile and antigorite on the airborne filters is not always possible because the fibers of thin dimensions show similar habit and spectrum. In the case of the tremolite amphibole, morphology changes from prismatic to fibrous depending on its origin (p. eg. Monastero, Val Grana, Verrayes, Brachiello). Both prismatic and <b>asbestiform</b> tremolite (Gamble and Gibbs, 2007; Addison and McConnel, 2007) may show inhalable elements with width less than 3 micron, length more than 5 micron and width length ratio 1 : 3, whose dangerousness (fiber coming from fibrous tremolite or the cleavage fragments coming from prismatic tremolite) could be different and it is object of epidemiologic studies...|$|E
