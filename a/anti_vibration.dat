50|$|<b>Anti</b> <b>vibration</b> gloves are {{traditionally}} {{made with a}} thick and soft palm material to insulate from the vibrations. The protection is highly dependent on frequency range, most gloves provide no protection in palm and wrist below ~50Hz and in fingers below ~400Hz. Factors such as high grip force, cold hands or vibration forces in shear direction is reducing effect and or increase damage to hand and arm. Gloves do help to keep hands warm but to get the desired effect, the frequency output from the tool must match {{the properties of the}} vibration glove that is selected. It should be noted that <b>Anti</b> <b>Vibration</b> gloves in many cases amplify the vibrations at frequencies lower than in the text above.|$|E
50|$|The BFI IMAX was {{designed}} by Bryan Avery of Avery Associates Architects and completed in May 1999. The screen is the largest in Britain (20m high and 26m wide). It has a seating capacity of just under 500 and a 12,000 Watt digital surround sound system. Although the site is surrounded by traffic and has an underground line just four metres below, the architects and engineers accounted for this in their design and the entire upper structure sits on <b>anti</b> <b>vibration</b> bearings to prevent noise propagation.|$|E
40|$|Natural rubber is {{used for}} a variety of {{applications}} and especially in tyres and <b>anti</b> - <b>vibration</b> mounts, because of its superior mechanical properties. The useful (service) life of the rubber can be affected by the presence of flaws introduced during fabrication and by conditions experienced during service. In order to assess and predict the functional life of a natural rubber (NR) engine mount compound, the effect of ageing and the presence of deliberately introduced flaws on the physical and failure properties were determined.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic and static {{frequency}} of the rotor about diameter of 1. 4 m small {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} was tested by using PULSE 16. 1 structural vibration analysis system., through combining the data of static frequency to identify rotor Dynamic frequency using spectrum analysis method. The conclusions found that, at a yaw condition of constant rotor speed, vibration acceleration of axial movement, disc effect and first order vibration of rotor increased with the increase of the yaw angle. The reason was that yaw exciting force which generated by the yaw behavior increased with the increase of yaw angle. At a constant load yaw, vibration acceleration of axial float, disc effect increased with the increase of the yaw angle. At the yaw condition of constant load R= 82 Ω, R= 118 Ω and the yaw angle 25 °, 30 °,the acceleration value sharp increased and occurred the machine resonance phenomenon due to the tower instability. First order symmetric and <b>anti</b> symmetric <b>vibration</b> acceleration of rotor decreased with the increase of the yaw angle. The reason was that after the wind turbine yaw, the speed decreased of rotor caused the centrifugal force of the blades decreased, the impact of the centrifugal load changed was far greater than yaw exciting force for the first order vibration acceleration. The study also found that vibration acceleration values of rotor first order anti symmetric was greater than axial movement, disc effect and first order symmetric vibration acceleration values, which shows that stress concentration in root of blade was large and the blade fatigue damage was more serious. This paper related research results can provided a new analytical thinking for rotor fatigue damage or breakage occurred frequently in wind turbine operation process, and may provide a reference for the vibration characteristics of rotor in the process of yaw...|$|R
5000|$|At first, Lana is imprisoned {{inside a}} room with a {{foldable}} TV screen with only 3 channels, one of which only works for 20 minutes a day and displays the same telescreen that she used to work in. Soon, the Heart begins to trust her more and lets her out and shows her around. He shows her the view {{from the top of the}} factory and shows her the wires running from the factory in the direction of the city. He explains that via these wires, each power up, everybody hooks themselves up to the factory which gives them energy. Lana is on the verge of committing suicide, but the Heart convinces her the life is worth living. He explains that he himself came to the Factory attempting to change something after his wife died due to lack of energy before giving birth to their daughter, but realized that the Factory must keep running in order to keep everybody living, but with less and less wild people, the Factory won't be able to last forever and give everyone energy. He shows Lana several other things. He shows her a computer that he can use to control what is being said on the 20 minute telescreen presentation all the way in the city. He also shows her a cart in the basement of the Factory which runs on the energy of mating slugs. Lana deduces that he uses this cart to get back to the city. The Heart also explains how the Dessicator works. He tells her that the Dessicator is the [...] "oven" [...] of the factory. It's a membrane that will detect the natural vibration of a person, and cause an <b>anti</b> <b>vibration</b> that fills the person, turning them to ashes and leaving the person's pure energy behind which is then absorbed by the factory. His description reminds Lana of the fire pit on which Lana fought with the Queen Mother, and the Heart explains that the fire pit actually transferred all of the Queen Mother's energy into Lana upon Lana's victory.|$|E
40|$|Electronic units form a {{considerable}} {{part of the}} spacecraft bus mass budget, and a significant mass saving could be made by improving their mechanical design. Attention is focussed on the analysis of typical enclosures for electronics, and the <b>anti</b> <b>vibration</b> devices for the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) currently used within the enclosures. A crucial step to improve the equipment design is the accurate prediction of the vibration response of the electronics (i. e. populated PCBs), to the vibration environment experienced during launch. FE models of PCBs and Anti-Vibration Frames are presented and compared with the results obtained during random vibration test...|$|E
40|$|Engine {{vibrations}} {{have been}} one of the major problems for the engine manufacturers in the world. The engine excitation forces, arising from the gas pressure and unbalance forces are the sources of vibrations. <b>Anti</b> <b>Vibration</b> Mounts(AVMs) are the structures used to absorb the vibrations and dampen the harm causing forces. Mount result in a system which is modeled as mass/spring/damper. The elastomer is under vertical and shear load at the same time. The engine is bolted freely on mount which dampens the vibrations going to the base frame/canopy. The validation of their characteristics is implemented in a single degree of freedom system with response to frequency domain. The engine is mounted freely on the AVM’s which helps to dampen the vibrations to base frame. Frequency Response Function(FRF) is derived for analysis, analytically and Computer Aided Engineering(CAE). Comparative is also made to suggest which material is to be selected for AVMs. A single AVM is analyzed for modal and frequency response with the upper plate as a part of engine structure and the bottom plate as the base frame. Comparative study of the two conditions using materials and also without mount and with mount is analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Ride comfort, driving {{stability}} and drivability are vital factors {{in terms of}} vehicle performance and the customer satisfaction. The power plant (IC engine) is the source for the vibration that reduces the vehicle performance and it need to be controlled to some extent such that the vehicle performance will be improved. The IC engine {{is made up of}} reciprocating and rotating parts and they produce unbalanced forces during their operation and produce the vibratory output at the vehicle supporting members. The vibration reduction will be possible by minimizing unbalanced forces and by providing the <b>anti</b> <b>vibration</b> mounts at the engine-vehicle interface. Many researches were made to find the causes for the vibration and to reduce the vibrations at the engine supports. But still there is a research gap on the vibration modeling and vibration isolation of the engine. In this work, an attempt is made to represent the state-of-the- art for the engine vibrations and its isolations and to provide a gate way for the future work on it. It reveals the various work carried out on the engine multibody modeling of the IC engine components and different engine mountsand their orientations. The review is structured as engine multibody modeling, engine vibrations and engine mounting areas and revealed the gaps and untouched parts that requires further research...|$|E
