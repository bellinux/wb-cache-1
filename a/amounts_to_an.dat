5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

5|$|During the {{election}} period, a candidate is {{not permitted to}} spend more than $600,000 or 30 cents for each person on the electoral register, whichever is the greater amount. For the 2017 election, {{based on the number of}} electors as at 28 August 2017, {{the election}} expenses limit was $754,982.40. It <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> illegal practice to pay to transport voters to or from the poll; or to pay a voter for the use of premises to display a notice, unless the voter is an advertising agent or the transaction is carried out in the ordinary course of business. It is also an illegal practice for a person to borrow or lend, hire or rent out, or use any motor vehicle to convey voters other than himself and his family members to or from the poll. Committing an illegal practice is a criminal offence, the penalty for which is a fine of up to $2,000 and disqualification for three years from being a voter or a candidate for Parliament or the office of President.|$|E
5|$|The person {{chosen to}} fill the {{position}} was statesman and former congressman Elias Boudinot. Upon assuming his duties at the Mint on October 28, Boudinot was informed of the silver standard {{that had been used}} since the first official silver coins were struck. He immediately ordered that this practice be ceased and that coinage would begin in the 89.2% fineness approved by the Coinage Act of 1792. The total production of 1795 dollars (including both the Flowing Hair and Draped Bust types) totalled 203,033. It is estimated that approximately 42,000 dollars were struck bearing the Draped Bust design. Boudinot soon ordered that production of minor denominations be increased. Later, assayer Albian Cox died suddenly from a stroke in his home on November 27, 1795, leaving the vital post of assayer vacant. This, together with Boudinot's increased focus on smaller denominations, as well as a lull in private bullion deposits (the fledgling Mint's only source of bullion), caused a decrease in silver dollar production in 1796. The total mintage for 1796 was 79,920, which <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> approximate 62% reduction from the previous year's total.|$|E

25|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected in}} this manner was absolutely inconsistent and as previously noted everybody detained was released after brief periods of time. In fact it all <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> illegal system of mass-indexing and psychological terrorism. The police were aware that the judicial authority would not have confirmed these arrests but proceeded equally with a different objective. The aim was not to arrest presumed offenders but the indexing of {{a great number of}} demonstrators, the psychological intimidation of the protesters and the creation of false records to be used in other occasions.|$|E
25|$|In a {{partnership}} or joint venture where money is lent, the creditor only provides the capital yet is guaranteed {{a fixed amount}} of profit. The debtor, however, puts in time and effort, but is made to bear the risk of loss. Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust. As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> equity stake in the business).|$|E

25|$|Not every unfair act <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unfair labor practice; as an example, {{failing to}} pay an {{individual}} worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might {{be a violation of}} the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.|$|E
25|$|In 1686, 40 {{years after}} Mogila's death, the Ottomans, {{acting on the}} behalf of the regent of Russia Sophia Alekseyevna, {{pressured}} the Patriarch of Constantinople into transferring the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' from the jurisdiction of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow, established a century prior to that. The legality of this step is occasionally questioned to this day along {{with the fact that}} the transfer was accompanied by graft and bribery, which in church affairs <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ecclesiastical crime. The transfer itself, however, led to the significant Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continued well into the 18th century, Feofan Prokopovich, Epifany Slavinetsky, Stephen Yavorsky and Demetrius of Rostov being among the most notable representatives of this trend.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application {{was made in the}} hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> error of law, and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office even if he is successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E

The tax incentives given {{by the state of}} Washington and believed to be the largest in US history surpassing the previous record of $5.6bn over 30 years awarded by the state of New York to the aluminum producer Alcoa in 2007. The $8.7bn over 40 years incentive to Boeing to manufacture the 777X in the state includes $4.2bn from a 40% reduction in business taxes, £3.5bn in tax credits for the firm, a $562m tax credit on property and buildings belonging to Boeing, a $242m sales tax exemption for buying computers and $8m to train 1000 workers, Airbus alleges this is larger than the budgeted cost of Boeing's 777X development program and the EU argues <b>amounts</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> entire publicly funded free aircraft program for Boeing, the legislation was an extension of the duration of a tax break program given to Boeing for Dreamliner development that had already been ruled illegal by the WTO in 2012.
