40|$|Since 1998, sales {{channels}} for investment trusts have expanded in Japan. We expected this {{to result in}} greater demand for investment trusts but these expectations {{have yet to be}} met. The underlying causes of investment trusts' slow growth may be due to negative net returns to individual investors during the economic downturn - i. e., after deducting costs from dividends. When the Japanese economy is sluggish, <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> <b>companies</b> should invest in high-growth Asia, among other regions, rather than the domestic market. And when domestic financial markets are strong, the companies should invest more in Japanese markets. Investment trusts are the vehicle for seizing world economic trends. However, the performance of Japan's investment trusts has not been as good as that of the United States (US). To further enhance demand for investment trusts, their fee structure must be changed so that <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> <b>companies,</b> distributors, and individual investors seek the same goals.
