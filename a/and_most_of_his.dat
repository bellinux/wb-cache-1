5|$|Isa's {{early life}} is obscure. He {{was a member}} of the Shayban tribe from the Jazira, but {{otherwise}} not even the exact name of his father is known, it being variously given as al-Shaykh, Ahmad or Abd al-Razzak. Isa first appears in 848, in the ranks of the Abbasid army under Bugha al-Sharabi that was sent against the rebel Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith in his stronghold of Marand. Muhammad <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> followers belonged to the Rabi'a tribal group, the same that the Shayban were part of. Consequently Bugha employed Isa as an envoy to the rebels, and Isa managed to convince several among them to surrender.|$|E

Grant's army included 32 out of 62 infantry regiments who had combat experience at Fort Donelson. One half of his artillery batteries <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cavalry were also combat veterans.|$|E

While Pyrrhus <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E
