After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the previous owner with {{the woman from the}} apartment.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2000 season, Six Flags New England {{was known}} as Riverside Park. Six Flags {{purchased}} the park and added their own DC Comics theming. The site that Superman the Ride operates on is the former site of the Riverside Park Speedway. The Speedway was demolished after the 1999 season {{to make room for}} a new themed area, DC Superhero Adventure. As part of the $40 million expansion, the park built Superman: Ride of Steel. Six Flags worked with Swiss manufacturer, Intamin, to build and design the ride a year earlier. The final track piece of Superman was installed on March 27, 2000, about 40 days before opening day. The ride officially opened on May 5, 2000 as the tallest and longest roller coaster on the East Coast of the United States. The entrance and station were themed to Superman with Superman logos <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him located above the entrance. The second tunnel also had a mist effect.|$|E
5|$|As soon as late 1961, United Artists {{started a}} {{marketing}} campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, {{as well as}} a booklet detailing the Bond character <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven.|$|E

25|$|In about 1850, Burns {{gave his}} lectures in Manchester {{and one of}} the people in the {{audience}} was the wife of William Leonard Williams who was to be sent like his father as a missionary to New Zealand. In 1853 W. L. Williams presented Burns' booklet <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Burns to his son, Hori Waiti, in front of a crowd at Tokomaru Bay. Williams had already checked the veracity of the booklet and picture, but he asked publicly if Burns was recognised and it was confirmed and Hori Waiti learnt that Burns was his father. This picture of Barnet Burns is still in the family.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{hypothesis is that}} learners {{in this type of}} task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge {{at the end of the}} training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants were truly updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a shoe, and hears the nonsense word vash she might hypothesize that vash refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a door and again hear the word vash. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word vash 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of vash (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of vash) and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that vash referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.|$|E
25|$|The Humanitarian Daily Ration (HDR) is a {{self-contained}} Halal meal {{designed to be}} given to refugees and other displaced people. It is designed to feed a single person for a full day, and the menus were intended to be palatable to many religious and cultural tastes around the globe. To meet this goal, no animal products or by-products, no alcohol or alcohol-based products, and minimal dairy products are used in their production. It is otherwise created and packaged much like MREs; feedback from the Afghanistan campaign led to the interior packing being reinforced to withstand being air-dropped, as the packets sometimes ruptured on impact. The outer bag is tinted a high-visibility red or yellow and has an American Flag <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a person eating out of the bag with a spoon. There are usually instructions printed on it in English and one or more local languages as well.|$|E
25|$|George Orson Welles {{was born}} May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He {{was named after}} his {{paternal}} great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story {{of the source of}} his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), {{and the two of them}} sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.|$|E

25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research thus far has focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} cue cards. Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. Additional research is needed to replicate the results of the limited studies that have been conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E
