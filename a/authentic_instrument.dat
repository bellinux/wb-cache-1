60|$|The English barons had privileges, {{which they}} knew {{to have been}} violated; they had always kept up {{the memory of the}} ancient Saxon liberty; and if they were the conquerors of Britain, they did not think that their own {{servitude}} was the just fruit of their victory. They had, however, but an indistinct view of the object at which they aimed; they rather felt their wrongs than understood the cause of them; and having no head nor council, they were more in a condition of distressing their king and disgracing their country by their disobedience than of applying any effectual remedy to their grievances. Langton saw these dispositions, and these wants. He had conceived a settled plan for reducing the king, and all his actions tended to carry it into execution. This prelate, under pretence of holding an ecclesiastical synod, drew together privately some of the principal barons to the Church of St. Paul in London. There, having expatiated on the miseries which the kingdom suffered, and having explained {{at the same time the}} liberties to which it was entitled, he produced the famous charter of Henry the First, long concealed, and of which, with infinite difficulty, he had procured an authentic copy. This he held up to the barons as the standard about which they were to unite. These were the liberties which their ancestors had received by the free concession of a former king, and these the rights which their virtue was to force from the present, if (which God forbid!) they should find it necessary to have recourse to such extremities. The barons, transported to find an <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> to justify their discontent and to explain and sanction their pretensions, covered the Archbishop with praises, readily confederated to support their demands, and, binding themselves by every obligation of human and religious faith, to vigor, unanimity, and secrecy, they depart to confederate others in their design.|$|E

40|$|The EU Succession Regulation (Regulation 650 / 2012) {{allows for}} {{cross-border}} circulation of authentic instruments {{in a matter}} of succession. Authentic instruments are documents created by authorised authorities which benefit from certain evidential advantages. As this Regulation does not harmonise Member State substantive laws or procedures concerning succession the laws relating to the domestic evidentiary effects of succession authentic instruments remain diverse.

40|$|This {{research}} {{faces the}} problematic of the <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> drawn up formally by public notaries as a suitable enforcement instrument, especially {{related to their}} 'enforcement in natura' or their specific performance under the scope of national and European legislation. Although the <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> is a well known enforcement instrument in civil law countries due to the Brussels Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of Judgements in civil and commercial matters (modified by the Council Regulation (EC) 44 / 2001, of 22 December 2000) the <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> has gained importance and could well play in the future an important role. It is essential not to forget that under {{the scope of the}} Brussels Convention a document which has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic and is enforceable in one Contracting State shall be enforceable in the State in which enforcement is sought. Therefore the <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> can be enforced in a country in which these instruments are unknown or even that they do not allow their enforcement, when claim of specific performance is being seeked. As a result, it is our duty to establish whether in the civil law countries a common 'ratione materiae' for the authentic instruments does exist and if this enables us to speak of a 'Common European Authentic Instrument'. Therefore main interest lies in the compared study of the different forms of public notaries as well as their capacity of drawing up enforceable instrument in Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Austria under national legislation. Throughout the above mentioned countries different legal situations are to be taken into account, but they all allow the enforcement for a claim of payment. On the other hand Germany, Austria, Portugal do allow the specific performance, but in France, Italy and Spain this is not the case. Therefore is it possible to modify or reform the legislations or are we in front of an unavoidable obstacle. At this stage {{we should point out that}} in recent times a discussion towards reintroducing specific performance as a remedy has been put forward and adopted by some legislators. Last but not least, special attention is also payed to the challenges that the European Notaries are and will be facing in the so called European Integration Process and their possible solutions...|$|E

40|$|The European legal space unites Member States with {{different}} legal systems. The {{majority of them}} recognize {{the concept of an}} <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument,</b> as the primary instrument for preventive justice and the Notary as the person and institution, in whom the state has vested the right to authenticate certain transactions and facts. Other Member States do not recognize the concept of an <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> and the institution of a Notary, who is responsible for drawing such instruments. Within the European Union there is no single or unified document – a “European Authentic Instrument”. So this paper wants to draw attention upon the necessity to define the criteria an act has to comply with, in order to be considered as an “authentic instrument” and to enable its special effects to be recognized in a Member State different from the Member State of origin. In order to completely fulfil the objectives of Regulation 650 from 2012, to eliminate the obstacles to the free movement of persons within the European Union, through eliminating the difficulties in exercising their rights in the areas, related to succession with international consequences, the Regulation includes provisions, regulating the acceptance and execution of authentic instruments...|$|E
40|$|Information {{gathering}} is a {{very important}} aspect of the design process, one that is used continuously throughout the project to make informed design decisions. This study reports the development of an <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> used to assess skills related to information gathering in first-year engineering students. Existing assessment tools, such as the scenario-based Self- Knowledge Inventory of Lifelong Learning (SKILLS), developed by Conti 2 ̆ 6 Fellenz, or the Self- Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), developed by Guglielmino, were evaluated. While these have the advantage of being very easy to administer and analyze, one significant disadvantage is that they are self-reported and thus assess perceptions instead of demonstrated skills. For this study, we have developed a coding protocol to qualitatively evaluate written artifacts produced by first-year engineering students as part of their semester design project. The coding protocol identifies the classification, appropriateness, and documentation of individual sources used. The protocol also identifies overall strengths and weaknesses in regard to efficacy of information gathering, use of evidence to support arguments, and documentation of information sources across the artifact as a whole.

40|$|This essay {{reflects}} {{upon the}} behavior of prepositions “of, in, to”, in the “minutes genre”, written in Spanish, trying to place them according to the basic directions (origin, aim, and content) and spatial axes (horizontal and container/content) proposed by Castilho (2004). It is a bibliographical and documental research, {{whose objective is to}} verify if this supposed principle {{can be applied to the}} Spanish language and to check if the meanings of prepositions, revealed in the minute’s genre, correspond to those described by grammar currently used in teaching Spanish in a Secretarial course. For this purpose, we used the theoretical support for the study of prepositions in Spanish assumptions of Llorach Alarcos (1999), Martin Cid (2002), Vigon Artos (2007) and Araus (1987) and the functionalist assumptions of Castilho (2004), Neves (2000, 2001, 2007), and Cunha (2008). We selected the “minutes genre” as an object of study for considering such genre as an <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> and a reference for Spanish to Secretarial course.

40|$|A figura de Sócrates sempre encantou e confundiu aqueles que se propuseram a escrever sobre o filósofo grego. Além da grande contribuição filosófica sobre os mais variados assuntos, ele também é apresentado de formas diversas e até convergentes por seus testemunhos. Propomos traçar a personagem de Sócrates através de duas obras específicas: O Banquete de Platão e As Nuvens de Aristófanes. Assim, procuraremos compreender e reconhecer aquilo que foi dito de Sócrates, tanto as características que se aproximam quanto as que se distanciam, através de uma de suas características mais marcantes: a feiura socrática. Baseados na aparência do filósofo, buscaremos analisar como que sua filosofia e sua vida se confundiam, e como estas eram percebidas pela polis. Da mesma forma que a ironia é expressa pelo contrário do que se pensa, Sócrates revelava-se pelo avesso de sua essência. Sua feiura, então, assume o papel de autêntica ferramenta irônica. Para auxiliar a busca da personagem socrática através de sua aparência três outras características fundamentais de sua filosofia serão analisadas: a ironia, as máscaras socráticas e a dialética. ______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe {{figure of}} Socrates has always enchanted and {{confused}} {{those who have}} proposed {{to write about the}} Greek philosophers. We can't not only with his great philosophical contributions on the most varied subjects but he was also presented in many different ways, even convergent in his witness/testimony.

In this way, we seek to understand and recognize what was said about Socrates, the closes characteristics as well as thos which were quite distant, through one of his most remarkable / outstanding characteristics: the Socratic ugliness. Based on the apperance of the philosopher, we seek to show his philosophy and his life were as one and how these could be observed in Polis. In {{the same way that the}} irony is expressed by the contrary of what is thought, Socrates revealed himself by the opposite of his essence.

40|$|Introduction Testament is a solemn, <b>authentic</b> <b>instrument</b> in writing, {{by which}} a person {{declares}} his or her will as to disposal {{of his or her}} estate, and it has a psychopathological, lawful and ethical importance to a person, family and society. The aim {{of the study was to}} assess if the ability to make a testament was more damaged in patients with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) than in patients with other diseases that resulted in Chronic Renal Failure in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the period from the 1 st January 2001 to 31 st December 2006. Material and methods The 753 respondents were divided into two groups in the study: BEN group (n= 150) and control group made of patients with other diseases resulting in CRF (n= 150). In a multicentric longitudinal study we used: adapted questionnaire from the Renal Register of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination. Descriptive analysis, discriminative function and regression model have been done statistically. Results In BEN group, heirs are mostly mentioned - 84. 0 % (t= 14. 391; P= 0. 001), and in control group: heirs - 66. 6 %, relatives - 43. 3 % (t= 7. 751; P= 0. 003), carers - 44. 0 % (t= 6. 678 P= 0. 032), and institutions 10. 0 % (t= 5. 147, P= 0. 061). The discriminative function shows differences between BEN and control group: canonical correlation (rc) = 0. 827, Wilkinson lambda (lnj) = 0. 871, Chi-square test = 141. 575 and significance (P= 0. 001). The regression course of the analysis can be used for prediction of the ability to make testament for the patients on dialysis: [y=- 0. 95 x + 15. 715, and OR = 0. 785, (95 %) for CI = - 0. 997 - - 0. 375); Can Fanc r 2 = 0. 861; Significance is P= 0. 002]. Conclusion The ability to make a testament is more damaged in patients from the nephropathy group than in the patients from the control group who are on dialysis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This has been confirmed by socio-demographic and psychological parameters, and it is very important for preservation of the ethic norms of the patients on dialysis, responsibility of the expert teams and persons who are benefitiaries of the testament...|$|E

The third and most extensive part of the paper carefully studies documental proof: in the first place, in order to distinguish it from all other types af Prof. which, even though they be presented as documental proof, are not actually such, since this process must be initiated with a preconstituted documental Prof. (and this proof must be representative of the allegad caput nullitatis;) secondly, 'in order to establish a common and broad concept of the «certalnand authenticinstrument (a concept broad enough to inelude both public and private instruments).

Finally, the author studies the need for consistency in the «certain and authentic- instrument, pointing out the difference of this necessity at the Initiation of the proceedlngs from its importance at the moment when the Ordinary must make a declsion.
