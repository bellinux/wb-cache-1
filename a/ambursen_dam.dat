There is an inflatable section {{on top of the}} dam that can slightly increase its size when so desired. The lock side of the facility has a large observation area that is open from April to November each year. A bridge allows visitors to walk over the two locks and right up next to the dam.|$|E

The company sued to preserve its patents fairly aggressively but with mixed success. [...] In some cases, the <b>Ambursen</b> <b>dam</b> became a more generic [...] "Ambursen type", for instance at the 1911 Lock and Dam No. 1 on the Upper Mississippi River between Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota. Civil engineer George Freeman received his own November 1912 patent on {{a modified version of}} the concrete buttress dam used there.|$|E
