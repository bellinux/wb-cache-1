5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships <b>and</b> <b>missiles,</b> spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a black market offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the black market will be terminated.|$|E

5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by anti-missile systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E
5|$|Hughes Aircraft would {{continue}} {{the development of}} the advanced fire control system and the GAR-9 missile.

The final configuration for the rear cockpit in the YF-12A looked {{similar to that of the}} F-108 since it incorporated the same displays and controls required for the Hughes AN/ASG-18 fire control system.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the perceived threat, the U.S. Atlantic Fleet prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> This plan was originally code-named 'Operation Bumblebee', and later renamed 'Operation Teardrop'. Completed on 6 January 1945, the plan involved U.S.Navy anti-submarine forces as well as United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Army units, which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces {{to operate in the}} mid-Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast. These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups, and used Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, as their forward operating base. As well as guarding against missile attacks, these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high-performance Type XXI submarines if they began operating in the central Atlantic. The AtlanticFleet's commander, Vice Admiral Jonas H. Ingram, gave a press conference on 8 January in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers.|$|E

Aircraft dropped 318 precision bombs, launched 391 rockets <b>and</b> <b>missiles,</b> and fired 93,000 machine gun or cannon rounds on the city, while artillery units fired 5,685 rounds of 155 mm shells. The Red Cross estimated that 250,000 out of 300,000 residents had left the city during the fighting. A Baghdad Red Cross official unofficially estimated that up to 800 civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{contacted}} the Johns Hopkins University Operations Research Office (ORO) {{to consider the}} task of shooting down ballistic missiles using a Nike-like system. The ORO report took three years to complete, and the resulting The Defense of the United States Against Aircraft <b>and</b> <b>Missiles</b> was comprehensive. While this study was still progressing, in February 1955 the Army began initial talks with Bell, and in March they contracted Bell's Nike team to begin a detailed 18-month study of the problem under the name Nike II.|$|E
5|$|The Phantom {{represented}} {{a significant improvement}} to the RAAF's ground attack capabilities. The F-4Es were more technologically advanced than the Canberra, as they could fly at supersonic speeds, were equipped with air-to-air radar <b>and</b> <b>missiles,</b> and had an inertial navigation system, ground-attack computer and a cannon. The Phantoms were capable of operating in several roles; the RAAF primarily used them as strike aircraft. This role was selected to prepare aircrew to operate F-111s, and most training exercises were focused on tasks that the F-111s would {{also be able to}} perform.|$|E

5|$|Fragile Allegiance is {{essentially}} a remake of Gremlin Interactive's 1994 Amiga game K240, with the graphics and user interface revamped for the improved PC hardware available at the time. The core gameplay elements of K240 are retained; the game is set in an asteroid belt, the Sci-Tek blueprint system replaces research and the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation. Many of the buildings, ships <b>and</b> <b>missiles</b> have the same names and functions as those in K240 and in both games there are six alien races competing against the player. The soundtrack for the game was composed by Patrick Phelan who also composed the soundtrack for K240. The game was released in 1996 and competed against other empire building titles such as Ascendancy and Master of Orion 2.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, an {{agreement}} to implement the Vance plan designed to stop the fighting was made by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN. Ending the series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. A stalemate developed as the conflict evolved into static trench warfare, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK, {{but a series of}} HV advances restored small areas to Croatian control as the siege of Dubrovnik ended, and Operation Maslenica resulted in minor tactical gains. In response to the HV successes, the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina (ARSK) intermittently attacked a number of Croat towns and villages with artillery <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since {{conducting}} {{nuclear tests}} in 1998, both India and Pakistan {{have decided to}} build a “minimum nuclear deterrence”, replacing the policy of “non-weaponized nuclear deterrence”, followed since 1970 s. Both countries appear to have accelerated their nuclear <b>and</b> <b>missile</b> programmes, particularly since 2001, while the international attention has been focused elsewhere such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Free from intensive international scrutiny, India and Pakistan continued to develop, test and deploy different types of ballistic <b>missiles.</b> The nuclear <b>and</b> <b>missile</b> developments in South Asia are gaining greater momentum rather than slowing down and India and Pakistan {{appear to be in}} danger of being trapped into a costly strategic arms race. This paper discusses various nuclear <b>and</b> <b>missile</b> developments in India and Pakistan and their technological capabilities.

An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies <b>and</b> <b>missiles</b> on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a 360-degree coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
5|$|The Menzies {{government}} first publicly {{discussed the}} need for replacing the English Electric Canberra in 1954, only {{a year after the}} RAAF began receiving the bomber. The non-supersonic Canberra lacked radar and electronic countermeasures, all disadvantages based on Korean War experience. The RAAF believed that it needed a new strategic bomber to fulfill the nation's obligations to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia, ANZUS, and SEATO. Air Staff Requirement 36 that year mandated an all-weather attack aircraft by 1959 capable of delivering a variety of bombs <b>and</b> <b>missiles.</b> A study recommended one of the British V bombers, but Prime Minister Robert Menzies' Minister of Defence Frederick Shedden decided in 1956 that at £1million each they were too expensive.|$|E
