500|$|These {{concepts}} {{shaped the}} Mercury Control Center, which was located at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Another important concept pioneered by Kraft {{was the idea}} of the flight director, the man who would coordinate the team of engineers and make real-time decisions about the conduct of the mission. As Mathews later recalled, Kraft came to him one day saying, [...] "There needs to be someone in charge of the flights while they're actually going on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that person." [...] In this informal way, the position of flight director was born.|$|E

On re-signing, Hunt stated, [...] "I look around and see guys like Webbie and Locky who have been here for their entire careers, and it's something I would like to do. If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes out on the field every week.

500|$|Orr was {{noticed by}} the Boston Bruins {{in the spring}} of 1961, playing in a youth hockey tournament in Gananoque, Ontario. The Bruins' Wren Blair {{described}} him as [...] "a combination of Doug Harvey and Eddie Shore." [...] The Bruins immediately pursued Orr. Blair made regular visits to the family home. In the fall of 1961, the Bruins invested C$1,000 (C$ in [...] dollars) to sponsor his minor hockey team. Although three other NHL teams (Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings and Montreal Canadiens) were interested in Orr, he signed in 1962 with the Bruins. Orr explained that he signed with the Bruins because [...] "they're a team of the future. They're rebuilding <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of that building program." ...|$|E

[...] "A Place in the Dirt" [...] is another personal song, characterized by Adam's self-analysis of his place in Holy Wood.

The verse [...] "Today I am dirty <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pretty, tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt" [...] has an Iggy Pop-style vocal delivery, building to the adrenaline-fueled chorus. CMJ noted that the song {{could be interpreted as}} a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children's blood. [...] "The Death Song" [...] is the turning point for Adam; he no longer cares. Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic: [...] "it's like 'We have no future and we don't give a fuck'." [...] Kerrang! described it as one of the album's heaviest songs.|$|E

500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus– I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins– I love her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to intercede with God for them, and finally possess her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, [...] "Give us also the right to our existence".|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{returned}} to his parent club ahead of the 2010–11 season, with Peterborough plying their trade in League One following the club's relegation from the Championship the previous season. In July 2010 {{it was announced that}} Boyd had agreed a new three–year contract with Peterborough. On agreeing the new contract, Boyd said [...] "I firmly believe this club is going places <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of that". He scored in Peterborough's first match of the 2010–11 season, a 3–0 win against Bristol Rovers. He scored his second goal of the season in the club's following match, netting Peterborough's second in a 4–1 League Cup first round victory against Rotherham United. Boyd scored his third goal in four matches in the club's win against Huddersfield Town, as Peterborough came from two goals down to win 4–2. Three days later, Boyd scored the winner in Peterborough's 2–1 League Cup win against Cardiff City, as well as providing the assist for the first goal. He scored his fifth goal of the season in a 5–2 win against Oldham Athletic, scoring Peterborough's third as the club came from two goals down to record three points.|$|E

His contract, however, contained a release clause from the club, triggered by a fixed transfer fee of at least €37 million.

She works hard and it's cool to write for someone who is so open-minded." [...] On August 21, American songwriter Claude Kelly revealed {{that he had been}} writing songs for Rihanna while she was performing in London. Kelly spoke on the songs that he had written for Rihanna saying; [...] "Rihanna's a worldwide superstar at this point and she's performing in stadiums and arenas now, so I wanted songs that reflected her audience, when I was in London she was performing at a festival in front of like 30,000 to 40,000 people. So I didn't want small songs that only worked on radio, so I tried to do anthemic big stadium-themed songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guiteau put {{his pistol}} {{back in his}} pocket and turned to leave via a cab that he had waiting for him outside the station, but {{collided}} with policeman Patrick Kearney, who was entering the station after hearing the gunfire. Kearney apprehended Guiteau. He was so excited at having arrested the man who had presumably shot Garfield that he neglected to take Guiteau's gun from him until after their arrival at the police station. Kearney demanded, [...] "In God's name, what did you shoot the president for?" [...] Guiteau did not respond. The rapidly gathering crowd screamed, [...] "Lynch him!", but Kearney and several other police officers took the assassin to the police station a few blocks away. As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau uttered the exulting words, repeated everywhere: [...] "'I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts! I did it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> arrested! Arthur is President now!'" [...] This statement briefly led to unfounded suspicions that either Arthur or his supporters had put Guiteau up to the crime. The Stalwarts were a Republican faction loyal to former President Grant; they strongly opposed Garfield's Half-Breeds. Like many other vice presidents, Chester A. Arthur had been selected as a running mate for political advantage — to placate his faction rather than for his skills or loyalty. Guiteau, in his delusion, had convinced himself that he was striking a blow to unite the two factions of the Republican Party.|$|E
2500|$|Charlotte de Sauve {{has been}} {{credited}} {{as a source}} of the information that led to the execution of Marguerite de Valois's lover Joseph Boniface de La Môle and Annibal de Coconnas for engaging in a conspiracy to overthrow the gravely ill Charles IX and the Queen Mother in 1574 with the assistance of Huguenot troops. In 1575, Catherine de' Medici, abetted by her son Henry III, instructed Charlotte to seduce the king's brother, her youngest son, François, Duke of Alençon, with the aim of provoking hostility between the two young men, so that they would not conspire together in the future. Charlotte subsequently became the duke's mistress, creating a rift between the former close friends, as Navarre and Alençon became rivals over Charlotte. According to Marguerite's memoirs: [...] "Charlotte de Sauve treated both of them [...] {{in such a way that}} they became extremely jealous of each other, to such a point that they forgot their ambitions, their duties and their plans and thought of nothing but chasing after this woman". Henry of Navarre wrote to a friend: [...] "The court is the strangest I have ever known. We are nearly always ready to cut each other's throat ... All the band you know wants my death on account of my love for Monsieur [...] and they have forbidden for the third time my mistress [...] to speak to me. They have such a hold on her that she does not dare look at me. I am waiting for a minor battle, for they say they will kill me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one jump ahead of them". On one occasion, Henry III had Alençon's papers searched for evidence of political plotting but turned up only a declaration of love from Madame de Sauve.|$|E
