50|$|Commuted {{cash value}} {{refers to the}} present value of an annuity after annuitization.

5000|$|The {{benefits}} of a longevity annuity are even greater since 2014, when the U.S. Treasury Departmeni issued a new rule allowing {{the purchase of a}} Qualifying Longevity <b>Annuity</b> <b>Contract</b> (QLAC), also known as Qualified Longevity <b>Annuity</b> <b>Contract,</b> within an IRA or an employer tax-qualified retirement plan, without having to include the value of the annuity in the annual required minimum distribution (RMD) at age 70 1/2, which is taxable as ordinary income. That effectively reduces the amount of the IRA or employer plan subject to the required distribution, resulting in a tax saving every year until the payments eventually begin. Once the payments begin, the QLAC payout automatically meets any RMD requirements for the payout amount. (These payments are then also taxed as ordinary income.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cash value}} of an {{insurance}} contract, also called the cash surrender value or surrender value, is the cash amount offered to the policyowner by the issuing life carrier upon cancellation of the contract.

50|$|<b>Annuity</b> <b>contracts</b> in the United States {{are defined}} by the Internal Revenue Code and {{regulated}} by the individual states. Variable annuities have features of both life insurance and investment products. In the U.S., annuity insurance may be issued only by life insurance companies, although private <b>annuity</b> <b>contracts</b> may be arranged between donors to non-profits to reduce taxes. Insurance companies are regulated by the states, so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others. Their federal tax treatment, however, is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. Variable annuities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms {{doing business in the}} United States).|$|R

5000|$|An {{individual}} retirement account or IRA {{is a form of}} [...] "{{individual retirement}} plan", provided by many financial institutions, that provides tax advantages for retirement savings in the United States. An {{individual retirement account}} is a type of [...] "individual retirement arrangement" [...] as described in IRS Publication 590, individual retirement arrangements (IRAs). The term IRA, used to describe both individual retirement accounts and the broader category of individual retirement arrangements, encompasses an individual retirement account; a trust or custodial account set up for the exclusive benefit of taxpayers or their beneficiaries; and an individual retirement annuity, by which the taxpayers purchase an <b>annuity</b> <b>contract</b> or an endowment contract from a life insurance company.|$|E
50|$|The {{insurance}} company is legally obligated {{to make the}} payments stipulated in the longevity <b>annuity</b> <b>contract,</b> but this obligation might not be enforceable if the company goes into bankruptcy. Therefore, prospective purchasers are generally advised to investigate the financial strength of the issuer before buying longevity insurance, and to consider splitting whatever amount they have earmarked for this purpose among several different contracts from different companies, so that if one goes bankrupt they will still have income from the others. In the United States, states generally require insurance companies {{to be members of}} state guaranty associations, which would very likely pay at least some portion of the benefits promised if the {{insurance company}} went bankrupt.|$|E
50|$|A {{pensioner}} {{who buys}} an annuity hands over a capital sum and, in return, {{the insurance company}} pays the pensioner an amount stipulated under the <b>annuity</b> <b>contract</b> based on their life expectancy and the assumed returns on an underlying investment. The contract is guaranteed by the insurer for life {{on the assumption that}} those living longest will receive the cross-subsidy of those who die earlier. The income may be guaranteed or based on investments that may affect the future level of income. Guaranteed contracts are loosely based on the current fifteen year Gilt rate (gilts being the bonds issued by the UK government. A prospective pensioner in ill-health may be able to buy an impaired life annuity that assumes a shorter life expectancy and would provide a greater level of payment than a standard annuity.|$|E
