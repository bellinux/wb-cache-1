5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} in captivity, men from the 2/18th {{undertook}} a number of subversive activities including building a radio transmitter, which they used to contact local resistance groups who provided them with assistance {{in the form of}} medicine and intelligence. They were also involved in numerous escape attempts, some of which were successful, alongside Australians from other units. One of these successful escapes involved a group of eight men who escaped from the camp on Berhala Island in two groups. One group escaped while out of camp on a work detail, while the other simply walked out the front gate to use the ablutions <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> After meeting up outside the camp, the men split up again. One group included Lieutenant Charles Wagner, who had previously been decorated with the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions around the Nithsdale Estate and who had been commissioned in the field. Having bribed one of the camp guards, Wagner's group had contacted the local guerillas and arranged to rendezvous with a fishing vessel. After hiding out for three weeks, the vessel eventually arrived offshore and took them on board. The group then met up with the other escapees on Tawi-Tawi where in mid-1943 they began working with the Filipino guerilla forces, fighting alongside them {{until the end of the}} war. Other escapes occurred later in the war, including one in which five men escaped from Ranau over the course of two days in early July 1945 during one of the death marches. After effecting their escape, these men were helped by locals who provided food and information, before the men were able to meet up with some Australians from Z Special Unit.|$|E

25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her {{what she would do}} if Leslie went away <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
25|$|Through bribes and threats, he {{eventually}} {{managed to get}} a permission to go to Slovenia for himself and twenty close companions. From there the group moved through Austria and Germany before finally relocating to Li√®ge, Belgium. Although Prazina settled himself and his followers in a neighborhood populated mostly by immigrants from Turkey and the Maghreb, {{he eventually}} established himself among the city's small Yugoslav emigrant community. There, Prazina was last seen the night of 3 December 1993. He went out with his bodyguards after a game of cards <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The next morning, German police found his Audi abandoned at the railroad station in Aachen. The car body had two bullet holes from a 9mm handgun; presumed to be a Beretta. Prazina's body was discovered in a canal alongside a highway near the German border by two Romanian hitch-hikers on New Year's Eve. The bullets found in Prazina's head corresponded to the holes in his car, and the ownership of a Beretta by one of his bodyguards sealed the case in the eyes of Belgian police. The four bodyguards were arrested, and three of them went on to be tried and sentenced to serve time in prison.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on Parker and Stone's {{elaborate}} April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of Newsday {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> The lesson: Pay off our expectations, or you'll be sorry." [...] Jim Minge of the Omaha World-Herald said South Park fans were [...] "duped" [...] by the episode. Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care if you like it or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E

Treated [...] "like a slave," [...] by her in-laws, Hirono said, in 1951 Laura left her abusive marriage. The deciding moment for her had come after Akira, who had returned to Hawaii after the war, had sent some money for a school uniform for Laura's youngest son Wayne, but her husband had taken it to buy an overcoat. As Laura later recounted, [...] "My brother sent {{money to buy a}} school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn't need an overcoat in the spring. That's when I made up my mind to leave." [...] After telling her in-laws she would be taking her elder son and Hirono to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes for the rail fare, she returned to her parents' house. Laura said, [...] "My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Yos√© {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah {{said that}} {{after the death of}} Moses (reported in [...] and [...] ), the pillar of cloud, the manna, and the well ceased. Rabbi Yos√© the son of Rabbi Judah taught that when the Israelites left Egypt, Providence {{appointed}} three good providers for them: Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. On their account, Providence gave the Israelites three gifts: the pillar of cloud of the Divine Glory, manna, and the well that followed them throughout their sojourns. Providence provided the well through the merit of Miriam, the pillar of cloud through the merit of Aaron, and the manna through the merit of Moses. When Miriam died, the well ceased, but it came back through the merit of Moses and Aaron. When Aaron died, the pillar of cloud ceased, but both of them came back through the merit of Moses. When Moses died, all three of them came to an end <b>and</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> as [...] says, [...] "In one month, I destroyed the three shepherds." [...] Similarly, Rabbi Simon taught that wherever it says, [...] "And it came to pass after," [...] the world relapsed into its former state. Thus, [...] says: [...] "Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord," [...] and immediately thereafter, the well, the manna, and the clouds of glory ceased.|$|E

60|$|Some {{years before}} Stephen Petter had decided upon his vocation, a rich gentleman had built himself a country-seat {{about two miles}} out of Lethbury.
