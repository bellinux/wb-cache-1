5|$|In January 2014, the Benadir {{administration}} {{launched a}} citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it {{is a joint}} initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. The project {{is part of the}} ongoing modernization and development of the capital. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate vehicle access in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah'ow, the reconstruction initiative will <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> journey. The first apparent {{contact between}} the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it {{was assumed to be}} public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It has been suggested that the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E

5|$|The Aire and Calder still fulfils its {{original}} purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly. More recent canals now <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Navigation a vital {{link in the}} English and Welsh connected inland waterway network. Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which connects to the Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal connects to the Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea. The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, which {{can be reached via}} the New Junction Canal, forms a link with Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield to the south west, and the tidal River Trent at Keadby to the east.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E

25|$|The {{draft was}} held on June 9–11, 2016, at Secaucus, New Jersey. Day one of the MLB Draft {{included}} the first 77 overall selections. The Cardinals, {{in addition to their}} trio of first-round picks, will <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> 70th overall selection that day. Because they posted MLB's best record in 2015, the Cardinals receive the last pick in each subsequent round. Rounds 3–10 will be held on June 10, followed by rounds 11–40 a day later. The Cardinals have not yet announced who they will send to Secaucus to serve as their on-site representative for the event's first day.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the NFL added its 32nd team, the Houston Texans, and {{significantly}} reshuffled its divisional alignment. The league went from 6 division winners and 6 wild card spots to 8 division winners and only 4 wild card qualifiers. The winners of each division automatically earn {{a playoff spot}} and a home game in their first rounds, and the two top non-division winners from each conference will <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> playoffs as wild-card teams. The top two teams with the best records {{in the regular season}} get a first round bye, and each of the bottom two division winners plays one of the two wild-card teams. Each winner of a wild-card game then plays one of the two bye teams. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference championship games then face each other in the Super Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{intensified}} {{clashes between}} the CPC and KMT, {{countries such as}} the US and the Soviet Union attempted to prevent a disastrous civil war. After the New Fourth Army incident, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent special envoy Lauchlin Currie to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that {{the only ones to}} benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece China's Destiny, which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.|$|E

25|$|A {{previous}} negative social {{experience can}} be a trigger to social phobia, perhaps particularly for individuals high in 'interpersonal sensitivity'. For around half of those diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, a specific traumatic or humiliating social event appears {{to be associated with}} the onset or worsening of the disorder; this kind of event appears to be particularly related to specific (performance) social phobia, for example regarding public speaking (Stemberg et al., 1995). As well as direct experiences, observing or hearing about the socially negative experiences of others (e.g. a faux pas committed by someone), or verbal warnings of social problems and dangers, may <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> development of a social anxiety disorder more likely. Social anxiety disorder may be caused by the longer-term effects of not fitting in, or being bullied, rejected or ignored (Beidel and Turner, 1998). Shy adolescents or avoidant adults have emphasised unpleasant experiences with peers or childhood bullying or harassment (Gilmartin, 1987). In one study, popularity was found to be negatively correlated with social anxiety, and children who were neglected by their peers reported higher social anxiety and fear of negative evaluation than other categories of children. Socially phobic children appear less likely to receive positive reactions from peers and anxious or inhibited children may isolate themselves.|$|E
500|$|The scenes where Dwight {{climbs into}} a box almost {{did not make the}} episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight {{climbing}} into the box would not only make the episode [...] "crazy broad," [...] but <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as [...] "the most natural thing in the world." [...] Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his [...] "action hero" [...] moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien.|$|E
500|$|The {{ornament}} of the chitinozoans may cast {{light on}} the question. Whilst in some cases a defensive role - by making the vessel larger, and thus less digestible by would-be predators - seems probable, it is not impossible that the protrusions may have anchored the organisms to the sea floor. However, their low-density construction makes this unlikely: perhaps more plausible is that they acted to attach to other organisms. Longer spines <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> organisms more buoyant, by decreasing their Rayleigh number (i.e. increasing {{the relative importance of}} water's viscosity) — it is therefore possible that at least the long-spined chitinozoans were planktonic [...] "floaters". On the other hand, the walls of some chitinozoans were probably too thick and dense to allow them to float.|$|E
