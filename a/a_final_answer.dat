The proposal was withdrawn after it had generated controversy.|$|E
500|$|From 2008 to 2010, {{time limits}} {{were used for}} each question. Contestants were given up to 15 seconds each for {{questions}} one through five, 30 seconds each for questions six through ten, and 45 seconds each for questions eleven through fourteen. Unused time was banked, and if the contestant reached question fifteen, {{he or she was}} given 45 seconds plus the amount of time previously banked. If the clock reached zero before a contestant could provide <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>answer,</b> the contestant was forced to walk away with the winnings they had at that point. During the clock format era, a [...] "Millionaire Menu" [...] was introduced, in which categories are revealed for each question {{at the beginning of the}} game, and are made visible to the contestant for their future reference. Some prize levels also changed at the start of season eight. Most of the episodes in season eight (from the [...] "Million Dollar Tournament of Ten" [...] onward) featured special [...] "Celebrity Questions" [...] that were mid-level in monetary value, and were provided by notable individuals whose identities were not revealed until the contestant reached their special questions.|$|E
500|$|During {{the shuffle}} format era, the show {{introduced}} a new lifeline, [...] "Jump the Question", which {{was able to be}} used twice in a single game for seasons nine through twelve. At any point prior to selecting <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>answer,</b> a contestant could use Jump the Question to skip the current question and {{move on to the next}} one, thus reducing the number of questions they had to correctly answer. However, if the contestant used Jump the Question, they did not gain any money from the question they chose to skip (for example, a contestant would not gain the typical $100,000 if they jumped to the $250,000 question). This lifeline could not be used on the $1 million question, since it is the final question in the game. The [...] "Plus One" [...] lifeline, introduced in season thirteen, allows a contestant to bring a companion with him or her to the podium for help in answering a question. The introduction of this lifeline reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one. On occasional specially designated weeks, starting with a Halloween-themed week that aired from October 29 to November 2, 2012, the shuffle format used a special lifeline called [...] "Crystal Ball", which allows the contestant to see the money value of a round one question prior to giving an answer. Jump the Question was removed at the end of the show's thirteenth syndicated season. For the show's fourteenth season, during a special week of college shows, players got another lifeline called [...] "Extra Help", played similarly to [...] "Plus One" [...] and allowing for another companion to help the player; however, it could only be used after [...] "Plus One" [...] was used.|$|E

Almost all coordinate conditions used by physicists, including the harmonic and synchronous coordinate conditions, would be satisfied by a metric tensor that equals the Minkowski tensor everywhere. (However, since the Riemann {{and hence the}} Ricci tensor for Minkowski coordinates is identically zero, the Einstein equations give zero energy/matter for Minkowski coordinates; so Minkowski coordinates cannot be <b>an</b> acceptable <b>final</b> <b>answer.)</b> Unlike the harmonic and synchronous coordinate conditions, some commonly used coordinate conditions may be either under-determinative or over-determinative.|$|R

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} problem picture left the details of the {{narrative}} action deliberately ambiguous, inviting the viewer to speculate on it using the evidence in front of them, but not supplying <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> (artists learned to smile enigmatically when asked).

2500|$|Main game contestants {{are asked}} {{increasingly}} difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Questions are multiple choice: four possible answers are given (labelled A, B, C and D), and the contestant must choose the correct one. The 'D' answer {{on the first}} question (except in the Shuffle format like in the US version) is always incorrect and humorous. Upon answering a question correctly, the contestant wins {{a certain amount of}} money. In most versions, there is no time limit to answer a question; a contestant may (and often does) take as long as they need to ponder an answer. After the first few questions, the host will ask the contestant if that is their [...] "final answer". When a contestant says [...] "final" [...] in conjunction with one of the answers, it is official, and cannot be changed. The first five questions usually omit this rule, because the questions are generally so easy that requiring <b>a</b> <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> would significantly slow the game down; thus, there are five chances for the contestant to leave with no money if they were to provide a wrong answer before obtaining the first guaranteed amount; going for 1,000 units of currency after winning 500 units is the last point in the game at which a contestant can still leave empty-handed.|$|E
40|$|In {{many of the}} {{problems}} that can be found nowadays, information is scattered across different heterogeneous data sources. Most of the natural language interfaces just focus on a very specific part of the problem (e. g. an interface to a relational database, or an interface to an ontology). However, {{from the point of view}} of users, it does not matter where the information is stored, they just want to get the knowledge in an integrated, transparent, efficient, effective, and pleasant way. To solve this problem, this article proposes a generic multi-agent conversational architecture that follows the divide and conquer philosophy and considers two different types of agents. Expert agents are specialized in accessing different knowledge sources, and decision agents coordinate them to provide <b>a</b> coherent <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> to the user. This architecture has been used to design and implement SmartSeller, a specific system which includes a Virtual Assistant to answer general questions and a Bookseller to query a book database. A deep analysis regarding other relevant systems has demonstrated that our proposal provides several improvements at some key features presented along the paper...|$|R
5000|$|Ken Levine, the {{creative}} {{lead of the}} game, stated that players are supposed to draw their own conclusions from the game, and ultimately decide [...] "what is good and bad." [...] He explained that [...] "there are many parts of Infinite that are open to interpretation, and the purpose is that you draw your own theories from them." [...] To this end, Levine avoided providing <b>an</b> authoritative <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> regarding the game's ending, replying [...] "What actually matters is what people think. Why does my interpretation matter more than yours?" [...] Acknowledging that Infinites themes left fans debating and frustrated, Levine was nevertheless satisfied by the game's opacity, stating {{that it was his}} intent, and compared the game's interpretation of quantum mechanics to some of his favorite films; 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fight Club, The Master, Miller's Crossing, and There Will Be Blood. Rob Crossley of CVG stated that [...] "To Levine, the game's Many Worlds Theory is a storytelling device; one that gives his narrative something unique in games yet celebrated in film: interpretability.|$|R

A system object coordinates {{a collection of}} processing objects into a pipe that constructs a set of queries, retrieves passage, and then processes those passages into <b>a</b> <b>final</b> output <b>answer</b> set. Using the framework we applied multiple levels of synonym expansion and a ranked series of topic queries {{with a range of}} specificities in order to retrieve all of the likely relevant passages with the most likely ranked higher. We then applied sentence pruning to the head and tail of each passage using both NLP and term-based techniques. Overall scores finished around the TREC Genomics mean {{for each of the four}} measures. Careful passage retrieval, including synonym expansion and multiple query construction, as well as sentence pruning was essential in achieving acceptable performance on this task...|$|R

However, if the contestant uses Jump the Question, they do not gain any money from the question they choose to skip (for example, a contestant with a bank of $68,100 may jump the $100,000 question, but will still have only $68,100 instead of the typical $100,000 when they face the $250,000 question). Unlike other lifelines throughout the show's history, this lifeline cannot be used on the $1 million question, since it is the final question in the game. The introduction of Plus One reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one. On occasional specially designated weeks, starting with a Halloween-themed week that aired from 29 October to 2 November 2012, the shuffle format uses a special lifeline called [...] "Crystal Ball", which allows the contestant to see the money value of a round one question prior to giving an answer.

Yet the issues raised by cloning are, for several reasons, affecting mankind in general and therefore cannot be solved by representatives and opinion leaders predominantly from the so-called 'West' only. Among these reasons is the fundamental question of whether our concepts of 'man', 'personhood', and consequently 'mankind' have to be reformulated in the light of recent scientific progress.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{boundaries}} of the recent result that eliciting more than one estimate from the same person and averaging these can lead to accuracy gains in judgment tasks. It first examines its generality, analysing whether the kind of question being asked has an effect on the size of potential gains. Experimental results show that the question type matters. Previous results reporting potential accuracy gains are reproduced for year-estimation questions, and extended to questions about percentage shares. On the other hand, no gains are found for general numerical questions. The second part of the paper tests repeated judgment sampling’s practical applicability by asking judges to provide <b>a</b> third and <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> {{on the basis of their}} first two estimates. In an experiment, the majority of judges do not consistently average their first two answers. As a result, they do not realise the potential accuracy gains from averaging...|$|R
60|$|Although these {{suggestions}} {{did not prevent}} the signing away of Malta at the peace of Amiens, they doubtless were not without effect, when the ambition of Buonaparte had given <b>a</b> full and <b>final</b> <b>answer</b> to the grand question: can we remain at peace with France? I have likewise {{reason to believe that}} Sir Alexander Ball, baffled, by exposing an insidious proposal of the French Government, during the negotiations that preceded the recommencement of the war--that the fortifications of Malta should be entirely dismantled, and the island left to its inhabitants. Without dwelling on the obvious inhumanity and flagitious injustice of exposing the Maltese to certain pillage and slavery from their old and inveterate enemies, the Moors, he showed that the plan would promote the interests of Buonaparte even more than his actual possession of the island, which France had no possible interest in desiring, except as the means of keeping it {{out of the hands of}} Great Britain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether people}} benefit more from playing a commercial off-the-shelf game in pairs {{rather than in}} solitary mode. The basic idea behind this didactic method {{is that there is}} a serious risk that solitary game play yields insufficient articulation and explanation for learning to take place. Participants in the experimental condition played a strategy game in collaborative mode (pairs). Solitary play formed the control condition. During game play data were gathered about engagement (ie, flow). Also, the dialogues of the pairs were recorded. After game completion participants individually completed a knowledge test. For solitary players this ended the session. Collaborating pairs could discuss test answers (without receiving experimenter feedback) and give <b>a</b> <b>final</b> group <b>answer.</b> Collaboration was found not to affect game engagement and also did not affect individual knowledge test scores. The collaboration presumably did not advance the players' individual knowledge because the game dialogues mainly dealt with superficial game features such as move proposals. The collaborating players benefitted significantly from the opportunity to discuss test scores. The discussion revolves around game selection and game didactics (including scripted collaboration and debriefing) as routes for future studies to follow in ways of improving game utilisation in school...|$|R
