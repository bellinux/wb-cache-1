40|$|Abstract. Swarm-based {{systems are}} {{a class of}} multi-agent systems (MAS) of {{particular}} interest because they exhibit emergent behaviour through self-organisation. They are biology-inspired but find themselves applicable {{to a wide range}} of domains, with some of them characterised as mission critical. It is therefore implied that the use of a formal framework and methods would facilitate modelling of a MAS in such a way that the final product is fully tested and safety properties are verified. In this paper, we present OPERAS, an open framework that facilitates formal modelling of MAS. We describe how a particular instance of this framework, namely OPERASXC, could employ existing formal methods and integrate the most prominent characteristics of finite state machines and biological computation systems, such as X-machines and P Systems respectively. We demonstrate how the resulting method can be used to formally model a swarm-based system of <b>autonomous</b> <b>spacecrafts</b> and discuss the flexibility and advantages of this approach. ...|$|R

The use of GNSS in MEO, GEO, HEO, and highly elliptical orbits is feasible only if the receiver can acquire and track the much weaker (15 - 20 dB) GNSS side-lobe signals. This design constraint, and the radiation environment found in space, prevents the use of COTS receivers.

40|$|This work {{introduces}} theoretical {{developments and}} experimental verification for Guidance, Navigation, and Control of <b>autonomous</b> multiple <b>spacecraft</b> assembly. We here address the in-plane orbital assembly case, where two translational and one rotational {{degrees of freedom}} are considered. Each spacecraft involved in the assembly is both chaser and target at the same time. The guidance and control strategies are LQR-based, designed {{to take into account}} the evolving shape and mass properties of the assembling spacecraft. Each spacecraft runs symmetric algorithms. The relative navigation is based on augmenting the target's state vector by introducing, as extra state components, the target's control inputs. By using the proposed navigation method, a chaser spacecraft can estimate the relative position, the attitude and the control inputs of a target spacecraft, flying in its proximity. The proposed approaches are successfully validated via hardware-in-the-loop experimentation, using four <b>autonomous</b> three-degree-of-freedom robotic <b>spacecraft</b> simulators, floating on a flat floor...|$|R
