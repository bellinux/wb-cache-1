5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door, only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E

Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was in bed at curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, [...] "...one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick". As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this [...] "...almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country".|$|E

As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days.

500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance if you turn up motivated, fit and organised and I think I can promise that." ...|$|E

In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens {{the next morning to}} realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{nomination}} of [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] at the Nebula Awards, there was criticism of {{the inclusion of a}} fan production. Keith DeCandido, writer of Star Trek tie-in novels, wrote on his blog [...] "Look, this isn't <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the fan films as such. But that's what they are – they're fan films. They are not professionally produced. What's more, they're unauthorized and, by the letter of the law, illegal. In fact, {{one of the reasons why}} they're not prosecuted, is because they don't turn a profit, which is one of the legion of ways that they're not professionally produced". In response, Zicree replied with a statement to the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, explaining that the episode was produced with the full knowledge of Paramount Pictures and CBS. He explained the involvement of Abrams, and the use of the Universal lot for filming as well as commenting on the crewmembers who were paid at industry standard rates. He later explained that executives at CBS Video wanted to licence [...] "World Enough and Time" [...] and include it on a Star Trek Blu-ray but they could not convince the chief executive.|$|E

500|$|Richard Bradley, {{editor-in-chief}} of Worth magazine, {{was the first}} mainstream journalist to question the Rolling Stone article, in a blog entry written on November 24, 2014. The entry began drawing national media attention {{in the days after}} paleoconservative pundit Steve Sailer made an entry on his own blog at the Unz Review on November 29 in which he discussed and linked to Bradley's piece. After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned about the way she investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website [...] "was pretty outdated". Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple rejected Erdely's statement, saying that the severity of the accusations she was reporting required [...] "every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door.

2500|$|Post-traumatic amnesia is {{generally}} {{due to a}} head injury (example: a fall, <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the head). Traumatic amnesia is often transient, but may be permanent or either anterograde, retrograde, or mixed type. The extent of the period covered by the amnesia {{is related to the}} degree of injury and may give an indication of the prognosis for recovery of other functions. [...] Mild trauma, such as a car accident that results in no more than mild whiplash, might cause the occupant of a car to have no memory of the moments just before the accident due to a brief interruption in the short/long-term memory transfer mechanism. The sufferer may also lose knowledge of who people are. Having longer periods of amnesia or consciousness after an injury may be an indication that recovery from remaining concussion symptoms will take much longer.|$|E
2500|$|The animal used {{to portray}} Nigger was an RAF dog, on loan to the production. [...] Richard Todd was the animal wrangler, and later {{recalled}} {{that the dog}} was an exemplary actor who hardly ever required a re-take. On two occasions, however, the dog caused difficulty. On the first occasion, the dog could not be persuaded to wait when filming the scene when Nigger answers <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> the door in Gibson's bedroom. [...] The second occasion was when filming on location at RAF Scampton, where Nigger and Gibson were to stroll through a group of RAF men waiting outside of a building for a briefing. [...] The dog could not be persuaded to move off one spot, or even dragged past it on a leash. [...] It later transpired that the spot was {{the site where the}} real Nigger had been buried, some 8 years before, whose gravestone had been temporarily removed for filming. [...] In the end, the scene was filmed without the dog.|$|E
