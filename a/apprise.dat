5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to <b>apprise</b> the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} {{days were}} spent stockpiling water, food, wood and other provisions. The Portuguese also built a massive—perhaps [...] long—wooden cross. Cabral ascertained {{that the new}} land lay east of the demarcation line between Portugal and Spain that had been specified in the Treaty of Tordesillas. The territory was thus within the sphere allotted to Portugal. To solemnize Portugal's claim to the land, the wooden cross was erected and a second religious service held on 1 May. In honor of the cross, Cabral named the newly discovered land Ilha de Vera Cruz (Island of the True Cross). The next day a supply ship {{under the command of}} either Gaspar de Lemos or André Gonçalves (the sources conflict on who was sent) returned to Portugal to <b>apprise</b> the King of the discovery.|$|E

2500|$|Based on Dusenbery {{as well as}} earlier cases, the State {{argued that}} once it {{provided}} notice reasonably calculated to <b>apprise</b> Jones of the impending tax sale by mailing him a certified letter, due process was satisfied. However, the Court pointed out that {{in each of those}} prior cases, the government had subsequently heard nothing back indicating that its attempts had failed. In Dusenbery, for example, the government knew that someone at the prison had signed for the letter. The knowledge that notice had failed was instead [...] "a new wrinkle," [...] and the question before the Court was therefore whether that knowledge constituted a circumstance that alters what notice is required. The Court believed that most federal courts of appeals and state supreme courts to have addressed this issue have decided that the government must do something more when it learns its attempt at notice has failed before it can sell real property in a tax sale. Many states also require by statute more than a simple notice by mail to the delinquent owner.|$|E
2500|$|This rule {{is perhaps}} most often {{violated}} by a chief, leading some commentators to question whether the rule should apply to a chief, or even whether a chief {{should be considered a}} charge at all rather than a division of the field. [...] These violations usually occur in the case of landscape heraldry and augmentations. [...] French civic heraldry, with its frequent chiefs of France (i.e. [...] "on a field azure, three fleurs-de-lys or", alternatively [...] "azure, seme-de-lys or"), often violates this rule when the field is of a colour. The coat of arms that appears on the famous tapestry of the Lady with the Unicorn was attributed until now by specialistes to the older branch and to the chief of the family Le Viste, Jean IV Le Viste, but it blatantly breaks the rules of French Heraldry. A new study of the tapestry suggests the probability of the intervention of a descendant of the younger branch, Antoine II Le Viste, as a sponsor of the tapestry, and indicates that the incorrect superposition of colours could have been a deliberated choice intended to <b>apprise</b> the observer in an excplicit manner that he was faced with the familiar phenomenon of the modifications of the arms by a mark of cadency. The arms of Harvard Law School, [...] "on a field azure, a chief gules", is another example. [...] An example from medieval England quoted by John Gibbon in 1682 is the arms of Denys of Siston, Gloucestershire, [...] "gules, 3 leopards' faces jessant-de-lys azure over all a bend engrailled azure".|$|E
