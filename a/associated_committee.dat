5000|$|When the American Commodore Matthew Perry {{arrived in}} 1853, Bettelheim served {{for a time}} as {{translator}} and intermediary. Over the missionary's objections, the Commodore established an American base within {{the grounds of the}} Gokoku-ji, including a fenced-off area for grazing cattle, something which drew strong protest from the Ryukyuan authorities. When Perry departed from his second visit to Okinawa a year later (having left and returned once in the interim), he was offered, among other gifts from the Kingdom to the United States, a temple bell from Shuri. This was found to be imperfect, so a bell from the Gokoku-ji was offered instead. This bell had been forged in 1456, during the reign of Shō Taikyū. The inscription upon it reads in part [...] "May the sound of this bell shatter illusory dreams, perfect the souls of mankind, and enable the King and his subjects to live so virtuously that barbarians will find no occasion to invade the Kingdom." [...] It being part of the Bettelheim residence, which had been desecrated and not used as a place of worship for roughly eight years, the Ryukyuan authorities were willing to part with it; Bettelheim likewise expressed in his diary elation at seeing the heathen temple further dismantled. Intended by Perry to be installed in or near the Washington Monument then under construction, the <b>associated</b> <b>committee</b> turned down the suggestion, and the bell was instead donated to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, where it was kept and rung in celebration of Navy victories in the annual Army-Navy football game, until it was finally returned to Japan in 1987.|$|E

Activities of geophysicists in Canada were coordinated by ACGG by forming a number of subcommittees. In 1974, the ACGG was replaced by a professional society called [...] "The Canadian Geophysical Union, a joined Division of the Geological Association of Canada (GAC) and of the Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP)", and with J.T.Wilson as its first president. The Canadian Geophysical Union became an independent organization in 1988, but today geophysicists still can join CGU by joining CAP or the Geophysics Division of GAC. In 1993, the CGU formed a Hydrology Section. Now with about 500 members, CGU serves as the national focus for geophysical sciences.|$|R
