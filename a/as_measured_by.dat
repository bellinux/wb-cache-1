5|$|CSF {{pressure}}, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> lumbar puncture, is 10–18 cmH2O (8–15 mmHg or 1.1–2 kPa) {{with the}} patient lying {{on the side and}} 20–30 cmH2O (16–24 mmHg or 2.1–3.2 kPa) {{with the patient}} sitting up. In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations are due to coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck. When lying down, the CSF pressure as estimated by lumbar puncture is similar to the intracranial pressure.|$|E

5|$|It was {{confirmed}} on December 13, 2010 that Voyager 1 {{had passed the}} reach of the radial outward flow of the solar wind, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event.

Thus, increasing tax allowance income by one percent would lower inequality in Estonia, Latvia, Czech Republic, Spain and Greece by between a 14 th and a 20 th of a percentage point. It would increase it in France, Belgium and Ireland by approximately a 20 th of a percentage point. Note that albeit statistically significant, these effects are small in magnitude.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{spawned a}} tropical depression near the Lesser Antilles on August30, which quickly became Tropical Storm Ella.

In the Dominican Republic, heavy rainfall and floods caused $100,000 in damage, mostly in the country's southwestern portion. Heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding in southwestern Haiti, and thousands of people became homeless after their houses were damaged. Near Les Cayes, 30people were killed due to flash flooding.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence. For example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, <b>as</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E

The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed.

5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven.
