5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or lands on a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers.

5|$|In {{people who}} develop acute liver failure {{or who are}} {{otherwise}} expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques {{have the advantage of}} supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take immunosuppressive medication {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

5|$|With Weir (Torri Higginson) incapacitated, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) {{is forced}} to take command of Atlantis. McKay (David Hewlett) determines that the power {{conduits}} are damaged, preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12-578. While teams are sent to patch them up, the shield starts to collapse, resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time to patch up the conduits. However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fix it before jumping again.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} a {{coordination}} game is the setting where two technologies are available to two firms with comparable products, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> elect a strategy to become the market standard. If both firms agree on the chosen technology, high sales are expected for both firms. If the firms do not agree on the standard technology, few sales result.

25|$|Both {{the bride}} and groom have to declare at the wedding which name they will use; <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> declare which family name their {{children}} will get (which can be changed until the birth of the first child). Children can get either parent's surname, if it is on the marriage certificate, but all children must have the same surname. Since 2004 they can also get a hyphenated name, but only if both parents kept their birth names at least as one part of their new name. Children usually get their father's surname, but hyphenated names are becoming more common.|$|E
25|$|Match V: CSK {{played against}} the sulking Delhi Daredevils who are {{struggling}} to record their first win this season. CSK chose to bat first after winning the toss and set a pretty solid target of 170. Michael Hussey and Mahendra Singh Dhoni played their ace game with good support from Suresh Raina. DD started their wobbly innings with David Warner cheaply gone for 1 run and wickets continued to fall in short intervals. DD succumbed to a meager 83. This could be considered {{as one of the}} worst performances of DD <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> win 9 of the next 10 games they have ahead of them.|$|E

25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be aware that they have to face the consequences of their actions.|$|E

At the same status conference, Durkin told the attorneys that he plans to modify the protective order to make it less restrictive. Rather than having all material that might be considered sensitive filed under seal, Durkin said that he might grant a motion directing lawyers to file a motion requesting that the material be filed under seal first. If Durkin granted such a motion, the attorneys would file both a complete copy under seal and a redacted copy that would be publicly available.|$|E

500|$|Further {{discussing}} the film's visuals, Derrickson described influences as [...] "the Steve Ditko, Stan Lee comics [...] {{were all about}} these weird visuals", as well as [...] "a fair amount of surrealist art and photography and M.C. Escher". Additional inspiration for the film's visuals came from [...] "a bunch of experimental, fractal videos from YouTube" [...] that Derrickson found, and the mobile video game Monument Valley. Derrickson's [...] "ambition was to use cutting-edge visual effects {{to do things that}} are fresh and new—to not just blow things up." [...] Feige explained that one of the more difficult areas to be inventive was the action sequences, as Derrickson did not want them [...] "to simply be: someone shoots a bolt of lightning, and someone blocks a ball of lightning, so someone throws another bolt of lightning..." [...] Instead, they tried to incorporate the use of different dimensions into the action [...] "in the interest of creating a visual tapestry that is totally different in terms of an action scene we’ve seen in any other movies." [...] On the film's set pieces, Derrickson reiterated that the film's astral fight scene was based on The Oath comic, while adding that the end fight was [...] "an attempt to capture the quality of that artwork" [...] from the original comics, and the mirror dimension chase was an attempt to take Inception [...] "to the Nth degree and take it way more surreal and way farther. But I certainly owe something to that movie." [...] Specifically for the climax of the film, Derrickson wanted to play on the superhero trope of [...] "a big fight scene where they're tearing up a city, and there's a portal opening up <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> close it", subverting it by having the villain defeated with an intelligent use of power rather than showing [...] "which CGI thing can hit the other CGI thing harder".|$|E
500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. I get that. Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be able to understand the issues.
