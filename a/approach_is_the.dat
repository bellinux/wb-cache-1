5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving the accuracy of prognosis. Some have found that the accuracy of prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E
5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} is fairly {{common in the}} United States and east Asian countries. The advantages of this <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique. The disadvantages of this <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> necessary high lifting capacity of building site cranes, additional expensive crane time, higher material costs and little flexibility.|$|R

5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> introduction of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill lepidopteran caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly toxic proteins, when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same toxic proteins are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact {{version of}} the LFI. She defends the {{distinction}} between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy {{in a number of}} imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves.|$|E

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> need {{to dispose of}} the ammonium sulfate byproduct. This problem has led some manufacturers to develop energy-efficient methods of separating formic acid from the excess water used in direct hydrolysis.

25|$|If {{yellow fever}} is suspected, the virus cannot be {{confirmed}} until six to 10 {{days after the}} illness.

25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E
30|$|Concerning the {{computational}} {{efforts of}} the per-pixel processes, in [9] a good analysis is given: speed and memory usage of some widely used algorithms are taken into account. Essentially, monomodal <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> generally <b>the</b> fastest, while multimodal and non-parametric techniques exhibit higher complexity. Regarding the memory usage, non-parametric <b>approaches</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most demanding, because they need to collect for each pixel a statistics on the past values.|$|R

After mating and selecting surviving cells on selective medium the scientist will sequence the isolated plasmids to see which prey (DNA sequence) is interacting with the used bait. This approach has a lower rate of reproducibility and tends to yield higher amounts of false positives compared to the matrix approach.|$|E

For example, the Greek sky-god Zeus Pater, the Roman sky-god Jupiter, and the Indian (Vedic) sky-god Dyauṣ Pitṛ have linguistically identical names.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen gas or {{ambient air}} {{can also be}} {{injected}} to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage of this <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted.|$|E

25|$|To {{obtain a}} rough {{idea of what}} phases might occur, one can use a model that {{has some of the}} same {{properties}} as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a four-fermion interaction. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> bag model, in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes unconfined quark matter.|$|E
25|$|To tackle this issue, one <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mean {{field or}} Ehrenfest method, where the {{molecular}} dynamics is {{run on the}} average potential energy surface given by a linear combination of the adiabatic states. This was applied successfully for some applications, but has some important limitations. When {{the difference between the}} adiabatic states is large, then the dynamics must be primarily driven by only one surface, and not an average potential. In addition, this method also violates the principle of microscopic reversibility.|$|E
25|$|A {{recording}} which showcases Rachmaninoff's <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Liszt Second Polonaise, {{recorded in}} 1925. Percy Grainger, {{who had been}} influenced by the composer and Liszt specialist Ferruccio Busoni, had himself recorded the same piece a few years earlier. Rachmaninoff's performance is far more taut and concentrated than Grainger's. The Russian's drive and monumental conception bear a considerable difference to the Australian's more delicate perceptions. Grainger's textures are elaborate. Rachmaninoff shows the filigree as essential to the work's structure, not simply decorative.|$|E
