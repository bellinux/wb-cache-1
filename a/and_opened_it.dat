5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to visitors. It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not see service during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again opened it to visitors. Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other ranks in the 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E
5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> up to a wider audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E

25|$|Inside {{the temple}} chamber was a Chac Mool statue and a throne {{in the shape}} of Jaguar, painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade. The Mexican {{government}} excavated a tunnel {{from the base of the}} north staircase, up the earlier pyramid's stairway to the hidden temple, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to tourists. In 2006, INAH closed the throne room to the public.|$|E
25|$|While the Readjustor Party faded, {{the goal}} of public {{education}} remained strong, with institutions established {{for the education of}} schoolteachers. In 1884, the state acquired a bankrupt women's college at Farmville <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> as a normal school. Growth of public education led to the need for additional teachers. In 1908, two additional normal schools were established, one at Fredericksburg and one at Harrisonburg, and in 1910, one at Radford.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, the Leagues renovated a four-screen art-house {{theater at}} 2700 Anderson Lane in North Austin, called Village Cinema, which had {{recently}} closed, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> as an Alamo Drafthouse which specialized in first-run movies. With this new Alamo Drafthouse Village, the downtown location ceased showing second-run movies {{and began to}} concentrate almost exclusively on unusual programming including classics, cult classics, independents, documentaries, special guest appearances, and audience participation shows.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prolific}} collector of Ruskiniana was John Howard Whitehouse, who saved Ruskin's home, Brantwood, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> {{as a permanent}} Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin's educational ideals, Whitehouse established Bembridge School, on the Isle of Wight, and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to Michael Ernest Sadler wrote about and appreciated Ruskin's ideas. Ruskin College, an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and Charles A. Beard.|$|E
25|$|Another Van Leuven home, {{bought in}} the 1920s by Mohonk Mountain House, {{became part of the}} Mohonk Preserve later in the century. During the 1960s and for several decades after, members of the Appalachian Mountain Club leased this house, affectionately known as the Appy Cabin, as a base for rock {{climbing}} on the nearby cliffs. Recognizing the building's value, the Mohonk Preserve restored the cabin, renamed it in honor of its last resident Eli Van Leuven, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> as a historic structure.|$|E

25|$|Several initial assaults failed {{until the}} Doge had the ships tied into pairs, thus {{doubling}} their momentum as the sailed against the fortifications. As the Venetians seized two towers, the Frankish Crusaders took a gate <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to their comrades. Alexios V tried to rally a counter-attack but when this failed, he fled to Thrace with his mistress Eudokia Angelina {{and her mother}} Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera. There Alexios V and Eudokia were married, solidifying hie relation to the Angeloi. He was later captured by the Crusaders in 1205 and flung to death.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Anderson's husband, Orpheus Fisher, {{died after}} 43 years of marriage. Anderson {{remained}} {{in residence at}} Marianna Farm until 1992, one year before her death. Although the property was sold to developers, various preservationists {{as well as the}} City of Danbury fought to protect Anderson's studio. Their efforts proved successful and the Danbury Museum and Historical Society received a grant from the State of Connecticut, relocated the structure, restored it, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to the public in 2004. In addition to seeing the studio, visitors can see photographs and memorabilia from milestones in Anderson's career.|$|E
25|$|On 18 March 1808, 200 Imperial French {{soldiers}} {{asked to}} be admitted within the precincts of the fortress and were allowed in, since the French {{were believed to be}} allies. Once inside, they seized the main gate <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to an entire regiment. The stunned Spanish garrison was quickly expelled. Since its capture, the French had used Sant Ferran as a major supply base for the sieges of Roses in 1808 and Gerona in 1809. But after three years, the French generals grew complacent and in April 1811 the key fort was only held by an Italian provisional battalion.|$|E

25|$|In parallel, the Harbour Commission built Malton Airport airfield, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> in 1939. Before its completion, Toronto City Council made {{arrangements}} for the Government of Canada {{to take over the}} field, which was christened Bishop Field (to honour the same flying ace for which the island airport was later renamed after) in 1939. The Malton field was intended to be used for training, as the centre for the trans-Canada air system, and used when visibility was poor at the island. Trans-Canada Airlines inaugurated passenger service at Malton and ultimately rejected the island airport due to its short runways. Malton ultimately became Toronto's main airport instead of the island airport.|$|E
25|$|A {{private company}} built the Highlands Turnpike to the west, in more level country, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> in 1806. This {{diverted}} traffic {{away from the}} section north of Peekskill through Continental Village and past the lakes. Iron mining at Hopper Lake in the 1820s partially replaced it, and the stage route was not changed. The old road fell into further disuse when the turnpike became a public highway in 1833 {{and it was no}} longer needed as a shunpike. The completion of the Hudson River Railroad to Albany in 1850 made the road obsolete as a commercial and postal artery, and stage service ended.|$|E
25|$|The Library Company {{suffered}} financial troubles {{during the}} Great Depression {{and was forced}} to sell the Locust Street building and consolidate the collections in the Ridgway Library on South Broad Street. As its fortunes improved after the war, the institution focused on its mission as a scholarly research library. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, under the direction of Edwin Wolf, an energetic program of renewal brought the Library Company once more into a busy and vital center of national importance for research and education. The Library Company completed a new building on Locust Street, also named the Ridgway Library, in 1965, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to the public in April 1966.|$|E

25|$|Although most of {{the early}} Doukhobor village {{structures}} in British Columbia have vanished or been significantly remodeled by later users, a part of Makortoff Village outside of Grand Forks, British Columbia has been preserved as a museum by Peter Gritchen, who purchased the property in 1971 <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> as the Mountain View Doukhobor Museum on June 16, 1972. The future of the site became uncertain {{after his death in}} 2000, but, in cooperation with a coalition of the local organizations and concerned citizens, the historical site, known as Hardy Mountain Doukhobor Village, was purchased by The Land Conservancy of British Columbia in March 2004, while the museum collection was acquired by the Boundary Museum Society and loaned to TLC for display.|$|E
25|$|When Mrs. Brehm died in 1962, the Old Mill was willed to the City of San Marino. The {{city has}} {{preserved}} the building <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> {{to the public}} as a museum and art gallery (California Art Club Gallery), operated first by the California Historical Society and later by the Old Mill Foundation. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. A model showing how the mill operated is located {{on the ground floor of}} the museum. While nothing remains of the waterwheel, two of the millstones (pictured above) are displayed in the garden area. The millstones were found more than a century after the mill closed on the grounds of the Huntington Library by General George S. Patton, who grew up in the area and recalled seeing them used as blocks for mounting horses. There is also a 16th-century volcanic rock fountain in the patio to the east of the mill. The fountain was acquired in Mexico by Mrs. Brehm's daughter, Mrs. Albert Doerr.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, in Scotland, he gave $10 {{million to}} {{establish}} the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. It was created by a deed which he signed on June 7, 1901, and it was incorporated by Royal Charter on August 21, 1902. The establishing gift of $10 million was, then, an unprecedented sum: at the time, total government assistance to all four Scottish universities was about £50,000 a year. The aim of the Trust was to improve and extend the opportunities for scientific research in the Scottish universities and to enable the deserving and qualified youth of Scotland to attend a university. He was subsequently elected Lord Rector of University of St. Andrews in December 1901. He also donated {{large sums of money}} to Dunfermline, the place of his birth. In addition to a library, Carnegie also bought the private estate which became Pittencrieff Park <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to all members of the public, establishing the Carnegie Dunfermline Trust to benefit the people of Dunfermline. A statue of him stands there today.|$|E
