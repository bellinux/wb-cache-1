5|$|In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst {{predicted}} that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> gas; and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is {{not affected by}} dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift {{can be used to}} map the motion of the gas in our galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of our galaxy. With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Zinc oxide nanorod sensors are devices {{detecting}} {{changes in}} electric current passing through zinc oxide nanowires due to adsorption of gas molecules. Selectivity to hydrogen gas {{was achieved by}} sputtering Pd clusters on the nanorod surface. The addition of Pd appears {{to be effective in}} the catalytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules into <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> increasing the sensitivity of the sensor device. The sensor detects hydrogen concentrations down to 10 parts per million at room temperature, whereas there is no response to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since contaminants in the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

The intensity ratio of recorded <b>hydrogen</b> <b>atomic</b> lines to <b>hydrogen</b> molecular lines gives qualitative information about the degree of dissociation.

5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} <b>atomic</b> <b>hydrogen</b> first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
