In this paper, the effect of various factors on the speciation transformation of typical inorganic polymer flocculants (IPFs) -polyaluminum chloride (PACl) was investigated by ferron <b>assay.</b> <b>Dilution</b> and co-existing electrolyte exhibit {{little effect on the}} speciation distribution of PACl after dosing. Solution pH has significant effect on the species transformation, depending mainly on OH/AI ratio (denoted as B value). The lower the B value, the more significant the effect pH exhibits. A large amount of Al(b), i. e. rapid reactive species by ferron assay, could form for alum and PACl(0) in the weak acidic pH range, which transforms quickly into Al(c) after aging. PACl, at high B values, maintains high speciation stability under the various conditions investigated. The ferron method provides a measure to explain the reactivity of different species with ferron.

Techniques based on conservation of T-cell receptor CDR 3 length are increasingly widely used, often without assessment of sensitivity or specificity. We present a comparative evaluation of a novel modified heteroduplex technique and a CDR 3 -length-based <b>assay.</b> <b>Dilution</b> of a known clone in a mixed T-cell population shows that in our hands the heteroduplex technique is at least 10 -fold more sensitive than the CDR 3 -length-based assay. However, even with this level of sensitivity, we do not detect clonal expansions in unstimulated CD 4 + T cells. This contrasts with the frequent detection of CD 8 + clones in fresh samples and suggests different mechanisms of clonal homeostasis in the two subsets. We show that both techniques detect functional expansions after in vitro stimulation with a recall antigen. The distinct molecular footprint seen with the heteroduplex technique allows reproducible follow up of specific clonal expansions.

This assay simultaneously uses three differently labeled probes targeted to HSV- 1 (FAM), HSV- 2 (NED), and to the manufacturer's Internal Control (VIC). HSV- 1 / 2 typing capability and quantitation accuracy were determined using HSV stocks and quality control panels. Performance in routine clinical testing was compared with a nested HSV- 1 / 2 PCR <b>assay.</b> <b>Dilution</b> series and quality control panel testing revealed an approximately 10 -fold higher HSV- 2 sensitivity in real-time PCR compared with an in-house nested PCR assay. The sensitivity for HSV- 1 was comparable in both assays. All HSV-positive proficiency panel samples (n = 21) and virus stocks were typed correctly as HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 using real-time PCR. Quantitation correlated well with reference values (HSV- 1, r = 0. 98; HSV- 2, r = 0. 88), and 95 % detection limits were determined as 9. 4 HSV- 2 copies/reaction and 18 HSV- 1 copies/reaction. Based on Ct values, the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation was 1 %, whereas the interassay coefficient of variations were 2. 7 % and 2. 5 % for HSV- 1 and - 2, respectively.

The presented {{study was designed to}} evaluate the potency of extracted, purified and formulated insulin from the pancreatic organs of the Sudanese beef cattle. Twenty healthy rabbits were used to conduct the study following subcutaneous administration of the sample insulin, to determine the hypoglycemic effect and to analyze the potency of the testing insulin by the hypoglycemic seizure method, blood sugar method and glucose enzymatic colorimetric test (GOD-PAP) respectively. The potency of the injected insulin samples was estimated by comparing the variation in blood glucose levels produced in the treated animals with that produced by a standard insulin preparation under the suitable conditions of the blood sugar method. The results revealed that the potency of the testing beef insulin samples was slightly higher (i. e., 2. 2 USP units/ml, 9 %) compared to the standard and assumed potency of the prepared insulin preparations (i. e., 1 - 2 USP units/ml) which indicated that the solvents and diluents used to prepare the <b>assay</b> <b>dilution</b> might be of higher potency and must be diluted {{to such an extent that}} the testing insulin potency must be compatible with the standard dilutions.

40|$|Abstract Background The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have {{complicated}} and poorly characterized pharmacokinetics. There are two binding sites per ACE (high affinity "C", lower affinity "N") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. Most inhibitors are given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. This paper describes {{the first human}} physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of this drug class. Methods The model {{was applied to the}} experimental data of van Griensven et. al for the pharmacokinetics of ramiprilat and its prodrug ramipril. It describes the time course of the inhibition of the N and C ACE sites in plasma and the different tissues. The model includes: 1) two independent ACE binding sites; 2) non-equilibrium time dependent binding; 3) liver and kidney ramipril intracellular uptake, conversion to ramiprilat and extrusion from the cell; 4) intestinal ramipril absorption. The experimental in vitro ramiprilat/ACE binding kinetics at 4 Â°C and 300 mM NaCl were assumed for most of the PBPK calculations. The model was incorporated into the freely distributed PBPK program PKQuest. Results The PBPK model provides an accurate description of the individual variation of the plasma ramipril and ramiprilat and the ramiprilat renal clearance following IV ramiprilat and IV and oral ramipril. Summary of model features: Less than 2 % of total body ACE is in plasma; 35 % of the oral dose is absorbed; 75 % of the ramipril metabolism is hepatic and 25 % of this is converted to systemic ramiprilat; 100 % of renal ramipril metabolism is converted to systemic ramiprilat. The inhibition was long lasting, with 80 % of the C site and 33 % of the N site inhibited 24 hours following a 2. 5 mg oral ramipril dose. The plasma ACE inhibition determined by the standard assay is significantly less than the true in vivo inhibition because of <b>assay</b> <b>dilution.</b> Conclusion If the in vitro plasma binding kinetics of the ACE inhibitor for the two binding sites are known, a unique PBPK model description of the Griensven et. al. experimental data can be obtained. </p...|$|E

40|$|Human {{strongyloidiasis}} {{is commonly}} referred to as Âthreadworm infectionÂ. Most cases of strongyloidiasis manifest as chronic mild, or asymptomatic intestinal infection that last many years. However, in certain circumstances, parasites can rapidly multiply in a patient, disseminate more widely to other organs, and cause life threatening infection. Diagnosis of strongyloidiasis can generally be undertaken by parasitological diagnosis, usually microscopy, coproculture (Harada Mori, or Baermann), or by detection of parasitespecific antibodies by ELISA. Each of these approaches have drawbacks. Similar problems have been encountered with the diagnosis of many other intestinal parasites. One way of overcoming the shortfalls of diagnostic tests of other intestine infections has been the use of coproantigen assays. Coproantigen assays are commercially available for diagnosis of a range of human and animal helminth, protozoan, bacterial and viral infections, where their sensitivity and specificity is satisfactory. For the detection of Strongyloides spp in faeces, only one coproantigen detection assay has been published for the detection of S. ratti. In this assay, whole parasitic worm antigen was used to raise polyclonal antiserum. However, the assay was relatively insensitive, and its utility to detect human Strongyloides was not investigated. In addition, compared to research undertaken in other well-studied parasites such as Hookworms, Taenia spp. and Echinococcus spp, {{little is known about the}} identity and function of E/S proteins or indeed other proteins of Strongyloides spp. In this study, a panel of antibodies was raised against S. ratti to explore the utility of Strongyloides specific antibodies for the development of a diagnostic assay and to study the biology of the parasite. The first results chapter reports the development and optimisation of a technique to isolate S. ratti excretory/secretory (E/S) antigens, and the generation of high titre antiserum in both rabbits (&# 945;-E/S Ab) and mice (StrE/S MAb). &# 945;-E/S Ab contained antibodies that cross-reacted with rat intestinal proteins and the dominant contaminant at ~ 75 kDa was determined to be rat serum albumin. Many techniques were attempted to reduce the level of cross-reactive antibodies within the antibody preparation and the successful technique utilised adsorption against a combination of uninfected rat faecal supernatant, sham E/S and uninfected rat serum. This final serum was used in a faecal supernatant immunoprecipitation experiment to purify Strongyloides coproantigen. This immunoprecipitation/coproantigen complex was utilised for the generation of monoclonal antibodies. One specific monoclonal antibody (StrE/S MAb) was generated and displayed high levels of immunoreactivity with S. ratti and S. stercoralis larval and parasitic adult worm antigens, while not cross-reacting with any rat proteins. In immunolocalisation experiments, StrE/S MAb was observed to bind to specific cells in the ovaries, including the ova. In the second results chapter the utility of a polyclonal &# 945;-E/S antibody raised against S. ratti E/S to detect coproantigen is reported. High levels of cross-reactivity was observed when faecal supernatants were extracted in a common extraction buffer PBS-T or 70 % Ethanol. In contrast with many published coproantigen ELISAs, the addition of foetal calf serum or rat serum in the assay did not improve the signal:noise ratio. However, when faecal supernatants were extracted in formalin levels cross-reactivity with faecal components was eliminated, while preserving the positive signal in infected samples. Coproantigen stability was explored with a panel of faecal samples preserved at 4 Â°C, extracted and unextracted in formalin. Interestingly, formalin-extracted faecal supernatants stored at 4 Â°C tested negative, whereas faecal samples preserved, unextracted in formalin remained coproELISA positive. Finally, three consecutive stool samples were collected from a patient infected with S. stercoralis and extracted in formalin. The stool samples collected tested negative for larvae by sodium nitrate flotation and Baermann concentration, suggesting a sub-patent infection. All three faecal supernatants tested coproELISA positive at the standard <b>assay</b> <b>dilution</b> namely 1 / 4 and remained positive when diluted further to 1 / 8. The final results chapter describes the characterisation of a monoclonal antibody raised against S. ratti parasitic adult worm extract (MAb 8 C 3) by molecular, histochemical and proteomic techniques. Specificity for the parasitic adult worm lifecycle stage alone was demonstrated by immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Using immunohistochemistry the target organ of MAb 8 C 3 was identified as nerve cords in the parasitic adult worm hypodermis. Proteomic analysis identified MAb 8 C 3 Âs target antigen as the 10 kDa chaperone protein, CPN 10. The validity of standard proteomic analysis for the characterization of nematode proteins and the characterization of S. ratti CPN 10 is discussed...|$|E

Further studies are needed to explore the applicability of these silver-supported anti- microbial agents in clinical dentistry...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{analyses}} of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in vaccinated and infected macaques {{may help to}} clarify the role of CTL immunity in protection against lentiviruses. Here, the optimal conditions for the measurement of SIV Gag-specific CTL were investigated by bulk and limiting <b>dilution</b> <b>assays</b> of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from naive and vaccinated cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with SIVmac 32 H(J 5). In vitro restimulation was generally required for CTL detection. Selective activation of CD 8 + and MHC-restricted SIV Gag-specific CTL was induced by stimulation with autologous para-formaldehyde-fixed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIV Gag. Applied to limiting <b>dilution</b> <b>assays,</b> antigenic stimulation reproducibly demonstrated SIV Gag-specific CTL precursors (CTLp) in PBMC of all animals studied, including those lacking significant responses in standard bulk CTL assays...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{effect of}} essential oils on Aspergillus spore germination, growth and mycotoxin production. MethodIn vitro antifungal and antiaflatoxigenic activity of essential oils {{was carried out}} using poisoned food techniques, spore germination <b>assay,</b> agar <b>dilution</b> <b>assay,</b> and aflatoxin arresting assay on toxigenic strains of Aspergillus species. ResultsCymbopogon martinii, Foeniculum vulgare and Trachyspermum ammi (T. ammi) essential oils were tested against toxicogenic isolates of Aspergillus species. T. ammi oil showed highest antifungal activity. Absolute mycelial inhibition was recorded at 1 Î¼l/mL by essential oils of T. ammi. The oil also showed, complete inhibition of spore germination at a concentration of 2 Î¼l/mL. In addition, T. ammi oil showed significant antiaflatoxigenic potency by totally inhibiting aflatoxin production from Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus at 0. 5 and 0. 75 Î¼l/mL, respectively. Cymbopogon martinii, Foeniculum vulgare and T. ammi oils as antifungal were found superior over synthetic preservative. Moreover, a concentration of 5 [*] 336. 297 Î¼l/kg body weight was recorded for LC 50 on mice indicating the low mammalian toxicity and strengthening its traditional reputations. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the essential oils from T. ammi can be a potential source of safe natural food preservative for food commodities contamination by storage fungi...|$|R
