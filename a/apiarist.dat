500|$|Frank McNamara (62), an <b>apiarist,</b> and Geoff Inkpen (25), a young farmer, {{heard the}} sound of a big {{aircraft}} in serious trouble, flying low nearby. McNamara described the noise from the engines as [...] "terrifying". They investigated and saw the bright light of a flash fire. McNamara sent his two teenage sons in his utility truck to York to alert the police. McNamara and Inkpen then set out on foot {{in the direction of the}} fire. As there was bright moonlight, they were able to hurry through the bush. After about half an hour, they came upon a scene of devastation. They were astonished to find an elderly man in a dazed state wandering around the burning wreckage. He gave his name and explained that he had been a passenger on a large aircraft. He had survived the crash despite being badly burned. No one else was found alive.|$|E
500|$|As the apiary {{became a}} {{research}} laboratory, classroom and an extension {{service to the}} state, the demand increased for these services and thus it became necessary to maintain additional hives. It is for these reasons that, in 1913, Dr. Gates hired John L. Byard as superintendent of the apiary. Some of Byard's responsibilities included performing wax extractions, running the college's apicultural exhibit at fairs and maintaining the hive yard from day to day. [...] He would continue to maintain the building, the equipment and the hives {{until his death in}} 1920; professors Henry T. Fernald and Arthur I. Bourne would continue his work until his successor arrived the following year. Gates had been promoted from an assistant to an associate professor in 1915, and had continued to work both as a lecturer and as the <b>apiarist</b> of the experimental station. From 1913 to 1914 he was made president of the National Beekeepers' Association, twice hosting conventions in Amherst concluding the college's winter and spring sessions of the college beekeeping school. However, in 1918 he left Amherst for a professorship at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, leaving his former position open for the two years that followed. Gates' and Byard's duties would be taken up by several different people in the next decade. From 1921 to 1923 all beekeeping and apiology work at the Experimental Station was taken up by Professor Norman Phillips, who soon resigned for a job at a commercial apiary. He was replaced by Professor Morton H. Cassidy, an alumnus of the college, who stayed for 3 more years but ultimately had to resign due to his severe asthma. In 1926, a Mr. Clayton L. Farrar was made instructor of beekeeping. Farrar, a graduate of Kansas Agricultural College, also performed extensive work on several entomology projects as a research assistant before leaving in 1931 to work at a Federal laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The {{flowering}} {{patterns of}} 28 Victorian melliferous (honey-producing) eucalypts were investigated by using long-term observations of highly experienced, commercial <b>apiarists.</b> Frequency, timing, duration {{and intensity of}} flowering were determined, as were spatial differences within and among species. Data were obtained by face-to-face interviews with 25 Victorian <b>apiarists,</b> each of whom had operated a minimum of 350 hives {{for a minimum of}} 30 years. Flowering frequency ranged from 1 to 7 years, and most species flowered once every 2 – 4 years. Long-term flowering frequency, timing and duration were reported as constant, although short-term perturbations could occur. Most melliferous species flowered during spring and summer for a period of 3 months or more. Only few species had shorter flowering periods. Information provided by <b>apiarists</b> compared well with available published information (e. g. flowering period reported in field guides) and revealed a reliable, largely untapped source of long-term data, the use of which could benefit many ecological research endeavours. <br /...|$|R

60|$|Some one said, 'Oh, God!' The Agent-General {{went out}} {{over the back of}} the car, crying resolutely: 'Stop the traffic! Stop the traffic, there!' Penfentenyou was already on the {{pavement}} ringing a door-bell, so I had both their rugs, which--for I am an apiarist--I threw over my head. While I was tucking my trousers into my socks--for I am an <b>apiarist</b> of experience--Mr. Lingnam picked up the unexploded bonnet-box and with a single magnificent gesture (he told us afterwards he thought there was a river beneath) hurled it over the parapet of the bridge, ere he ran across the road towards the village green. Now, the station platform immediately below was crowded with Foresters and their friends waiting to welcome a delegation from a sister Court. I saw the box burst on the flint edging of the station garden and the contents sweep forward cone-wise like shrapnel. But the result was stimulating rather than sedative. All those well-dressed people below shouted like Sodom and Gomorrah. Then they moved as a unit into the booking-office, the waiting-rooms, and other places, shut doors and windows and declaimed aloud, while the incoming train whistled far down the line.|$|E
60|$|The Forester's band no more {{knew what}} was coming than do troops under sudden fire. Indeed, there were the same extravagant {{gestures}} and contortions as attend wounds and deaths in war; the very same uncanny cessations of speech--for the trombone was cut off at midslide, even as a man drops with a syllable on his tongue. They clawed, they slapped, they fled, leaving behind them a trophy of banners and brasses crudely arranged round the big drum. Then that end of the street also shut its windows, and the village, stripped of life, lay round me like a reef at low tide. Though I am, as I have said, an <b>apiarist</b> in good standing, I never realised that there were so many bees in the world. When they had woven a flashing haze {{from one end of the}} desert street to the other, there remained reserves enough to form knops and pendules on all window-sills and gutter-ends, without diminishing the multitudes in the three oozing bonnet-boxes, or drawing on the Fourth (Railway) Battalion in charge of the station below. The prisoners in the waiting-rooms and other places there cried out a great deal (I argued that they were dying of the heat), and at regular intervals the stationmaster called and called to a signalman who was not on duty, and the train whistled as it drew nearer.|$|E

Concerning the chemical parameters, honey samples were found to meet European Legislation (EC Directive 2001 / 110) except for water content of four samples. Microbiologically, the commercial quality was considered good and all samples showed to be negative in respect to safety parameters.

50|$|An apiary (also {{known as}} a bee yard) {{is a place where}} {{beehives}} of honey bees are kept. Traditionally beekeepers (also known as <b>apiarists)</b> paid land rent in honey for the use of small parcels. Some farmers will provide free apiary sites, because they need pollination, and farmers who need many hives often pay for them to be moved to the crops when they bloom. It can also be a wall-less, roofed structure, similar to a gazebo.|$|R

40|$|A two-year {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in the Northeast geo political zone of Nigeria to assess the rate of beehive colonisation in apiaries using improved and traditional methods of beekeeping. Snow-ball and purposive sampling methods were applied to select 185 traditional and three low-technology (Kenya TopBar Beehives: KTBH) <b>apiarists,</b> respectively, from the study area. A four-item open-ended questionnaire was used to collect data from the respondents in 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. Findings show that majority of the <b>apiarists</b> used local attractants in bee baiting with cow dung accounting for 47. 4 % and 26. 9 % as the larger proportions in 2015 and 2016, respectively. While cumulatively beehive colonisation accounted for only 22. 5 % against 77. 5 % empty beehives in the first year, the second year recorded 62. 5 % and 37. 5 % colonised and unoccupied beehives, respectively. It’s therefore, {{concluded that there was}} a remarkably low rate of beehive colonisation in the study area. In this regards, research-based institutions should intensify efforts towards providing effective training on colony division for local farmers, financial assistance to beekeeping beginners and beekeeping-based curricula by institutions of learning to capture youths as future apiculturists for sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Honey production, output, processing, {{marketing}} and quality in Adamawa State of Nigeria were studied through survey on four local governments of honey production. There were also physicochemical, microbial and sensory evaluations of samples to evaluate quality.

Methods of detecting honey adulteration locally include visual inspection and tongue testing methods. Laboratory evaluations to detect adulteration with caramel or water showed that match-lighting test can detect adulteration with water from 20 % water: honey ratio but could not detect adulteration with caramel.

50|$|Industry in {{the area}} {{consists}} of four commercial plant nurseries and three large stonefruit orchards.

50|$|Honey bees collect flower nectar {{and convert}} it to honey, which {{is stored in}} the hive.
