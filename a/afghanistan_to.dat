5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} Taliban. Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of Taliban control in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E

The B-52s took over heavy bombing after B-1 Lancers that had been conducting airstrikes rotated out of the region in January 2016.

5|$|The 3rd Brigade Combat Team was {{slated to}} deploy to Iraq in 2009, but that {{deployment}} was rerouted. In January 2009, the 3rd BCT instead deployed to Kunar, Logar and Wardak Provinces, eastern <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> relieve the 101st Airborne Division, {{as part of}} a new buildup of US forces in that country. The brigade was responsible for expanding forward operating bases and combat outposts (COPs) in the region, as well as strengthening US military presence in preparation for additional US forces to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{activated}} in April 1986, at Fort Drum, New York, {{when the}} 10th Mountain Division was reactivated {{as one of}} the Army's new Light Infantry Divisions. 1st Brigade and its subordinates saw numerous deployments to contingencies around the world in the 1990s. With the War on Terrorism the brigade has seen multiple deployments to <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> support Operation Enduring Freedom and to Iraq to support Operation Iraqi Freedom.|$|E
5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As Manhattan {{is one of the}} United States' greatest military powers, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviet Union invading <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> create {{the foundation of}} the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Ban Chao (d.AD 102) {{enlisted the}} aid of the Kushan Empire, occupying the area of modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana. When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises (r.c.90–c.100 AD) for a {{marriage}} alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90, he sent his forces to Wakhan (<b>Afghanistan)</b> <b>to</b> attack Ban Chao. The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies. In AD 91, the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao.|$|E
5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry and 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment (4–31 Infantry), deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. These forces remained in the country until mid-2002, fighting to secure remote {{areas of the country}} and participating in operations such as Operation Anaconda, the Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, and the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. The division also participated in fighting in the Shahi Khot Valley in 2002. Upon the return of the battalions, they were welcomed home and praised by President Bush. In 2003, {{elements of}} the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division returned to <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> support US forces operating in the western region of the country.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Army's Border Roads Organisation {{constructed}} a major road in 2009 {{in the remote}} Afghan province of Nimroz, connecting Delaram to Zaranj. This has proved a viable alternative route for the duty-free movement of goods through the Chabahar port in Iran <b>to</b> <b>Afghanistan.</b> Key <b>to</b> India's strategy in <b>Afghanistan</b> is <b>to</b> build up transportation links that bypass Pakistan, helping reduce the Afghan economy's dependence on Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{former chief}} of army staff General Ashfaq Kayani and {{previously}} the director-general of the ISI, has repeatedly stated to the media that the Pakistan armed forces's [...] "strategic depth" [...] policy with regards <b>to</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> is not <b>to</b> [...] "control" [...] <b>Afghanistan</b> but <b>to</b> ensure a [...] "peaceful, friendly and stable" [...] relationship with Afghanistan. This policy therefore aims to ensure that Pakistan will not be threatened with long-term security problems on its Western border with <b>Afghanistan.</b> According <b>to</b> Kayani, a 'talibanised' Afghanistan is not in Pakistan's interests.|$|R

Darius I controlled the Indus Valley from Gandhara to modern Karachi and appointed the Greek Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean {{from the mouth of}} the Indus to Suez. Darius then marched through the Bolan Pass and returned through Arachosia and Drangiana back to Persia.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>to</b> fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E

Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives. After evading capture for almost a decade, Osama bin Laden was located and killed by SEAL Team Six of the U.S. Navy in May 2011.|$|E
