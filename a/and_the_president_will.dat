30|$|The {{continuing}} {{efforts to}} repeal {{and replace the}} Affordable Care Act proposes to roll back the successful innovations of the law, reducing the ample impact this law has achieved in improving the American health care system. Any repeal would place greater pressure on the nation’s public health care system and non –profit health care facilities that serve the poor and disabled populations. Since enactment, the ACA has resulted in more {{children and young adults}} having access to quality medical service to prevent and treat serious illnesses. Many low-income Americans are receiving more quality medical services than even before, slowly improving the nation’s health status and longevity rates. With the recent actions by the Congress to not make any changes to this vital program, we can only hope that the Congress <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> agree upon a compromise plan in the near future. Any efforts should be made to address concerns and improve the ACA rather than repeal it.
