5|$|I had viewed Hitler and his {{movement}} with some skepticism, {{but when the}} abolition of the multi-party mess removed the obscenity of unemployment, and the first 1,000 kilometers of autobahns opened up <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> mobility, I too saw the light: this was the time when Churchill said he hoped Great Britain would have a man like Hitler in time of peril, and when high church dignitaries and distinguished academics paid the Führer homage.|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 {{at the end}} of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{invention}} of pendulum clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (balance spring) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{left his}} mark on Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} racing {{as a world}} championship winning rider, an advocate for increased safety standards in racing, and as a racing team owner and a motorcycle engine and chassis constructor. His dirt track-based riding style changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. Roberts' proposal to create a rival motorcycle championship in 1979 broke the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) hegemony and increased the political clout of Grand Prix racers, which subsequently led to improved safety standards and <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> professionalism in the sport. In 2000, Roberts was named a Grand Prix Legend by the FIM.|$|E
5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel. With {{the invention of the}} Bessemer process in the mid-19th century, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> mass-produced steel began. This was followed by the Siemens-Martin process and then the Gilchrist-Thomas process that refined the quality of steel. With their introductions, mild steel replaced wrought iron.|$|E

5|$|The late 1930s saw the {{emergence}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> tolerance in the United States. National leaders hailed the Bill of Rights, particularly as it protected minorities, as the essence of democracy. The 1939 Supreme Court decision in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization affirmed the right of communists to promote their cause. Even conservative elements, such as the American Bar Association began to campaign for civil liberties, which were long {{considered to be the}} domain of left-leaning organizations. By 1940, the ACLU had achieved many of the goals it set in the 1920s, and many of its policies were the law of the land.|$|E
5|$|By the 1840s, the {{boarding}} school {{had grown to}} 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin. The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school {{was on the brink}} of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school. This event marked the beginning of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> significant growth for Lindenwood.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> economic prosperity {{and the rise}} of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 {{the first}} transatlantic flight by a jet began <b>a</b> {{completely}} <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> {{competition for the}} Cunard Queens. On some voyages, winters especially, Queen Mary sailed into harbour with more crew than passengers, though both she and Queen Elizabeth still averaged over 1,000 passengers per crossing into the middle 1960s. By 1965, the entire Cunard fleet was operating at a loss.|$|R
25|$|One find {{from such}} a program was the sour gas {{discovery}} at the village of Caroline, Alberta in south-central Alberta, in the mid-1980s. This discovery brought the industry into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era.</b> Because <b>of</b> the costs and dangers involved in developing sour gas, producers in the past had often shut in these discoveries. In the case of Caroline, this was unthinkable.|$|R
50|$|The New York World {{was founded}} in 1860 but was <b>a</b> {{relatively}} unsuccessful <b>New</b> York newspaper from 1860 to 1883. Joseph Pulitzer purchased it in 1883, and <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> aggressive <b>era</b> <b>of</b> circulation building began. In 1890, Pulitzer built the New York World Building, the tallest office building {{in the world at}} the time (it was razed in 1955).|$|R
5|$|Ralph Klein, {{the former}} mayor of Calgary, led the party into the 1993 election, {{promising}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> debt reduction and fiscal accountability. He walked away with a slim majority. Ralph Klein's folksy appeal helped the Progressive Conservatives renew themselves. He led the party through two elections, gaining in popularity each time. The price of oil rebounded and the government, despite low rates of taxes on the wealthy and corporations, was showing a surplus of $3 billion every year. In early 2004, Klein announced that the Alberta debt had been paid in full. He was rewarded by voters in the 2004 election, despite running a campaign with no new policies. His party lost a number of seats, and during the campaign he stated this would be his last election. In 2006 at a Progressive Conservative convention delegates forced him to pick a retirement date by giving him relatively low numbers in a leadership review.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a few key swing states that often decided national elections. Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets. In 1888 Benjamin Harrison, one of the state's former Civil War generals, was elected president of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy {{ended the}} Civil War with about fifty monitor-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s {{most of these}} were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA {{virtually}} without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw {{the beginning of what}} became the Great White Fleet, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish–American War of 1898. This started <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> <b>of</b> naval warfare.|$|E
