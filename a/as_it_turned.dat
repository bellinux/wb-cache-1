5|$|August 13, 1971– A {{tropical}} depression strikes Fort Myers, {{turns to the}} northwest into the Gulf of Mexico, intensifies <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> to the northeast, and moves ashore near Steinhatchee. The depression produces hurricane-force wind gusts at Cedar Key and drops rainfall of over 8inches (203mm), resulting in some coastal flooding.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January19 off {{the east}} coast of Madagascar, which became Tropical Disturbance 6 two days later. It drifted to the east, strengthening to tropical depression status on January22, and passing 330km (205mi) west of Réunion. Increased wind shear caused the system to weaken <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> back to the west, dissipating over Madagascar on January24. On Réunion, the system dropped about 100mm (4in) of rainfall, including a total of 50mm (2in) falling in a 90minute period in Cape Bernard.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up forward speed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity {{the following day}} {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E

5|$|Early on August3, Arlene {{began to}} weaken <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> towards the west once more. The storm {{continued}} to slowly weaken before rapidly degenerating into a tropical depression on August4. The quick decrease in intensity {{was the result}} of a sudden increase in vertical wind shear near the core of the cyclone. Later that day, the system passed near the northern Leeward Islands; however, the depression was poorly organized. The former hurricane steadily tracked northwestward and began to regenerate on August7.|$|E

5|$|Henriette {{continued}} to improve in structure {{and with the}} formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85mph (135 km/h) that morning while centered about 75miles (120km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E

Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his head would have been.|$|E
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{data from}} the JTWC {{suggests}} that Gerimena weakened <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> southeast. Then, it turned east-southeast. On February 24, Gerimena briefly level off in intensity while turning back to south. Furthermore, the JTWC stopped {{keeping an eye on}} Gerimena at 0000 UTC on February 26 as the storm re-curved east. However, MFR continued to track Gerimena until March 4 as it fluctuated in intensity.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{official}} {{tropical cyclone}} {{of the year}} was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may have qualified for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England. The system was subsequently absorbed by a more powerful frontal boundary approaching from the northwest.|$|E
5|$|The storm quickly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} southwest, passing {{just north of}} Charters Towers City, though it continued to produce heavy rainfall over interior Queensland. Curving southeastward, Althea re-emerged over open waters between Maryborough and Double Island Point on 26 December and began to intensify once again. At 00:00 UTC on 28 December, the cyclone reached a third peak with 10-minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), but <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> more toward the south, increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures weakened the cyclone. On 29 December, Althea lost its tropical characteristics over the Tasman Sea.|$|E

He placed in the top four in all ten events, and his Olympic record of 8,413 points would stand for nearly two decades. Overall, Thorpe won eight of the 15 individual events comprising the pentathlon and decathlon.|$|E
5|$|To this day, George P. Burdell {{is listed}} as a letterman in the {{official}} media guides of two Tech sports: from 1928 to 1930 in football and 1956 to 1958 in basketball.

He was subsequently re-enrolled several times, including in 1975 and 1980.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Nine {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} wave west of Cape Verde {{on the afternoon}} of August 4, the second Cape Verde-type storm of the season. The system encountered dry air and wind shear <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> to the northwest and it broke down. Despite poor organization and shearing winds, it became Tropical Storm Irene on August 7. Further shear and dry air disrupted the cyclone's structure, and Irene was downgraded to a tropical depression on August 8.|$|E
