5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large black spot ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have <b>alternating</b> <b>light</b> and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E
25|$|Flowers often solitary and nodding, {{but some}} form umbels or have racemes with many flowers. Perianth campanulate (bell or cup shaped) and its {{segments}} usually tesselated with squares of <b>alternating</b> <b>light</b> and dark colours. Nectaries {{are large and}} well developed, and in most species (with the exception of Rhinopetalum), are linear to lanceolate or ovate and weakly impressed upon the tepals.|$|E
25|$|Chromosomes {{display a}} banded pattern when treated with some stains. Bands are <b>alternating</b> <b>light</b> and dark stripes that appear along the lengths of chromosomes. Unique banding {{patterns}} {{are used to}} identify chromosomes and to diagnose chromosomal aberrations, including chromosome breakage, loss, duplication, translocation or inverted segments. A range of different chromosome treatments produce a range of banding patterns: G-bands, R-bands, C-bands, Q-bands, T-bands and NOR-bands.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Alternate</b> <b>lighting</b> of {{surfaces}} (ALiS) is type of {{plasma display}} technology jointly developed by Fujitsu and Hitachi in 1999. <b>Alternate</b> <b>lighting</b> of surfaces uses an interlaced scanning method {{rather than a}} progressive one. This technique allows native lower resolution plasma display panels to display at higher resolutions. This technique also helps in prolonging panel life and power consumption reductions.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps 3,000 {{million years}} ago in Precambrian time, sand, limey ooze, silt and clay were {{deposited}} in a marine trough (accurate dating is not possible, due to subsequent partial recrystallization of the resulting rock). Interbeded between these layers were volcanic deposits, probably from an island arc. These sediments were later lithified into sandstones, limestones, and various shales. These rocks were 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16km) below the surface when orogenies (mountain-building episodes) around 2,800 to 2,700 {{million years ago}} intensely folded and metamorphosed them, creating <b>alternating</b> <b>light</b> and dark banded gneiss and schist. Today these rocks dominate the Teton Range with good examples easily viewable in Death Canyon and other canyons in the Teton Range. The green to black serpentine created was used by Native Americans to make bowls.|$|E
25|$|Public {{buildings}} in Mamluk Tripoli were emphasized through sitting, façade treatment, and street alignment. Well-cut and well-dressed stones (local sandstone) {{were used as}} media of construction and for decorative effects on elevations and around openings (the ablaq technique of <b>alternating</b> <b>light</b> and dark stone courses). Bearing walls were used as vertical supports. Cross vaults covered most spaces from prayer halls to closed rectangular rooms, to galleries around courtyards. Domes were constructed over conspicuous and important spaces like tomb chambers, mihrab, and covered courtyards. Typical construction details in Mamluk Tripoli included cross vaults with concave grooves meeting in octagonal openings or concave rosettes as well as simple cupolas or ribbed domes. The use of double drums and corner squinches was commonly used to make transition from square rooms to round domes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alternate</b> <b>light</b> {{sources such}} as ultraviolet, narrow band, and {{infrared}} {{have been used in}} an attempt to reveal the presence of bruising that is not otherwise apparent (inapparent). The following study evaluates the ability of <b>alternate</b> <b>light</b> sources to enhance visibility of bruises by employing an objective assessment of digital photography images in conjunction with histology. A pigskin model was employed with bruises created by injection of blood to be not visible or barely visible (inapparent) under white light. The pigskin was photographed using <b>alternate</b> <b>light</b> source illumination. Images were assessed using the program Fiji® to measure enhancement in terms of bruise length (cm). Photography results were compared with histology to confirm the presence of bruising. Violet and blue light sources produced the greatest enhancement, both with a p <  0. 0001. Regions that were not bruises were also enhanced with light sources in this study, indicating that light sources are not specific, and that their use to enhance the visibility of bruising should be undertaken with caution.

With the exception of M. fuchsi, it differs from all other Madagascarophis species by having extended contact of posterior infralabial scales. M. lolo can be distinguished from M. fuchsi by its slightly lower number of infralabial scales, with M. lolo having around 10 infralabial scales to the approximately 12-13 infralabial scales of M. fuchsi.|$|R
