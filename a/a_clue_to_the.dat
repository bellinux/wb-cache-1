5|$|The Circus {{is seen as}} the {{pinnacle}} of Wood's work. It consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games.

5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else {{would be on the}} freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who would be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E
5|$|The way {{in which}} the Vaikom Satyagraha events have been {{recorded}} provides <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> image of the respective organisers. In an article entitle Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership, Eleanor Zelliot relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to the event. Furthermore, the editor of E.V. Ramasamy's Thoughts states that Brahmins purposely suppressed news about E.V. Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, Young India, in its extensive reports on Vaikom never mentions E.V. Ramasamy.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{development}} at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder, who lived {{in one of the}} houses. The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. The most spectacular of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. All of which were designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E
5|$|The Circus {{consists}} of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three façades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile, and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, {{the style of the}} building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} places the player {{in control of}} either Jennifer or Helen, {{escaping}} from Scissorman within the university research building. The second chapter will have the player retrieve the Demon Idol, <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murder investigation. The scenario in which the idol is retrieved can change depending on choices made by the player earlier. Helen may search for it within the city library, or reporter Nolan Campbell or detective Stan Gotts will search {{for it in the}} home of a Barrows family butler. The final chapter occurs at Barrows Castle, putting the player in control of the same character they controlled in chapter one. Jennifer or Helen must use the Demon Idol to open a vortex in the castle basement and destroy Scissorman. Depending on the narrative followed and choices made along the way, 10 different endings can be seen.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Acra, critical to understanding Hellenistic Jerusalem, had {{been a matter of}} lengthy discussions. Historians and archaeologists had proposed various sites around Jerusalem, relying mainly on conclusions drawn from literary evidence. This approach began to change in the light of excavations which commenced in the late 1960s. New discoveries had prompted reassessments of the ancient literary sources, Jerusalem's geography and previously discovered artifacts. Yoram Tsafrir had interpreted a masonry joint in the southeastern corner of the Temple Mount platform as <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Acra's possible position. During Benjamin Mazar's 1968 and 1978 excavations adjacent to the south wall of the Mount, features were uncovered which may have been connected with the Acra, including barrack-like rooms and a huge cistern. In November 2015 the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the likely discovery of the Acra in a different location, south-west of the Temple Mount and north-west of the City of David.|$|E

The first contestant to reach 1,000 points advanced to the championship round while the losing contestant went home with parting gifts.|$|E
25|$|Understanding the {{activity}} of {{different parts of the}} brain during sleep can give <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> functions of sleep. It has been observed that mental activity is present during all stages of sleep, though from different regions in the brain. So, contrary to popular understanding, the brain never completely shuts down during sleep. Also, sleep intensity of a particular region is homeostatically related to the corresponding amount of activity before sleeping. The use of imaging modalities like PET and fMRI, combined with EEG recordings, gives a clue to which brain regions participate in creating the characteristic wave signals and what their functions might be.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the limited}} source materials, {{during this time}} there were efforts to {{decipher}} the newly discovered Cretan script. Australian classicist Florence Stawell published {{an interpretation of the}} Phaistos Disc in the April 1911 issue of The Burlington Magazine. She followed this with the book <b>A</b> <b>Clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cretan Scripts, published in 1931. Stawell declared all three Cretan script forms to represent early Homeric Greek, and offered her attempts at translations. Also in 1931, F. G. Gordon's Through Basque to Minoan was published by the Oxford University Press. Gordon attempted to prove a close link between the Basque language and Linear B, without lasting success.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of their}} {{literature}} {{has been lost}} or destroyed by the contemporary Christian Churches. The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Tsar Peter of Bulgaria, and {{the main source of}} doctrinal information is the work of Euthymius Zigabenus, who says that they believe that God created man's soul but matter was the invention of Satan, God's older son, who in seducing Eve lost his creative power. Concerning the Bogomils, something can be gathered from the polemic Against the Newly-Appeared Heresy of the Bogomils written in Slavonic by Cosmas the Priest, a 10th-century Bulgarian official. The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us <b>a</b> <b>clue</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their teachings. Much may also be learned from the doctrines of the numerous variations of Bogomilism which spread in Medieval Kievan Rus' after the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Remoni-Notra, of {{the planet}} Pandina, was chosen by the Zamarons to be their queen, an honor {{previously}} bequeathed upon Earth's Carol Ferris, but refused.

On Earth she took the name Deborah Camille Darnell and became a stewardess at Ferris Aircraft, in hopes of getting closer to Carol to take the Star Sapphire gem. As Star Sapphire, Darnell can use her gem of power to fly and to hurl blasts of force nearly equal to the power of a Green Lantern's ring. Moreover, the Sapphire bestows upon her a certain amount of invulnerability and allows her to survive in airless space.|$|E
