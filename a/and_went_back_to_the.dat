5|$|During a {{visit to}} Pompeii, he lost his passport, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amphitheatre he had visited {{earlier in the day}} in order to find it. Walking around the deserted ruins, he thought the silence and natural ambient sounds present would make a good {{backdrop}} for the music. He also felt that filming the band without an audience would be a good reaction to earlier films such as Woodstock and Gimme Shelter, where the films paid equal attention to performers and spectators. One of Maben's contacts at the University of Naples, a professor who was a Pink Floyd fan, managed to persuade the local authorities to close the amphitheatre for six days that October for filming.|$|E

His representation of justification by grace through faith alone was substantially from the writings and thinking of Martin Luther.

On one occasion, Rickard had to rescue his wife from angry fans who, when told the show had sold out, began rocking the small ticket booth.|$|E
25|$|The release {{method for}} April was, once again, unorthodox. In 2006, Crosby {{released}} an online {{version of the}} acoustic album online with ten tracks. April was mostly recorded only by Crosby and an acoustic guitar, with minimal use of bass and drums. After the online release, Crosby said he was unhappy with it <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio to add four new tracks and a whole new track listing. The cover featured fan-made artwork, and the album received a traditional release in stores. The album was not as well received by critics and fans, but was modestly embraced. Crosby later said that he only had it in him to do one album like April, {{and that it was}} his favorite VAST album.|$|E
25|$|He was {{involved}} in a bizarre run-out with Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the third Test against New Zealand in 2006. Morton drove the ball to mid-on where Daniel Vettori was fielding and ran to the non striker end. Chanderpaul, at the other end, initially took a few steps down the wicket but then turned <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> non-striker's end. Morton believed he was out, and, furious at his captain, began to walk off. However, following a call to the third umpire, it was decided that Morton had grounded his bat at the non-striker's end just before Chanderpaul, and hence was safe and that Chanderpaul was out. Video evidence suggests that the umpire's decision was wrong: although Morton made his ground first, he then left it before the run-out was made, so he should have been the one dismissed.|$|E

25|$|The Vytis was {{the state}} emblem of the Republic of Lithuania until 1940, when the Republic was annexed by the Soviet Union and all {{national}} insignia were outlawed. With {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the Vytis, together with the Columns of Gediminas and the national flag, became symbols of the independence movement in Lithuania. In 1988, the Vytis was legalized. On March 11, 1990 Lithuania declared its independence and restored all of its pre-war national symbols, including the historical coat of arms. On March 20, 1990 the Supreme Council of Lithuania approved the description of the State's coat of arms and determined the principal regulations for its use. The design was based on Juozas Zikaras' design that was used on all litas coins in the interwar period. This was to demonstrate that Lithuania was continuing the traditions of the State that existed between 19181940. On September 4, 1991, a new design by Arvydas Každailis was approved based on recommendations of a special heraldic committee. It abandoned romantic interwar traditions <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It re-established the original colors. However, early coins of centas still bore the old Zikaras' design until 2015.|$|E
25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Series co-creator Larry David {{wrote the}} episode, which was {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. Since {{the start of the}} show, NBC executives, especially Warren Littlefield, had been pressuring the writing staff to get Jerry and Elaine back together. Larry David had been against this idea from the start. However, brainstorming for an episode idea, he remembered he had once made a deal with a woman to have a purely physical relationship, which he thought [...] "would make a really funny show, even if they had never [...] ". Though Jerry and Elaine are still in a relationship {{at the end of the}} episode, they are no longer together by the end of the season. Seinfeld and David decided that they had satisfied the NBC executives <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original format. Seinfeld and David have also noted that [...] "The Deal" [...] is the only Seinfeld episode ever to contain sincere emotions, during the scene in which Jerry and Elaine discuss the ending of their physical relationship.|$|E

According to Keane, this was mainly {{due to the fact that}} the majority of the fairy tale takes place within a tower. To overcome this, Tangleds writers were forced to develop a way of [...] "bringing Rapunzel out of the tower". Originally, the film was conceived under the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which Keane described as [...] "a Shrek-like version of the film" [...] that revolved around an entirely different concept. Keane said of the original plot, [...] "It was a fun, wonderful, witty version and we had a couple of great writers. But in my heart of hearts I believed there was something much more sincere and genuine to get out of the story, so we set it aside <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots of the original fairy tale." ...|$|E
