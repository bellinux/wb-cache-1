The instrument used to collect data addressing sociodemographic information, clinical variables and risk factors for Risk for <b>aspiration.</b> The clinical judgments of three expert RNs were used to establish the diagnosis. The relationship between variables and strength of association using Odds Ratio (OR) was verified both in regard to Risk for <b>aspiration</b> and respiratory <b>aspiration.</b> Results: risk for <b>aspiration</b> was present in 34. 3 % of the patients and <b>aspiration</b> in 30. 5 %. The following stood out among the risk factors: Dysphagia, Impaired or absent gag reflex, Neurological disorders, and Impaired physical mobility, {{all of which were}} statistically associated with Risk for <b>aspiration.</b> Note that patients who develop such a diagnosis were seven times more likely to develop respiratory <b>aspiration.</b> Conclusion: dysphagia, Impaired or absent gag reflex were the best predictors both for Risk for <b>aspiration</b> and respiratory <b>aspiration...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aspirated fricatives {{are rare}} sounds cross-linguistically. This study {{focuses on the}} phonetic {{description}} of the aspirated coronal fricative /sh/ in Sgaw Karen. Our phonetic study found that <b>aspiration</b> in /sʰ/ is significantly shorter than <b>aspiration</b> in aspirated stops in Sgaw Karen. However, it behaves analogously to <b>aspiration</b> in stops {{in that it is}} significantly longer than in its unaspirated counterpart. Nevertheless, an important difference is found: while <b>aspiration</b> duration in stops is not affected by the height of the following vowel, <b>aspiration</b> in /sʰ/ significantly decreases as the height of the following vowel increases. Our research suggests that high vowels lengthen frication duration in /sʰ/, which then shortens <b>aspiration</b> duration. This indicates that frication and <b>aspiration</b> compete in the total segment duration, and that frication dominates <b>aspiration</b> duration. The competition between frication and <b>aspiration</b> may account for the rarity of aspirated fricatives cross-linguistically, since <b>aspiration</b> is subject to significant reduction to accommodate contexts that lengthen frication duration. When this reduction occurs, <b>aspiration</b> after Sgaw Karen fricatives in certain contexts is comparable to voice onset time of unaspirated stops, which means <b>aspiration</b> in these instances may be hard to distinguish perceptually. As a result, these aspirated fricatives {{may be more likely to}} merge with their unaspirated counterparts by losing their <b>aspiration,</b> as attested in modern Burmese...|$|R

Each patient was questioned regarding a) no unpleasant sensation (score " 0 "); b) unpleasant sensation (" 1 "); c) mild pain (no analgesic used; " 2 "); or d) pain (analgesic used; " 3 "). The mean size of the needle used was for FNAB 22. 3 ± 0. 7 or 20. 8 ± 1 gauge in the fine needle <b>aspiration</b> or fine needle <b>aspiration</b> plus large needle <b>aspiration</b> biopsy group, respectively (p<. 0001). The number of percutaneous punctures was higher in the fine needle <b>aspiration</b> plus large needle <b>aspiration</b> biopsy group. However, the pain score in the fine needle <b>aspiration</b> biopsy or fine needle <b>aspiration</b> biopsy plus large needle <b>aspiration</b> biopsy group was not significantly different.

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small <b>aspirations</b> of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small <b>aspirations</b> during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E

The patients ingested semi-solid food containing Tc- 99 m tin colloid 92. 5 MBq (2. 5 mCi) and images were acquired immediately after the ingestion and 3 hrs later. A fraction of <b>aspiration</b> to the ingested was calculated using an equation with a decay correction. Results: Five patients were interpreted positive by <b>aspiration</b> scintigraphy.
