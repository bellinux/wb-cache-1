25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken {{that most of us}} turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and {{canceled}} Megadeth's scheduled Australian tour. [...] "On the road, things escalated {{from a small}} border skirmish into a full-on raging war", Mustaine later recalled. [...] "I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were inconsistent [...] because of the guy {{we were waiting for}} after the show." [...] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he {{was having an affair with}} Mustaine's girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.|$|E
500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What would he do with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{messages}} he posted in October 2012 {{on the social}} network Twitter, regarding a discrimination claim won by a gay couple, sparked widespread opprobrium. Cambridgeshire police investigated the tweets, which included the couple's address and a suggestion that a [...] "British Justice team" [...] would give them [...] "a bit of drama", but took no further action. [...] In 2012, although he denied being [...] "anti-gay", he claimed that civil partnerships undermined [...] "the institution of marriage, {{and as a result}} of that, children will die over the next few years, because they'll be brought up in homes which aren't married". In 2009 he also said that: [...] "a lot of people find the sight of two grown men kissing in public really creepy. I understand that homosexuals don't understand that but that's how <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> [...] feel." [...] He also suggests that gay pride marches [...] " [...] on heterophobia which, like its twin Christianophobia, is on the rise." ...|$|E

500|$|His on-air {{commentary}} {{has caused}} controversy. As a commentator, Boycott has renewed his 'pull-no-punches' style {{in contrast to}} most of his fellow commentators. In particular he is known for criticising players, often in a caustic and strident style. In 2005 he mocked the Australian captain Ricky Ponting for electing to bowl first on a batsman-friendly pitch, saying he was a [...] "nice man" [...] for being so generous to the England team. In 2006, he was initially receptive to the difficulties endured by Marcus Trescothick during his periods of stress-related illness; however, he was not always as amiable. In March 2008, recently dropped Steve Harmison attacked Boycott {{in an article in}} The Mail on Sunday where he referred to Boycott as a [...] "waste of space." [...] This was in response to Boycott's statement a few days previously on 19 March 2008 that if Harmison [...] "gets a central contract this summer then <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will be screaming favouritism and a total waste of money. England should forget him".|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Sorkin {{attended}} Syracuse University. In {{his freshman}} year he failed a class that was a core requirement. It was a devastating setback {{because he wanted to}} be an actor, and the drama department did not allow students to take the stage until they completed all the core freshman classes. Determined to do better, he returned in his sophomore year, and graduated in 1983. Recalling the influence on him at college of drama teacher Arthur Storch, Sorkin recalled, after Storch's death in March 2013, that [...] "Arthur's reputation as a director, and as a disciple of Lee Strasberg, was a big reason why <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> went to [...] 'You have the capacity to be so much better than you are', he started saying to me in September of my senior year. He was still saying it in May. On the last day of classes, he said it again, and I said, 'How?', and he answered, 'Dare to fail'. I've been coming through on his admonition ever since".|$|E
500|$|Brown's acrimonious {{departure}} from Cleveland was {{another source of}} criticism. His teams' winning ways had helped obscure his harsh methods and need for control, but Modell's active involvement in the team exposed them. Despite that Modell owned the team, Brown refused to cede any authority or be diplomatic in his relationship with Modell. Modell felt Brown was unwilling {{to adapt to the}} way football was played in the early 1960s. Many players from that time agreed. [...] "Paul didn't adjust to the changes in the game", former Browns cornerback Bernie Parrish said in 1997. [...] "By 1962, he was more worried about protecting his reputation as the Greatest Coach Who Ever Lived than he was about winning a title. ... By the end of the 1962 season, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wanted to be traded because we were convinced that we'd never win a title with Paul Brown – and we never believed Paul Brown was going anywhere." [...] After his firing, Brown held a grudge against Modell {{for the rest of his}} life. He never forgave Collier for taking over as coach when he left, even though Collier had asked for and received his blessing.|$|E

The choice she made as an actress was, in playing the outsider in the Ewing family, she actually maintained somewhat of an outsider position with the cast as social equals. She didn't {{do a lot of}} the hanging out social activities that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> did because we were together so much. So in that sense, she was maybe a few percentage points removed from the swirl that was the social center of our group. At least twice a year Larry Hagman and I would go up to Canada – fishing trips, hunting trips, things like that. Steve Kanaly was included in that group, and we would go up together, and Steve and I would take other trips together. We were a group, and Linda Gray was also a member of that group. Victoria was always slightly outside and didn't participate in those things. It was her own choice and she felt it was conducive to her playing the part of Pamela. But the times we were together on the set, waiting for scenes to be shot, in the make-up room and everything, it was nothing but convivial." ...|$|E
500|$|In late June, {{the three}} Republican Representatives from Wisconsin commented on Thompson's campaign. Though Representative Tom Petri {{identified}} himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing [...] "a lot {{for the country and}} the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin" [...] he called Thompson [...] "a long shot" [...] and stopped short of endorsing him. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner described Thompson's campaign as [...] "anemic" [...] and Representative Paul Ryan commented that [...] "I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes." [...] Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to [...] "get it out of his system." [...] Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor [...] "had a profound impact" [...] on party members in Wisconsin, which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say [...] "'Oh, come on'" [...] after hearing of his run. Despite the qualms, spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants [...] "for people to give him a chance... he knows he has a lot to prove, and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it." [...] A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates, with only 6 percent support. To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour". Communications director Rennick Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital, Thompson would spend [...] "scads of time in Iowa in July." [...] He compared Thompson's strategy to Jimmy Carter's 1976 [...] "retail politics" [...] strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E

The match was played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur, which was making its debut as an international venue. Previous matches in the city were played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground and both teams were unsure how the pitch would play, as the match {{was also the first}} first-class match to be played at the stadium. Nevertheless, Ponting described said the pitch was grassless and hard as concrete. Ponting understood the importance of the match, [...] "This is probably as big a Test match as <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have played." [...] He said. [...] "Being 1–0 down with a match to play is a position that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> haven't been in before. We pride ourselves on playing well in big games, and this is certainly a big game for us.
