40|$|Vehicle {{centre of}} gravity {{influences}} directly the breaking characteristics. It dues through the actual each axle load and the <b>actual</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle. This fact is significant by full braking maneuver. Full braking measurements with different operational vehicle conditions - cargo weight and its location on the vehicle – were done to evaluate this influence. The medium sized good vehicle (category N 2) was breaking on a wet asphalt surface. The value of the braking deceleration MFDD and the braking distance was measured by vehicle decelerometer. The results compare different axle- and vehicle load and show the area for future related measurements...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft climb trajectories are {{difficult}} to predict, and large errors in these predictions reduce the potential operational benefits of some advanced features for NextGen. The algorithm described in this paper improves climb trajectory prediction accuracy by adjusting trajectory predictions based on observed track data. It utilizes rate-of-climb and airspeed measurements derived from position data to dynamically adjust the aircraft weight modeled for trajectory predictions. In simulations with weight uncertainty, the algorithm is able to adapt to within 3 percent of the <b>actual</b> <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> within two minutes of the initial adaptation. The root-mean-square of altitude errors for five-minute predictions was reduced by 73 percent. Conflict detection performance also improved, with a 15 percent reduction in missed alerts and a 10 percent reduction in false alerts. In a simulation with climb speed capture intent and weight uncertainty, the algorithm improved climb trajectory prediction accuracy by up to 30 percent and conflict detection performance, reducing missed and false alerts by up to 10 percent.

40|$|ABSTRACT Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of an Extreme Aspect Ratio HALE UAV Bryan J. Morrisey Development of High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) {{aircraft}} {{systems is}} part of a vision for a low cost communications/surveillance capability. Applications of a multi payload aircraft operating for extended periods at stratospheric altitudes span military and civil genres and support battlefield operations, communications, atmospheric or agricultural monitoring, surveillance, and other disciplines that may currently require satellite-based infrastructure. Presently, several development efforts are underway in this field, including a project sponsored by DARPA that aims at producing an aircraft that can sustain flight for multiple years and act as a pseudo-satellite. Design of this type of air vehicle represents a substantial challenge because of the vast number of engineering disciplines required for analysis, and its residence at the frontier of energy technology. The central goal of this research was the development of a multidisciplinary tool for analysis, design, and optimization of HALE UAVs, facilitating the study of a novel configuration concept. Applying design ideas stemming from a unique WWII-era project, a “pinned wing” HALE aircraft would employ self-supporting wing segments assembled into one overall flying wing. The research effort began with the creation of a multidisciplinary analysis environment comprised of analysis modules, each providing information about a specific discipline. As the modules were created, attempts were made to validate and calibrate the processes against known data, culminating in a validation study of the fully integrated MDA environment. Using the NASA / AeroVironment Helios aircraft as a basis for comparison, the included MDA environment sized a vehicle to within 5 % of the <b>actual</b> maximum <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> for generalized Helios payload and mission data. When wrapped in an optimization routine, the same integrated design environment shows potential for a 17. 3 % reduction in weight when wing thickness to chord ratio, aspect ratio, wing loading, and power to weight ratio are included as optimizer-controlled design variables. Investigation of applying the sustained day/night mission requirement and improved technology factors to the design shows that there are potential benefits associated with a segmented or pinned wing. As expected, wing structural weight is reduced, but benefits diminish as higher numbers of wing segments are considered. For an aircraft consisting of six wing segments, a maximum of 14. 2 % reduction in <b>gross</b> <b>weight</b> over an advanced technology optimal baseline is predicted...|$|R
