5|$|It was {{originally}} {{built for the}} Adobe Flash platform in 2010 as indie game artist Wohlwend's first self-developed game. The game idea came from staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and Wohlwend applied a grayscale color palette from {{his first year in}} art school. When Flash game sites did not purchase the title, he open sourced the code. Eric Johnson of Semi Secret ported the game to iPad, which began a collaboration between Wohlwend and the company's Adam Saltsman, who became the primary puzzle designer.|$|E

25|$|In the hangline approach, wood items being {{finished}} are hung by carriers or hangers {{that are}} attached to a conveyor system that moves the items overhead or above the floor space. The conveyor itself can be ceiling mounted, wall mounted or supported by floor mounts. A simple overhead conveyor system can be designed to move wood products through several wood finishing processes in a continuous loop. The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> level to speed up drying process.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis {{construct}} their nests with cells clumped {{in a single}} cluster, like bumble bee (Bombus) nests, such that it forms a globular structure rather than a comb structure. The nest chamber is approximately spherical in shape with a diameter of 13cm. The walls are lined with a dark resinous substance thick {{on the floor and}} thin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The oldest cells form the bottom layer of the nest, with new cells added on top of each layer. The larvae typically occupy the older cells with eggs in the newer cells. The inner walls of the cells are smooth, whereas the exterior is rough.|$|E

25|$|A {{practice}} {{similar to}} chilla is also performed by Hindustani classical music practitioners at an advanced level.It is called chilla katna. The musicians lock themselves up in a chilla-khana for forty days and practice their instrument severely. A special diet, often omitting meat and grains, is taken {{during this period}} and very little food is eaten. Any contact {{to the outside world}} is avoided during this period. People try not to fall asleep at any cost, if necessary they will tie their hair to a noose <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> It is done to achieve a very high level of skill, that cannot be achieved due to normal regular practice. The chilla details may differ between gharanas (musical lineages).|$|E

Lebrón claimed that she fired her shots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> while Figueroa's pistol jammed.

500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up and stare <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{in the next few days}} and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|E
500|$|Feng's {{sister-in-law}} and Deng Jiyuan's sister, Deng Jicai (...) , {{came back}} from Hubei {{the day after the}} abortion and brought a video camera with her to film Feng.

On June 11, a picture of Feng lying in a hospital bed [...] "staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with dull eyes" [...] next to the bloody corpse was posted on Chinese social media website Sina Weibo, along with an image of a threatening text message sent by authorities. The images prompted outrage, and news of the event spread quickly. [...] Angry comments from around China poured in, with people calling the authorities' actions [...] "an atrocity", [...] "the same as murder." [...] Many comments {{called for an end to}} the one-child policy, or tied the case to other controversial topics such as the corruption of local officials or the country's rural-urban divide. [...] Many posts were quickly deleted by government censors. Nonetheless, by June 13, more than 40,000 comments about the photos were present on Sina Weibo, and by June 15, images of Feng were among the most forwarded. [...] "Seven-months pregnant forced abortion" [...] was the website's top search term, and more than one million user comments were logged on the topic. Discussion also spread to other social media outlets, including NetEase, where threads critical of the government were quickly locked to prevent further discussion.|$|E

2500|$|Entropy is {{the measure}} of {{randomness}} or chaos. [...] A system has a lower entropy when there are few objects {{in the system and}} has a higher entropy when there are many objects in the system. [...] Because the process of depolymerization involves a polymer being broken down into its monomers, depolymerization increases entropy. [...] In the Gibbs free energy equation, the entropy term is negative. [...] Enthalpy drives polymerizations. [...] At low temperatures, the enthalpy term is greater than the [...] term, which allows polymerization to occur. [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> temperature, the enthalpy term and the entropy term are equal.

2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> temperature, {{there will}} always be excess {{monomers}} in the polymer due to the equilibrium between polymerization and depolymerization. [...] Polymers derived from simple vinyl monomers have such high ceiling temperatures that only a [...] amount of monomers remain in the polymer at ordinary temperatures. [...] The situation for α-methylstyrene, PhC(Me)=CH2, is an exception to this trend. [...] Its ceiling temperature is around 66 °C. Steric hindrance is significant in polymers derived from α-methylstyrene because the phenyl and methyl groups are bonded to the same carbon. [...] These steric effects in combination with stability of the tertiary benzylic α-methylstyryl radical give α-methylstyrene its relatively low ceiling temperature. [...] When a polymer has a very high ceiling temperature, it degrades via bond cleavage reactions instead of depolymerization. A similar effect explains the relatively low ceiling temperature for poly(isobutylene).|$|E
