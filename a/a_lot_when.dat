Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child.

500|$|One notable {{feature of}} the comic is the {{blending}} of mythological elements from many different cultural traditions, especially from the British Isles and Native American mythology. Siddell attributes this style to {{his experience as a}} child: [...] "I moved about <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>when</b> I was younger and had the opportunity to grow up hearing stories from {{different parts of the world}} and I've always been fascinated by them."

Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco.

But in the end, they weren't graphic or anything like that, so it was fine." [...] She continued: [...] "It was completely mental filming them. Loui and I just had a massive attack of the giggles.
