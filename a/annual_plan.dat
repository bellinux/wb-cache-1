25|$|The Practice Advisory Department (PAD) is a {{division}} of the ABCLS which exists to promote the professional competency of land surveyors, which in turn protects the public interest. The protection of the public interest is of the utmost importance to the ABCLS, as framed in the Association's Mission Statement (see above). The PAD strives to monitor the competence level of the ABCLS membership while considering the expectations of the public, government, and ABCLS members. The PAD aims to ensure that all land surveys completed in British Columbia meet a high quality of standards, and that the overall integrity of the province's cadastre is maintained. In order to achieve these goals, the PAD initiated the Practice Review Program, which consists of two primary activities: an <b>Annual</b> <b>Plan</b> Review and a Practice Review.|$|E

The {{first step is}} the <b>annual</b> <b>planning</b> to determine weeks of collection at each mobile site {{in order to ensure}} regional self-sufficiency of blood supply. The second step is the detailed weekly planning to determine days of collections at each mobile site and to form corresponding transfusion teams. Only key resource requirements are considered for <b>annual</b> <b>planning</b> while detailed resource requirements and transportation times are considered for weekly planning. Two Mixed Integer Programming models are proposed for <b>annual</b> <b>planning</b> by assuming fixed or variable mobile collection frequencies. A new donation forecast model is proposed based on population demographics, donor generosity, and donor availability. A new concept of bloodmobile collection configurations is proposed for compact and efficient mathematical modeling of weekly planning in order to minimize the total working time. Field data from the French Blood Service (EFS) in the Auvergne-Loire Region are used to design numerical experiments and to assess the efficiency of the proposed models...|$|R
