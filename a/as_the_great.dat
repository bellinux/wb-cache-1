5|$|Adult mockingbirds {{can fall}} victim to birds of prey such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> horned owl, screech owl and sharp-shinned hawk, though their {{tenacious}} behavior makes them less likely to being captured. Scrub-jays also have killed and eaten mockingbirds. Snakes rarely capture incubating females. Fledgelings have been prey to domestic cats, red-tailed hawks, and crows. Eggs and nestlings are consumed by blue jays, fish crows and American crows, red-tailed hawks, swallow-tailed kites, snakes, squirrels, and cats. Blowfly larvae and Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} Florida and Arizona populations, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Tudor (20 September 1486– 2 April 1502) was Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester and Duke of Cornwall. As {{the eldest}} son and heir {{apparent}} of Henry VII of England, Arthur was viewed by contemporaries <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> hope of the newly established House of Tudor. His mother, Elizabeth of York, {{was the daughter of}} Edward IV, and his birth cemented the union between the House of Tudor and the House of York.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression hit the United States, Fairbanks bucked {{the poor}} {{economic}} trend. Thanks to the Alaska Railroad, large gold dredges {{could be brought}} in, and these returned the area's gold mines to profitability. In 1938, Lathrop {{took advantage of the}} good economic situation by reviving the Alaska Miner as a weekly supplement to the News-Miner. The Miner covered happenings in the gold-mining camps outside Fairbanks and was focused on areas outside the city. In 1939, Fairbanks radio station KFAR was founded, and it shared the Lathrop building with the News-Miner, which occupied the bottom floors of the building.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression {{resulted}} in massive {{unemployment in the}} late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along their families and sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was {{in decline}} across the league <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression took hold. The Habs posted a losing record in 1932–33, leading to still smaller crowds. Averaging only 2,000 fans per game, the team sold Morenz to the Chicago Black Hawks in 1934 {{as part of}} an effort to cut costs. The move was not a popular one, and fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a {{standing}} ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1934–35 season.|$|E

The main stallion barn, although moved from its original location, has been preserved and restored by the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society, which is also restoring the work horse barns of the Brown Company.

5|$|Chlorine is too {{reactive}} {{to occur}} as the free element in nature but is very {{abundant in the}} form of its chloride salts. It is the twentieth most abundant element in Earth's crust and makes up 126parts per million of it, through the large deposits of chloride minerals, especially sodium chloride, that have been evaporated from water bodies. All of these pale in comparison to the reserves of chloride ions in seawater: smaller amounts at higher concentrations occur in some inland seas and underground brine wells, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Salt Lake in Utah and the Dead Sea in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Eight sacbe (causeways) {{have been}} located around Calakmul. Two {{of these have}} been mapped, three have been {{identified}} visually {{on the ground and}} three more identified with remote sensing. They have been numbered as Sacbe 1 through to Sacbe 7. The causeway network not only linked Calakmul with local satellite sites but also with more distant allies and rivals, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> cities of El Mirador, El Tintal and Nakbe. Those causeways that cross swampy land are elevated above the surrounding wetland and they now tend to support denser vegetation than the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel García Márquez's The General in His Labyrinth (El general en su laberinto, 1989) is a fictionalized {{account of}} the last days {{in the life of}} Simón Bolívar.

However the character of the General is not portrayed as the glorious hero that traditional history has presented; instead García Márquez develops a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.|$|E

When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not disembark.

5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi {{or large}} inland bodies of water such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast mode of transportation. The first steamboat to serve Baltimore was the locally built Chesapeake, constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operated by the Union Line, the boat connected with a stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's Eagle was the first steamboat to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|Issued {{four months}} into the king's accession, the charter {{expressly}} implemented an arrangement designed by Henry VIII and was confirmed by Edward Seymour, Lord Protector. Unusually for a cathedral city Norwich did not receive a cathedral school following the Reformation, but an endowed city grammar school. Norwich Cathedral {{was the first of}} the eight cathedral priories to surrender to the Crown, formally being re-established as a secular cathedral with a dean and chapter on 2 May 1538. Consequently, negotiations over the refoundation charter were between the city, rather than the cathedral, and the Crown. Known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Hospital Charter, it granted the city possession of St Giles' hospital, also called the Great Hospital, and merged the school with it in the hope of achieving an integrated system of education and poor relief. These plans were never realised, however, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Hospital was partially stripped for building materials and later sacked during Kett's Rebellion in 1549. The school temporarily occupied St Luke's House, a building north-west of the cathedral.|$|E
