40|$|Ionospheric {{scintillation}} is {{the name}} given to the disturbance caused by electron density irregularities along the propagation path of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere. These non-nominal propagation conditions mainly cause carrier phase variations and <b>amplitude</b> <b>fades.</b> It is {{important to point out}} that both degradations are correlated, and thus deep <b>amplitude</b> <b>fades</b> and rapid phase variations (the so-called canonical fades) occur in a simultaneous and random manner. Regarding the carrier synchronization problem under harsh propagation conditions, such as high dynamics, multipath effects or ionospheric scintillation, canonical fades make the latter the most challenging scenario, which can be considered as a benchmark on the performance of robust carrier tracking techniques. This phenomenon particularly affects satellite-based positioning systems in the equatorial regions and at high latitudes. In this work, both amplitude and phase variations due to scintillation are first modeled using an autoregressive (AR) model, and then included into the system state-space formulation. Therefore, a Kalman filter (KF) based solution can be aware of both dynamics and scintillation phase evolutions. This arises as the natural solution to mitigate those undesired propagation effects. Moreover, in order to counteract the main drawbacks of standard KF-based tracking solutions, an extended KF (EKF) architecture is considered, tracking both the phase dynamics, scintillation phase and amplitude. This implies directly operating with the baseband received signal's complex samples, avoiding the use discriminators and thus its saturation and the loss of Gaussianity.

30|$|In the {{frequency}} domain, the time-varying wireless channel {{is represented by}} amplitude and phase shifts on each sub-carrier and the coherence bandwidth of the channel spectrum. Coherence bandwidth is an approximate maximum bandwidth or frequency interval over which two frequencies of a signal are likely to experience comparable or correlated <b>amplitude</b> <b>fading.</b> When the coherence bandwidth is small, the signal will experience significantly different channel responses at different frequencies across a wideband channel. Therefore, to maintain orthogonality between users, we should divide the entire bandwidth into more sub-channels. When the coherence bandwidth is large, we can divide the whole bandwidth into less sub-channels to reduce the overhead introduced by the system information carrying the channel division information.|$|E

40|$|Abridged due to PUBSY {{limitations}} (see attached abstract) : GNSS-based {{studies of}} the ionosphere are typically conducted using navigation receivers which track both the carrier and code phase either on a satellite-by-satellite basis, or collectively via a vector structure [3]. Information relating to phase and amplitude scintillation is gathered from the receiver’s estimate of the carrier phase and the receiver correlators values, respectively. The quality of these parameters, however, is directly influenced by how well the receiver can track the GNSS signals. Under scintillation conditions these measurements are corrupted and degraded as the errors in the code and carrier tracking loops grow [1, 2]. Code-phase biases will manifest themselves as <b>amplitude</b> <b>fades</b> and carrier phase cycle-slips will appear as large, sudden phase fluctuations. Given such corrupted data {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish between receiver-induced artifacts and ionosphere anomalies.

The simulators of this kind will then allow researchers to observe their intentions and carry out repetitive tests to find suitable digital coding/decoding algorithms. In this paper, a simplified shallow water digital data transmission system is first introduced. The transmission channel considered here is a stochastic DSP hardware model in which signal degradations leads to a severe distortion in phase and <b>amplitude</b> (<b>fades)</b> across the bandwidth of the received signal. A computer base-band channel model with frequency non-selective feature is derived by the authors [10 - 11]. This system was based on full-raised cosine channel modelling and {{proved to be the}} most suitable for vertical and short-range underwater communication csdfher), with a reflected path (specula component, when the acoustic hydrophone receives reflected signals from surface and bottom of the sea) and a random path (diffused component, when the acoustic hydrophone receives scattered signals from the volume of the sea). The model assumed perfect transmitter-receiver synchronization but utilized realistic channel time delays, and demonstrated the time-varying characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel observed in practice. In this paper, they are used to provide a full system simulation in order to design an adaptive receiver employing the most advanced digital signal processing techniques in hardware to predict realizable error performances...|$|R
