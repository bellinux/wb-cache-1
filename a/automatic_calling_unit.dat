50|$|In normal service, the {{exchange}} automatically changed all three sections {{from one side}} to the other every eight minutes. If Call Control detected eight failures to set up calls within that eight minutes, then it force-changed all the side-conscious units onto the other side, locked that side in service and raised a prompt alarm. In periods of very low traffic, there would typically be fewer than eight call set-up attempts on {{the exchange}} in eight minutes and this would have prevented the above security system from working. The exchange was therefore provided with an <b>automatic</b> Test <b>Call</b> <b>Unit,</b> which originated a test call every 30 seconds. As well as thus enabling Call Control to detect eight failures in less than eight minutes (if all call-attempts were failing), the Test Call would raise its own prompt alarm if it detected 31 sequential call-attempt failures, indicating that neither security side of the exchange was able to connect calls.|$|R

50|$|Some {{communities}} offer {{services through}} the police departments and community organizations {{to check in}} on latchkey kids. Calls {{can be made by}} community organizations or by volunteers. <b>Automatic</b> <b>calling</b> programs such as Call Reassurance call households during the week after children arrive home and require the child to answer the phone and positively acknowledge {{that he or she is}} okay. If the call is not answered, <b>automatic</b> <b>calls</b> can likewise be sent to the parents, police, or other response centers.|$|R
50|$|Historically, call centres {{have been}} built on Private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator themselves. The PBX can provide functions such as <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution, interactive voice response, and skills-based routing.|$|R
50|$|Some {{providers}} {{achieve this}} <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> interception and callback by encoding a program onto the SIM card. For example, Smart Voyager and Piranha Mobile in the UK, airBalticcard Mobile in Latvia, UWTMobile, and MySims2Go utilise this method to forward {{the call and}} trigger the callback.|$|R

In 2005, Aspect Communications was acquired by Concerto Software for $1 bln, with the new entity called Aspect Software.|$|R

30|$|This {{approach}} does, however, {{not detect}} falls {{when the person}} continues to make substantial movements afterwards, but cannot get up. In this case, {{we assume that the}} person can trigger the SOS button manually—thus, the <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> takes place only when the person is unable to move after the fall.|$|R
50|$|An <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> {{distributor}} (ACD) is {{a communication}} system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for {{product or service}} complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).|$|R
50|$|Through the 1980s {{attention}} {{turned from}} pure hardware to software development. The BNR Toronto lab introduced Meridian Mail in the 1980s, which {{went on to}} be a very successful product and forced the introduction of similar products from other telephony vendors. They later added <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution and other similar services.|$|R
50|$|They were pioneers with {{continuously}} variable <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>called</b> Variomatic.|$|R
50|$|Most office {{telephone}} {{systems have}} some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution (ACD) groups {{which can be}} evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour. These numeric data can be entered into spreadsheets for analysis of trends.|$|R
50|$|The {{actions that}} can be {{programmed}} may include surveys, information confirmation, contact preference confirmation, or navigation through a phone menu. An example {{of the use of}} this technology is automated phone surveys, where professional polling organizations place <b>automatic</b> <b>calls</b> to conduct surveys. Respondents are provided survey questions that are answered using DTMF-tone keypad responses.|$|R
50|$|Such {{functions}} {{can include}} in-network answering machines, 800 (freephone) numbers, <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> forwarding, conference bridges {{and many other}} types of application. In integrated telephone networks, these are mostly implemented as functions in the telephone exchange, but in more open networks such as IP telephony networks based on the SIP protocol, these are often separate computers.|$|R
50|$|Some {{repeaters}} have <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> sign transmission {{at regular}} intervals and use the secondary suffix /R at the call sign's end. Some jurisdictions discourage this practice {{on the grounds that}} it could be confused with an amateur from the repeater's location working portable in Russia. Similarly, some beacon stations use the unofficial secondary suffix /B.|$|R
5000|$|The Chicxulub {{impactor}} {{produced the}} Chicxulub crater and subsequent carbonate-debris breccia, {{which became the}} oil reservoir for the fields around Villahermosa and the Bay of Campeche where the Cantarell Complex is located. [...] The porosity is 8%-12% in the reservoir {{at a depth of}} about 1500 m, which grades from being coarse-grained to fine-grained, <b>called</b> <b>Unit</b> 1 and 2 respectively, and overlain by a seal of shaly ejecta-rich layer <b>called</b> <b>Unit</b> 3.|$|R
50|$|Computer {{telephony}} integration, {{also called}} computer-telephone integration or CTI, {{is a common}} name for any technology that allows interactions on a telephone and a computer to be integrated or coordinated. The term is predominantly used to describe desktop-based interaction for helping users be more efficient, though it can also refer to server-based functionality such as <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> routing.|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} is {{most often}} found on multi-line phones found at small businesses. For <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distributor systems with high call volumes, this is usually the least preferable method, because calls will arrive at destinations {{that are in the}} process of completing the previous call, and depending on the circumstances, may be the least prepared to take the call.|$|R

5000|$|The Order {{states the}} {{specifics}} of {{what must be done}} in order to lawfully record telephone calls. Based on the 1983 version, one way to meet the requirements may be to give a verbal warning. This often occurs by the playing of a recording in an <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution queue: [...] "Your call may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance purposes." ...|$|R
50|$|Unit A {{may or may}} not <b>call</b> <b>unit</b> B. This {{integration}} has a {{complexity of}} 1, and needs two tests: one that calls B, and one that doesn't.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a zip tone is a tone an <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> {{distribution}} system makes to alert an agent {{in a call}} center environment that {{they are about to}} be connected to a customer. CIC by Interactive Intelligence calls it a whisper tone. The tone can be customized to hint at the nature of the call, so the agent can answer the call with the appropriate greeting.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is played}} out in turns between 2-8 players. Each player has a deck of {{included}} trading cards, and a fleet of playing pieces, <b>called</b> <b>units.</b> Each unit has a cost value represented by [...] "build stars". Build stars are often referred to by combat cards, objective cards, and in {{the rules of the}} game. Each unit also has four values (Attack, Damage, Defense, and Shields). Units that a player controls in the game are <b>called</b> friendly <b>units.</b> Units that the opponent controls in the game are <b>called</b> opposing <b>units.</b>|$|R
