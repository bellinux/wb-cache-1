The diagnosis is made from the clinical condition, often based on the victim being aware of a bite and ideally with identification of the spider. Laboratory tests are rarely needed {{and there is no}} specific test for the venom or latrodectism.|$|E

5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>but</b> steady flow of food that does not change much from day to day.|$|E
5|$|String theory extends {{ordinary}} {{particle physics}} by replacing zero-dimensional point particles by one-dimensional objects called strings. In the late 1980s, {{it was natural}} for theorists to attempt to formulate other extensions in which particles are replaced by two-dimensional supermembranes or by higher-dimensional objects called branes. Such objects had been considered as early as 1962 by Paul Dirac, and they were reconsidered by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>but</b> enthusiastic group of physicists in the 1980s.|$|E

They are an important object of public discourse and media representation at the national level; however, Cluj-Napoca, with its small Roma population, has not been a major focus of Roma ethno-political activity.|$|E

Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011.

Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E

Mangalore is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of population, and eighth largest port of India, providing Karnataka with access to the Arabian Sea coastline. Mangalore experienced significant growth in the decades 1970–80, with the opening of New Mangalore Port in 1974 and commissioning of Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited in 1976. Today, the Mangalore region is a nationally known higher education hub with a flourishing service sector, particularly in medical services, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>but</b> growing IT regional hub, and a booming real estate and banking industry.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16thcentury, the town became an important trading port. The town took advantage of its east coast location, which facilitated trading contacts with the Low Countries, the Baltic region, England, and Northern France. The feu-ferme charter of 1451 between the Abbot of Dunfermline and the burgesses of Kirkcaldy mentioned <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>but</b> functioning harbour; it is not known when this harbour was established, or whether it was always located {{at the mouth of the}} East Burn. According to treasurers' accounts of the early 16thcentury, timber imported via the harbour—possibly from the Baltic countries—was used at Falkland Palace and Edinburgh Castle, as well as in shipbuilding. Raw materials such as hides, wool, skins, herring, salmon, coal and salt were exported from the town until well into the 17thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Nancy (RSMC Nadi designation:09F, JTWC designation:18P) was {{the second}} {{in a series of}} four severe {{tropical}} cyclones to impact the Cook Islands during February 2005. Forming out of an area of low pressure on February10, Nancy quickly organized into <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> <b>but</b> intense, cyclone. By February14, the storm explosively intensified into a Category 4 severe tropical cyclone with winds peaking at 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935hPa (mbar). Over the following day, increasing wind shear rapidly weakened the cyclone and by February17, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before being absorbed by Cyclone Olaf.|$|E

Fox canceled the show {{at the end of its}} first and only season. In 2006, Warner Home Video released a DVD set containing all 27 episodes. The series has been remembered fondly by critics, who praise its humor and unique blend of genres.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} half of Letcher's term, the state was still {{struggling}} to recover from the financial Panic of 1837. Consistent with his Whig views, Letcher blamed the crisis on the federal government's failure to recharter the Second Bank of the United States. To ameliorate the state's dire financial situation, Letcher drastically cut spending, including the suspension of turnpike construction and improvements on the Green, Kentucky, and Licking rivers. These actions greatly reduced the state's deficit and improved its credit. In each of Letcher's years in office, the state showed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>but</b> growing budget surplus.|$|E
