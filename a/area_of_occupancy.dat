25|$|The Cape Dwarf Chameleon is {{currently}} experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation of its natural habitat through causes such as urbanization and agriculture. The historical habitat of Bradypodion pumilum has recently become severely fragmented due to intense urbanization and agricultural transformation. This trend is continuing with approximately 6.5 square kilometers of undeveloped land becoming lost to {{transformation in the}} Cape Town municipal area per year. Additional losses are expected to occur because of rapid climatic changes near Cape town {{which is where the}} species is primarily distributed. In urban areas, Cape Dwarf Chameleons are limited to planted vegetation, usually nonindigenous species, and patches of highly disturbed habitat. Populations are often found living in the overgrowth of exotic vegetation on road verges, abandoned urban ground, riverine thickets, or residential areas. Part of the species distribution lies in habitats that are protected by provincial parks, national parks, and private reserves. This protected area only amounts to 40% of the total <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> Most of the shrubland found in these protected areas are fire-prone, and natural fires are known to be detrimental to dwarf chameleon populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of range is further confounded by how the total realized range size is measured. There {{are two types}} of measurements commonly in use, the extent of occurrence (EOO) and the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> (AOO) (see also the Scaling pattern of occupancy). The EOO can best be thought of as the minimum convex polygon encompassing all known normal occurrences of a particular species, and is the measure of range most commonly found in field guides. The AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs. In essence, the AOO acknowledges that there are holes in the distribution of a species within its EOO, and attempts to correct for these vacancies. A common way to describe the AOO of a species is to divide the study region into a matrix of cells and record if the species is present in or absent from each cell. For example, in describing O–A relationships for common British birds, Quinn et al. found that the occupancy at the finest resolution (10 x 10km squares) best explained abundance patterns. In a similar manner, Zuckerberg et al. used Breeding Bird Atlas data measured on cells 5×5km to describe breeding bird occupancy in New York State.|$|E

40|$|Five {{species of}} Phebalium {{occurring}} in South Australia (P. brachyphyllum, P. equestre, P. hillebrandii, P. glandulosum subsp. glandulosum and P. lowanense) have various categories of threat ranging from Endangered to Rare. Three are endemic to South Australia, and all have rather limited, {{and in some}} cases declining <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> This study was undertaken to develop an understanding of the biology and ecology of these Phebaliums in relation to their conservation. Current population details, habitat requirements and threats were documented. Field sites were established for collection of demographic and phenological information on each species. Reproductive biology, seed dispersal mechanisms, and recruitment were studied, and ecological factors that affect sensitive life history stages (eg, weeds, grazing, fire, disturbance) were examined. Techniques for propagation of each species of Phebalium were developed using seed, cuttings and/or micropropagation.

40|$|A novel chorological data {{compilation}} {{for the main}} European tree and shrub species is presented. This dataset was produced by combining numerous and heterogeneous data collected from 20 th century atlas monographs providing complete species distribution maps, and from more recent national to regional atlases, occurrence geodatabases and scientific literature. The dataset is composed of numerous species distribution maps available in geographical information system (GIS) format, created by compiling, evaluating and synthesizing data of all collected sources. The geometry of the individual datasets describes contiguous large <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> <b>of</b> each species as polygons and fragmented or isolated occurrences as points. Since this geodatabase is intended to provide a synthetic continental-scale overview of the species ranges, the maps represent the species’ general chorology and the presence/absence information {{should not be considered}} absolute in terms of geolocation. Errors and imprecisions arising from the interpretation and digitalization processes are likely to occur, especially in those areas where detailed information is scarce.

40|$|Abstract Conservation shortcuts such as {{umbrella}} {{species have}} been long used for regional protection of species whose distributions are poorly known. Although the Euro-pean large carnivores—brown bear, gray wolf, and Eurasian lynx—might seem to be robust candidates as umbrella species, their actual effectiveness has been challenged. We used 10 -km resolution distribution maps of mammals (n = 10) and birds (n = 55) of European conservation concern in the Romanian Carpathians, and a temporal sequence of land cover maps (1990, 2000, and 2006) to examine: (1) the spatial overlap in distribution between large carnivores and bird and mammal species of conservation concern, (2) changes in forest cover for the Romanian Carpathians during the post-communist period {{in relation to the}} distribution of species, and (3) priority conservation areas using carnivores as umbrella species. Approximately 55 % of the bird and 80 % of mammals species included in this study would potentially benefit from using large carnivores as conservation sur-rogates. The changes in forest cover during 1990 – 2006 were concentrated in the Eastern Carpathians, where up to 45 % of the forest per mapping unit was clearcut during the study period.

40|$|The {{data are}} {{organized}} {{as a set}} of ESRI shapefiles (*. shp, *. shx, *. dbf, *. prj files) mapping the distribution ranges of the main European tree and shrub species. For each species and in some cases subspecies, one or more shapefiles have been created containing: a) polygon features (name suffix “plg”), which define continuous <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> <b>of</b> the species range and b) point features (name suffix “pnt”), which identify more fragmented and isolated populations. For species with reported synanthropic occurrences outside the natural range, an additional point and/or polygon shapefile has also been created (suffix “syn”). The polygon borders delimiting the range have been generalized across the mainland and sea boundaries. Clipping to a specific coastline has been avoided, as this can vary considerably in its geometry depending on scale and precision of the respective source. This offers the possibility to mask sea areas, or to clip and extract the species’ terrestrial range parts using GIS data layers of the users’ choice.

40|$|Tracking {{technology}} has revolutionized knowledge of seabird movements; yet, {{few studies have}} examined sex differences in distribution and behavior of small to medium-sized, sexually-monomorphic seabirds. Application of bird-borne geolocation-immersion loggers revealed seasonal segregation in the sexually-monomorphic Sooty Shearwater Puffinus griseus, mainly in the pre-laying period, when there were clear differences in reproductive roles. Shearwaters first returned to the Falkland Islands on 27 Sept 68 d; males, on average, 8 d earlier than females. Prior to egg-laying, distribution at sea, colony attendance and behaviour depended on sex. Males foraged locally over the southern Patagonian Shelf and Burdwood Bank, spending mainly single days at sea and intervening nights in the burrow. Females, who flew for more of the day during this time, foraged in more distant <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the northern Patagonian Shelf and Argentine Basin that were deeper, warmer and relatively more productive. Attendance of females at the colony was also more variable than that of males and, overall, males were present for significantly more of the pre-laying period (38 vs. 19 % of time). Sex differences were reduced following egg-laying, with males and females using similar foraging areas and making trips of similar mean duration in incubation (7. 662. 7 d) and chick-rearing (1. 461. 3 d). Congruence continued into the non-breeding period, with both sexes showing similar patterns <b>of</b> activity and <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> in the NW Atlantic.

30|$|Results {{indicated}} that wildcat populations remained stable in central Spain in 1997 to 2005, when the species {{was recorded in}} 46 % of survey locations. A similar pattern was found in Granada Province (southeastern Spain) in the 1990 s (Barea-Azcón et al. 2004) and in the Aragón region (northeastern Spain) between 1992 and 2006 (Sobrino et al. 2009), where wildcat populations also remained stable. Population trends can be directly assessed by changes in both AIs at the survey locations and their number with confirmed presence of the species. Thus, population densities can change while leaving the number of survey locations with wildcat presence unchanged. However, a significant variation in this number also indicates {{a change in the}} population trend. In this regard, survey locations (i.e., 1 -km trails) with species presence used in this study can be equivalent (depending on factors such as their spatial distribution and the considered scale) to <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> used in other works (e.g., IUCN 2001; Heltai et al. 2006). In the case of central Spain, results show stability in the two parameters: the average AI did not change between periods, and the number of survey locations with wildcat presence was the same. Nevertheless, to evaluate the species population trend at a national scale, more studies in other Spanish regions are needed. Moreover, population monitoring should be continued over time (Barker and Sauer 1992; Fewster et al. 2000) given that species population trends may vary concomitantly with several circumstances (e.g., Turchin 2003; Virgós et al. 2007) or differently by region (e.g., Stenseth et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|Lack {{of basic}} data to assess plant species against IUCN Red List {{criteria}} {{is a major}} impediment to assigning accurate conservation status throughout large <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the world. Erroneous assessments will be most prevalent in vast poorly surveyed areas where herbarium collections are sparse. In arid environments, assessments are further confounded by extreme temporal variability and poor {{understanding of the nature}} and magnitude of threats. We systematically re-assess the conservation status of an arid-zone flora. The status of all 1781 vascular plant species occurring across 635300 km of inland eastern Australia was initially assessed through herbarium records and expert interviews. This process generated a list of apparently rare and potentially threatened species, which guided a targeted survey program over 4 years. Search effort and key data on populations of candidate species found were recorded and used to assess 91 species against IUCN criteria. One-third of species were widespread and abundant at least in certain seasons, but had been deemed rare due to sparse collections. The conservation status of 20, mostly newly recognised species from restricted habitats, was upgraded and 14 remained listed because <b>of</b> having restricted <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy.</b> With the exception of 12 artesian spring species, continuing declines were documented for just six species. The criterion that allows for listing of species because of extreme fluctuations (in combination with restricted and fragmented populations) needs to be carefully interpreted in arid zones, where these fluctuations may be apparent rather than real, and may actually confer resilience to grazing for some species. Our approach facilitates robust conservation assessments across vast and poorly known arid regions, distinguishing species that have merely been lost in space and time from those that are at risk of extinction...|$|R

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List provides an accepted, objective framework {{for the assessment of}} extinction risk. Assessments based on data collected in the field are the best option, but the field data to base these on are often limited. Information collected through remote sensing can be used in place of field data to inform assessments. Forests are perhaps the best-studied land-cover type for use of remote-sensing data. Using an open-access 30 -m resolution map of tree cover and its change between 2000 and 2012, we assessed the extent of forest cover and loss within the distributions of 11, 186 forest-dependent amphibians, birds, and mammals worldwide. For 16 species, forest loss resulted in an elevated extinction risk under red-list criterion A, owing to inferred rapid population declines. This number increased to 23 when data-deficient species (i. e., those with insufficient information for evaluation) were included. Under red-list criterion B 2, 484 species (855 when data-deficient species were included) were considered at elevated extinction risk, owing to restricted <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> resulting from little forest cover remaining within their ranges.

Mapping the precise distributions and assessing the conservation status of reptiles is the first step towards effective conservation. Presence/absence and abundance data were gathered from extensive fieldwork and post- 1980 literature. Evaluation of conservation status was considered at specific and subspecific levels, following IUCN Red List criteria and using RAMAS. Fieldwork confirmed the occurrence of 34 of 37 previously recorded taxa (31 native, three exotic). One taxon continues to be considered Extinct. Three broad distribution and rarity patterns were identified: widespread and abundant taxa occurring on â‰¥ 2 islands/islets, widespread or abundant taxa restricted to one island, and rare or limited range taxa occurring on small <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> islands or islets. More than a third <b>of</b> taxa have <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupancy</b> < 20 km 2 and extents of occurrence < 100 km 2. Geckos are rarer than skinks because of their high habitat specialization, with 58 % occurring on only one island/islet. About half of all taxa are potentially threatened, twice the proportion of those in the Canary Islands, a difference that could be explained by the smaller area and greater aridity of the Cape Verde islands. The criterion used for most threat categorizations is geographical range, and the most pervasive threats are natural disasters, intrinsic factors of the species and introduced species. The importance of applying conservation status at the subspecific level to island endemics is emphasized.
