60|$|He {{released}} her wrist, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in the uncertain light.|$|E
60|$|He only stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> fascinated. His soul {{seemed to}} melt.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Layard started <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> Evidently this lady's {{imagination}} was as vivid {{as it was}} suggestive.|$|E
60|$|Caesar, quite dumbfounded by this impertinence, {{turns in}} his chair <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{the speech}} continues, the scene briefly {{moves to the}} Demetrius, where Starbuck has fallen asleep atop her {{navigation}} charts. A concerned Samuel Anders enters the room <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|GRACE. Yes, Leonard; but I'm an {{advanced}} woman. (He checks himself and looks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in some consternation.) I'm {{what my father}} calls a New Woman. (He lets <b>her</b> go <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.)</b> I quite agree with all your ideas.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Davis {{passed the}} back of his hand across his eyes in a dazed fashion <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He did {{not take}} her hand, but stood stock still {{in the middle of}} the path <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She saw {{the relief}} deepen {{in his face}} and {{suddenly}} laughed. He got up from his knees <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Truth is truth, though she's my daughter," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Rose, vaguely. [...] "She's too good-looking. Sometimes when I've {{taken her}} up to market I've seen the folks fair turn their backs on the cattle <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> instead." ...|$|R
5000|$|... sisko (fatty): She was so {{fat that}} {{wherever}} she went, people would stop {{whatever they were}} doing <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> The way people looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> made her so uncomfortable that she would eat even more and become even fatter. (P242 The Gaze) ...|$|R
6000|$|LILY--[Uncertainly.] Perhaps I shouldn't have. It's not my secret. [Enjoying herself immensely {{now that}} she holds the spotlight--after a pause, in a stage whisper.] Shall I tell you? Yes, I can't help telling. Well, Martha {{is going to have}} a son. [They are all stunned <b>and</b> flabbergasted <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> speechlessly.] ...|$|R
60|$|Fort {{struggled}} up, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> His {{face was}} comic from bewilderment, and she {{broke into a}} little nervous laugh.|$|E
60|$|He drew {{himself up}} with a sharp catch in his breath, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as if he saw a ghost.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Piper, giving {{utterance}} to uncouth noises, quitted {{the room}} hastily, but Mr. Cox sat still <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dumbly.|$|E
60|$|EMILY--John {{just came}} in from the garden. [Turning around to where JOHN is dozing in his chair--sharply.] John! Well I never! If he isn't falling asleep! John! [He jerks up his head <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{blinking}} stupidly. She continues irritably.] A nice time to pick out for a nap, I must say.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Coup," [...] when Pam, at Kelly's insistence, wears a {{slightly}} more revealing shirt than is usual, Creed comes to <b>her</b> desk <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for an awkwardly long time. When she asks him what he wants, {{he says that he}} is [...] "just looking." [...] When she asks him to go away, he says [...] "in a minute." ...|$|R
60|$|The light still {{remaining}} in the sky lit up her face, though the landscape was nearly dark. The man turned <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{recovered}} {{himself a}} little, {{but he was}} still incapable of speech. He held fast by the fence, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|That answer smote him {{instantly}} still. Under {{the shock}} of it he just stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> again, his jaw fallen.|$|E
60|$|Quiet in the {{extremity}} of his disturbance, Mr. Treffry {{leaned forward}} in his chair, rested his big hands on its arms, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him slowly. His face turned a little pale, <b>and</b> he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> blankly, like a deaf-and-dumb man who was {{wondering}} what it was all about.|$|R
60|$|That {{checked his}} wildness. It brought {{him up with}} a round turn. His jaw fell, <b>and</b> he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> lost now for words. Of this she took the fullest advantage.|$|R
60|$|Thus the pent-up {{hate and}} {{bitterness}} {{of years of}} brooding upon her wrongs broke forth. Taken aback, he quailed before it. His jaw dropped foolishly, <b>and</b> he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with wide, unblinking eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Conant stood <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{his hands}} clasped {{behind his back}} in {{characteristic}} attitude. He could not remember ever having heard of Sarah Judd.|$|E
60|$|He stopped {{like a man}} who {{had been}} struck, straightened, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> as though he had not taken her meaning. Then he swung on me.|$|E
60|$|Susan, {{drawing in}} her head from the window, thrust it out again, drew it in again as the {{carriage}} stopped, <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mistress in amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ow!" [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "It is the White Maiden. Now how came she here? Surely {{this is great}} magic. Can a woman fly like a bird?" [...] <b>and</b> they <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> amazed.|$|R
60|$|Lilian, rising, {{stood in}} the open window, <b>and</b> the speaker <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> in astonishment.|$|R
60|$|The {{head was}} lifted for a moment, <b>and</b> the eyes <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with {{wondering}} joy.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid down}} his {{newspaper}} <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> helplessly, {{with the air}} of a man who suddenly finds himself at sea in a small boat without oars.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of this soft voice (the extreme {{softness}} of Maqueda's voice was always one of her greatest charms), Orme opened his eyes <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Betty {{told the}} parrot she {{understood}} his language, {{and he was}} so surprised that he got on his perch at once <b>and</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> as he said eagerly,-- ...|$|E
50|$|Alton {{returns to}} his cell after meeting the family of his victims. He reveals to Seward that the {{visitors}} were his brother and sister and that his victims were his parents. He says his siblings told him they've forgiven him. Danette slowly drives down the city streets looking for Kallie. She calls her daughter and leaves a voicemail. She later meets Mills in a motel room. As he showers, she calls Kallie again. Drawn {{by the sound of}} ringing close by, she discovers Kallie's phone inside Mills' bag. He exits the bathroom <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jaime and Isa {{go to the}} {{basement}} and release Marta and César, who have been handcuffed together. Jaime gives the gun to Marta, then calls the police; while {{he is on the}} phone, Head Thief returns to the house and kills him with the sledgehammer. Marta tries to shoot Head Thief, but misses. He takes the gun from her and shoots her in the head. César comes up from {{the basement}} and Head Thief kills him too. Isa falls to <b>her</b> knees <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother in shock while he stabs her repeatedly in the stomach.|$|R
5000|$|Zombies then {{break into}} the mansion and attack the guests in the library. One of the guests, the young Michael (Peter Bark) has become traumatized, and his mother Evelyn (Mariangela Giordano) tries comforting him in another room. Michael, however, seems to be {{becoming}} sexually attracted to his mother, and fondles her breasts while kissing her. Evelyn slaps him, and he runs off, screaming [...] "What's wrong?! I'm your son!" [...] Michael then encounters the now-zombified Leslie (Antonella Antinori), another guest, and stands still <b>and</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> while she shambles towards him, snarling and covered in blood.|$|R
