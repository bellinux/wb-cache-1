The residual stresses in the <b>assembled</b> <b>tube</b> were very comprehensive after lasers braze fusion welding, not only including the welding residual stresses, but also the initial stresses from over fitting. Both of the dimension and strength were affected by the complex residual stress distribution in the <b>assembled</b> <b>tube.</b> MSC. MARC software was used to simulate the stress fields during lasers braze fusion welding of the <b>assembled</b> <b>tube.</b> The stress fields during lasers braze fusion welding and the residual stresses after welding have been obtained, {{and the effect of}} over fitting on welding residual stress of the <b>assembled</b> <b>tube</b> have also been studied. The residual stresses at outer surface of the <b>assembled</b> <b>tube</b> have been measured by the X-ray diffraction method.

Since a magazine for fittings is integrated {{in the assembly}} device, and the tube {{in the form of}} an endless tube is fed to the gripper jaws of the assembly device and can be separated at the required length by means of a separating device, the tube can be fully assembled in one work step by one single tool. As a result, the tube connection can be simply positioned and secured in its position without difficulty. This step is performed fully automatically by one single tool after the tube jointing process.

40|$|Based on the {{experience}} gained with the inverse magnetron injection gun (IMIG) for coaxial cavity gyrotrons, a new 4. 5 MW electron gun for operation at a cathode voltage of 90 kV and a beam current of 50 A has been designed and is currently under fabrication at Thomson Tubes Electroniques (TTE). The gun is of the diode type. Different from the LaB_ 6 IMIG currently used, the emission of the electrons will not be directed towards the coaxial insert but towards the anode similar like in conventional MIG gyrotron electron guns. The inner conductor is supported from the gun inner conductor side and can be aligned in a reproducible way in the fully <b>assembled</b> <b>tube.</b> The insert is cooled as required for operation at long pulses up to cw. The cathode will be equipped with an impregnated tungsten matrix emitter as used in industrial tubes. A 160 / 170 GHz, 1. 5 MW, 100 ms pulse length coaxial gyrotron employing the new electron gun and a single-stage depressed collector has been designed. The advanced quasi-optical converter for transforming the TE_-_ 3 _ 1 _,_ 1 _ 7 cavity mode at 165 GHz into a single RF-output wave beam (only one output window) consists of a simple launcher and two mirrors. The first mirror is quasi-elliptical and the second mirror has a non-quadratic phase-correcting surface to generate an approximately homogeneous RF-field distribution with a high fundamental Gaussian content in the window plane. First test experiments with the new gyrotron have been performed employing the available LaB_ 6 -IMIG. (orig.) 10 refs.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the author’s {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} the Ring Imaging Cherenkov(RICH) detectors in the LHCb experiment due to take data at the CERN Large Hadron Collider in 2007. The first chapter summarises the physics to be explored by the LHCb experiment; measurements of CP violating asymmetries and a study of rare B decay modes. A brief overview of other experiments studying B-physics is presented. The experiment itself is then described, focussing on the RICH system used for particle identification, with particular emphasis on the photondetectors. The thesis then {{reports on the}} work done by the author on the design of the RICH 1 Magnetic Shield, that allows the photon detectors to operate in the fringe field of the LHCb dipole magnet, while fulfilling the conflicting requirement to provide additional magnetic bending power to aid the LHCb charged particle trigger. The design of all of the many sections of the shield are described in depth and the results of finite element simulations performed by the author are reported. The results of measurements the author took of the field produced by the completed magnetic shield are then evaluated and compared with the simulation. Next follows a study undertaken by the author on the electronic readout of the RICH Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPD). Two related mesurments were made, a novel series of timing tests on the HPD’s analogue readout in an <b>assembled</b> <b>tube</b> and a series of experiments using a pulsed laser to simulate the charge deposition of a photoelectron. The final part of the thesis describes the analysis of data taken in a charged particle beam studying the Cherenkov photon yield seen with a teest RICH system and the prototype HPD electronics chain.

40|$|Bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ assembles {{straight}} protofilaments (pfs) {{that form}} the scaffold of the cytokinetic Z ring. These pfs can adopt a curved conformation forming a miniring or spiral tube 24 nm in diameter. Tubulin pfs also have a curved conformation, forming 42 nm tubulin rings. We have previously provided evidence that FtsZ generates a constriction force by switching from straight pfs to the curved conformation, generating a bending force on the membrane. In the simplest model the membrane tether, which exits from the C terminus of the globular FtsZ, {{would have to be}} on the outside of the curved pf. However, it is well established that tubulin rings have the C terminus on the inside of the ring. Could FtsZ and tubulin rings have the opposite curvature? In the present study we explored the direction of curvature of FtsZ rings by fusing large protein tags to the N or C terminus of the FtsZ globular domain. FtsZ with a protein tag on the N terminus did not <b>assemble</b> <b>tubes.</b> This was expected if the N terminus is on the inside, because the protein tags are too big to fit in the interior of the tube. FtsZ with C-terminal tags <b>assembled</b> normal <b>tubes,</b> consistent with the C terminus on the outside. The FN extension was not visible in negative stain, but thin section EM gave definitive evidence that the C-terminal tag was on the outside of the tubes. This has interesting implications for the evolution of tubulin. It seems likely that tubulin began with the curvature of FtsZ, which would have resulted in pfs curving toward the interior of a disassembling MT. Evolution not only eliminated this undesirable curvature, but managed to reverse direction to produce the outward curving rings, which is useful for pulling chromosomes. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|Biological and {{engineering}} studies of Hess-Murray’s law {{are focused on}} assemblies of tubes with impermeable walls. Blood vessels and airways have permeable walls to allow the exchange of fluid and other dissolved substances with tissues. Should Hess-Murray’s law hold for bifurcating systems in which {{the walls of the}} vessels are permeable to fluid? This paper investigates the fluid flow in a porous-walled T-shaped assembly of vessels. Fluid flow in this branching flow structure is studied numerically to predict the configuration that provides greater access to the flow. Our findings indicate, among other results, that an asymmetric flow (i. e., breaking the symmetry of the flow distribution) may occur in this symmetrical dichotomous system. To derive expressions for the optimum branching sizes, the hydraulic resistance of the branched system is computed. Here we show the T-shaped assembly of vessels is only conforming to Hess-Murray’s law optimum {{as long as they have}} impervious walls. Findings also indicate that the optimum relationship between the sizes of parent and daughter tubes depends on the wall permeability of the <b>assembled</b> <b>tubes.</b> Our results agree with analytical results obtained from a variety of sources and provide new insights into the dynamics within the assembly of vessels...|$|R

40|$|Publicado em "Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine", vol. 7, supp. 1 (2013) A major {{limitation}} {{in generating}} materials using bottom-up strategies {{is the lack}} of order at the macroscale. In this work, we show that two self-assembling molecules, an elastin-like polymer (ELP) and a peptide amphiphile (PA), can interact to spontaneously to form hierarchically ordered, dynamic, bioactive, macrotubes. An RGD-containing ELP and a PA (C 16 V 3 A 3 K 3) were synthesised using standard methods. The addition of PA solution into ELP instigated the formation of a hollow tube that expanded from the lower surface up to the air-liquid inter- face. The tubes were prepared at different pH values, and tempera- tures. Tubular macrostructures were formed when the zeta potential of the ELP was negative, i. e., above pH 5. 5, indicating that an electrostatic interaction is involved in the assembly of the two molecules. When tubes prepared at RT were placed at 4 °C, they became less opaque, suggesting that there is also a temperature-dependent interaction between the two molecules. Continuous assembly for 48 h enabled the formation of strong structures that could easily be manipulated with tweezers and were stable in PBS at 37 °C. SEM images of the tubular structures showed that they were composed of a nanofibrous mem- brane, about 20 lm thick. When two <b>tubes</b> were <b>assembled</b> next to each other, they spontaneously fused into a larger <b>tube.</b> These self- <b>assembled</b> <b>tubes,</b> which show dynamic and temperature-dependent behavior have great potential for use in regenerative medicine applications...|$|R

40|$|Over {{its history}} {{electromagnetic}} forming (EMF) has probably seen {{far and away}} more application in <b>assembling</b> <b>tubes</b> or rings onto (or into) nominally axisymmetric mating elements. The vast majority of these assemblies does not require any significant structural integrity or strength. However, {{a small fraction of}} these are designed and fabricated for mechanically-demanding applications. There are two key factors (which seem to be largely independent) that are key in the design and performance of a crimpedelectromagnetic tube joint. First is the state of residual stress that exists after the crimped joint is created. A natural interference fit seems to be a fairly general feature of EMF crimp joints. This interference gives a backlash-free joint that will not fret. The second key issue is the configuration of the joint. The fabrication of designed interlocking geometries is required to create a joint that maximizes mechanical strength while minimizing the electromagnetic energy and forces required to create it. Both of these issues will be considered here. Here we consider crimping onto textured surfaces such as screw threads and knurls. We show experimentally that approaches of this type can give joints that exceed the strength of the tube both in torsion and axial loading. Analysis methods based on coupling impact-indentation and break-before-strip criteria can be used to compare joints made in this way with those based on the more traditional large scale deformation of the tube. One of the advantages of forming onto 'textured' surfaces is that a number of small pulses (possibly generated by small and inexpensive capacitor banks) can be used to create a joint that has the strength of the parent tube, without any heat affected zones or distortion. Again, the natural interference fit developed by impact eliminates the potential for fretting...|$|R

Vasculogenesis describes the initial proliferation and differentiation of early embryonic cells to form blood vessels. From there, additional growth and movement of endothelial cells from pre-existing blood vessels {{is referred to}} as angiogenesis. This project was designed to isolate primary quail endothelial cells from early embryos and to establish a three-dimensional system to study the ability of the cells to <b>assemble</b> into <b>tube</b> networks. The long-term goal {{of this study is to}} develop a new in vitro endothelial morphogenesis system where both in vitro and in vivo results can be directly correlated. First, we isolated the quail chorioallantoic membrane at embryonic day five and digested the tissue with a combination of collagenase and trypsin. We removed debris and then added the cell suspension to dishes in the presence of endothelial cell growth medium. We allowed the cell population to proliferate for about one week and after this time, cell suspensions were incubated on dishes coated with QH 1 antibody, which recognizes a quail endothelial cell specific antigen. This allowed us to selectively capture the endothelial cells, as they adhere to the antibody-coated dish. We then grew them in culture for a period of time to expand them. After expansion of the cells, they were examined for expression of CD 31 and QH 1 to prove that they were strongly enriched for endothelial cells. Using these quail endothelial cells, we suspended them in three-dimensional collagen gels with a cytokine mixture and assayed for their ability to <b>assemble</b> into <b>tubes.</b> We show that this endothelial cell population is able to form tube networks, further suggesting their endothelial origin...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Major {{coronary}} vessels {{derive from}} the proepicardium, the cellular progenitor of the epicardium, coronary endothelium, and coronary smooth muscle cells (CoSMCs). CoSMCs are delayed in their differentiation relative to coronary endothelial cells (CoEs), such that CoSMCs mature only after CoEs have <b>assembled</b> into <b>tubes.</b> The mechanisms underlying this sequential CoE/CoSMC differentiation are unknown. Retinoic acid (RA) is crucial for vascular development and the main RA-synthesizing enzyme is progressively lost from epicardially derived cells as they differentiate into blood vessel types. In parallel, myocardial vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression also decreases along coronary vessel muscularization. Objective: We hypothesized that RA and VEGF act coordinately as physiological brakes to CoSMC differentiation. Methods and Results: In vitro assays (proepicardial cultures, cocultures, and RALDH 2 [retinaldehyde dehydrogenase- 2]/VEGF adenoviral overexpression) and in vivo inhibition of RA synthesis show that RA and VEGF act as repressors of CoSMC differentiation, whereas VEGF biases epicardially derived cell differentiation toward the endothelial phenotype. Conclusion: Experiments support a model in which early high levels of RA and VEGF prevent CoSMC differentiation from epicardially derived cells before RA and VEGF levels decline as an extensive endothelial network is established.

The column {{is composed of}} a number of rectifier <b>tubes,</b> <b>assembled</b> in cascades. Semi-circular corona rings are attached to the anode and cathode of each rectifier in the cascade. Two rf electrodes are mounted near the inner surface of the tank. This circuit, with a resonance frequency around 100 kHz, is coupled inductively with an oscillator. Because of its high power, the oscillator sits in a separate tank. Parallel coupling of the cascade to the liners is accomplished through the electrode to corona ring capacitance. The main advantage of this parallel coupling design is that it allows a much higher beam current to be transported than a typical Cockcroft-Walton style accelerator.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to analyzing DNA-based algorithms in molecular computation. Such protocols are characterized abstractly by: encoding, tube operations and extraction. Implementation of these approaches, involves encoding a multiset of molecules that are <b>assembled</b> in a <b>tube</b> having a number of physical attributes. The physico-chemical state of a tube can be changed by a prescribed number of elementary operations. Based on realistic definitions of these elementary operations, we define complexity of a DNA-based algorithm using the physico-chemical property of each operation. We show that new algorithms for hamiltonian path are about twice as efficient as Adleman 's original one and that a recent algorithm for max-clique provides a similar increase in efficiency. Consequences of this approach to tube complexity and DNA Computing are discussed. Key Words: Molecular computation, DNA-based algorithm, complexity, computational efficiency.

50|$|Pedersen {{wrote that}} he {{developed}} the hammock style seat first. It provides suspension from road imperfections with much less weight, 4 oz instead of 3 lb of traditional leather and steel spring saddles of the day. Pedersen then developed a frame, a truss assembled from several thin tubes, around his new seat design. He attributed his inspiration to the Whipple-Murphy bridge truss. The design initially did not support seat height adjustment, and even after some adjustability was added, required the manufacture of eight different sizes. The non-standard frame design would not accommodate a traditional front fork. Instead, Pedersen developed a fork that also consisted of thin <b>tubes</b> <b>assembled</b> into a truss, which {{was attached to the}} frame with bearings at two distinct points, instead of through a traditional head tube. Pedersen also received patents for a chainwheel and bottom bracket combination and lightweight pedals.|$|R
