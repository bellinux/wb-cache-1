25|$|Characteristic of its type, the Kore of Lyons is a pentelic marble {{sculpture}} measuring 64cm in height, 36cm {{wide and}} 24cm deep. It depicts the bust of a majestic young woman, who holds an offering against her breast, a bird, identified {{by some as}} a dove. The sculpture was painted. Influenced by the art of the Ionian coast, it is dressed in a chiton and himation. She wears a polos <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> head and earrings.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} depictions, Athena {{is usually}} portrayed standing upright, wearing a full-length chiton.

Her shield bears at its centre the aegis {{with the head of}} the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in Phidias's famous lost gold and ivory statue of her, 36 m tall, the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon.|$|E

Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E

500|$|In 1917, {{fire control}} {{directors}} were installed, and she received flying off platforms <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> forward superfiring and amidships turrets. After {{the end of}} the war, Erin was assigned to the Nore Reserve and served as its flagship. Her postwar career was cut short by the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922, which mandated significant draw downs in naval strength for the signatories. The Royal Navy had originally intended to keep Erin as a training ship {{under the terms of the}} treaty, but a change of plans led to [...] taking her place as the training ship, which meant that Erin had to be scrapped. The ship was sold for scrap in December 1922, and subsequently broken up by the ship breaking firm Cox and Daniels, which finished scrapping Reşadiye in 1923.|$|E
500|$|Arizonas last fleet {{problem was}} off Hawaii in April–May 1940. At its conclusion, the United States Pacific Fleet was {{retained}} in Hawaiian waters, based at Pearl Harbor, {{to deter the}} Japanese. She was overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, from October 1940 to January 1941. During this refit, her anti-aircraft armament was increased to twelve 5-inch guns, {{the foundation for a}} search radar was added <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> foremast, her anti-aircraft directors were upgraded and a platform for four water-cooled [...] caliber M2 Browning machine guns was installed {{at the very top of}} the mainmast. Her last flag change-of-command occurred on 23 January 1941, when Willson was relieved by Isaac Kidd, by that time a rear admiral. Captain Harold C.

500|$|The main {{set list}} for the {{residency}} included songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. The show began with Gaga appearing {{on top of the}} platforms and danced towards her piano to perform an acoustic version of [...] "Born This Way", before proceeding to dance on the rafters with her backup troupe to [...] "Black Jesus + Amen Fashion" [...] in her purple leotard and jacket. A costume change ensued and Gaga performed [...] "Monster" [...] wearing a crimson leather body suit and roses <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> head. She played the rose-adorned keytar and gradually segued into [...] "Bad Romance". Middle of the performance, she ran {{to the left of the}} stage to climb a ladder to the mezannine floors, where she sang the final chorus and [...] "Sexxx Dreams" [...] followed with energetic dance moves.|$|E

500|$|Produced by Cool & Dre, {{the song}} was {{recorded}} at Allido Sound Studios in New York, by Derek Pacuk, while the mixing was done by Serban Ghanea. Wale recalled in a 2011 interview with MTV News for Lady Gaga: Inside the Outside special, that the recording session did not go easy. He had traveled to the New York recording studio from Washington D.C. after a long night of partying. Gaga {{was already in the}} studio in her exuberant style with a big ribbon <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> head by which Wale was taken aback, and was a [...] "cultural difference" [...] for him. In an effort to warm up to each other they made small talk about their respective record deals with Interscope. By the end of the session, Gaga had created five different hooks for [...] "Chillin" [...] and added her vocals on the track. The rapper added, [...] "It took a while. Once we finally got the ball rolling, it was almost time to go. It was natural though. It's wack when you get in the studio with somebody and it's automatically music time— it feels fake. We were trying to feel each other out." [...] Wale later added {{that he would like to}} collaborate with Gaga again on a track but it was unknown to him if Gaga would be interested.|$|E
500|$|The {{section was}} {{followed}} by a video interlude featuring snarling dogs and brooding ravens. The performance of [...] "Monster" [...] began with Gaga emerging in a black feathered jacket and performing dance moves reminiscent of Michael Jackson as the backdrops featured a black bird's wings. She continued with two songs from The Fame Monster titled [...] "So Happy I Could Die" [...] and [...] "Teeth", after which she removed the feathered dress. Gaga then started performing the song [...] "Speechless" [...] on piano, and continued with an acoustic version of [...] "Poker Face". Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song [...] "Make Her Say" [...] which contains a sample of [...] "Poker Face". This segment {{was followed by}} the performance of [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "The Fame", during which Gaga wore a gold Egyptian styled crown and matching body suit, compared to the garment of a viking. Gaga crawled <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> piano during the follow-up songs [...] "The Fame" [...] and [...] "Money Honey", after which she returned to the stage, dressed in black vinyl and nearly nude in a red patent leather bikini, to perform [...] "Boys Boys Boys", backed by a squadron of skinny and shirtless leather boys. During [...] "Poker Face", she wore a bondage inspired black leather dress with guns hanging from it and a hat made of muzzles, and pumped her hands in the air while performing the song. This was followed by Gaga sitting on a dentist's chair and spreading her legs during [...] "Paper Gangsta". Another video interlude followed, displaying arty poses of Gaga in gothic looks.|$|E
500|$|As {{the guitar}} intro of [...] "Gambler" [...] started, Madonna {{stood on the}} side-stage and started dancing energetically, as {{flashlights}} fell on her. While singing the song, she sometimes opened her jacket and sometimes straddled a steel structure present {{on the side of}} the stage. The performance ended with Madonna jumping off the side stage, onto the main one. She then performed [...] "Borderline", [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Crazy for You"—while touching the hands of the audience members. Madonna then returned to the microphone and started singing [...] "Over and Over" [...] from Like a Virgin. It was followed by [...] "Burning Up" [...] during which she caressed one of the guitarist, ultimately disappearing for another constume change. As the music of the song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] started, Madonna returned on the stage, wearing a wedding dress, holding a bouquet in her hand and a long white veil behind her. Accessorized by a white bow <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> head and lacy, three-quarter length gloves, she also had a crucifix on her waistband and another hanging from a long chain around her neck. Madonna asked the audience [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] When the audience answered affirmatively, she threw the bouquet towards them and started singing the song. Madonna continued singing the song while rolling around the floor, and added a snippet of Michael Jackson's Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience again as she pulled apart her veil and threw it towards the audience. She returned to the stage in the arms of one of the backup dancers, wearing a boob tube and a tight white skirt, carrying a bunch of notes in her left hand, and a number of garlands around her neck. In a self-parodying performance of the song [...] "Material Girl", at the end of the performance Madonna asked the audience [...] "Do you really think I'm a material girl?... I'm not... Take it ... I don't need money... I need love." [...] As she began to strip off more clothes and jewelry, she was apprehended and marched offstage by an extra posing as her father. In Detroit, her father Tony Ciccone himself did the honors. The show ended with Madonna returning onstage once more to take her fur coat and doing a curtsey.|$|E

In September and October 1990, there was the addition of two decks <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> superstructure, adding 135 new suites and luxury cabins. While many ship aficionados believe the new decks spoiled her original clean, classic lines, the new private veranda cabins on the added decks were instrumental in keeping the Norway financially afloat during the later years of her operation, as these became a common feature throughout the cruise industry. She received additional refits in 1993 and 1996 in order to comply with the new SOLAS (Safety of Life At Sea) regulations.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1972 Taney was shifted back to {{the east}} coast and was homeported at Norfolk. From 13 to 22 October 1972 she served on Ocean Station Hotel. From 28 October to 17 November 1972 she served on Ocean Station Delta. From 26 January to 15 February and 17 April to 7 May 1973 she served on Ocean Station Bravo. As the ocean {{stations}} were decommissioned during the early 1970s due to advances in radar and electronic navigation, Taney was assigned exclusively to the only station still operational: Ocean Station Hotel off the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. Fitted with a special storm-tracking antenna housed in a distinctive bulbous dome fitted <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> pilot house, Taney deployed seven times yearly, conducting 21 deployments [...] off the coast. This last ocean station had been established to track storms threatening the middle states {{on the east coast}} which had often struck without warning. Eventually, the use of more sophisticated storm-tracking satellites and radars rendered this station obsolete. Hence, Ocean Station Hotel was closed down in 1977 and the Taney gained the distinction of being the last Coast Guard cutter to serve on an ocean station.|$|E
2500|$|Liberty is a [...] tall statue made of Carrara marble which symbolizes {{liberty in}} the form of a young woman with {{idealized}} features. She stands with legs slightly apart and her proper left foot positioned in front of her body, while her proper right foot points away from her body at an approximately 45° angle. She wears a Hellenistic tunic which is pinned at each shoulder, exposing both arms and draping across her bust. The upper part of the tunic has slipped down on her proper right, exposing her shoulder. The tunic is cinched at the waist and falls in folds to her sandaled feet. Liberty is wrapped in a mantle, and gathers its folds at waist height in her proper left hand. Her proper right arm is extended towards the ground and positioned close to her body. Her proper right hand holds a long sword, the point of which rests on the base in between her feet. Liberty wears a Phrygian cap <b>atop</b> <b>her</b> hair, which is tied back at the base of her neck.

Presently, as the sustaining centrifugal force lessened and failed, she began to sway and wabble from side to side, and finally, toppling over on her side, rolled convulsively on her back and lay motionless with all her feet in the air, honestly believing that the world had somehow got <b>atop</b> of <b>her</b> and she was supporting it at a great sacrifice of personal comfort.
