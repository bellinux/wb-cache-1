5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole.

All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however.

5|$|A banqueting {{house was}} built just inside the {{south-west}} corner of the moat. Though it was probably built in the 16th century, it was in <b>a</b> <b>dilapidated</b> state by 1577.

Wetland areas south and east of the castle may have been used to emulate a mere, a type of broad shallow lake. As well as this, there were two fishponds, but their dating is uncertain. During Wressle Castle’s heyday in the 16th century, the quality of the gardens and ornamental landscape would have paralleled the interior of the renovated buildings, possibly even rivalling gardens at royal properties.|$|E

The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals {{had been living in}} it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later. According to director Lonnie Bunch III, it is an artifact with the potential to stop future visitors and make them think.|$|E
