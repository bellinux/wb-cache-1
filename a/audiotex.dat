50|$|The Multi-Vendor Integration Protocol (MVIP) is a {{hardware}} bus for {{computer telephony integration}} (<b>Audiotex)</b> equipment, a PCM data highway for interconnecting expansion boards inside a PC. It was invented and brought to market by Natural Microsystems Inc (now NMS Communications).|$|E

50|$|Computer manufacturers, {{telephone}} equipment manufacturers and software firms began developing more sophisticated solutions as {{more powerful and}} less expensive computer processors and storage devices became available. This {{set the stage for}} a creation of a broad spectrum of computer based Central Office and Customer Premises Equipment that would eventually support enhanced voice solutions such as voicemail, <b>audiotex,</b> interactive voice response (IVR) and speech recognition solutions that began emerging in the 1980s. However, broad adoption of these products and services would depend on the global proliferation of touch tone phones and mobile phone services which would not occur until the late 1980s.|$|E

40|$|Much can {{be learned}} from the <b>audiotex</b> {{experience}} regarding the future regulation of automated, recorded, live conversation and fax-based information and entertainment telecommunication services. <b>Audiotex</b> has raised a number of 'carriage v content' issues with significance for value-added multimedia services more generally. In addition, <b>audiotex</b> has led policy makers and practitioners alike to wrestle with the challenges posed to traditional, industry-focused regulatory regimes by the convergence of the telecommunications, broadcasting, computing and publishing industries which {{lies at the heart of}} the development of multimedia services. This paper draws heavily on events in two of the most developed domestic <b>audiotex</b> markets (the UK and the USA) in discussing four lessons which it is suggested both industry players and regulatory bodies take from the <b>audiotex</b> experience in considering the future development and oversight of electronic information and telecommunication services. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a technique for non-keyword rejection {{and we will}} evaluate {{in the context of}} an <b>audiotex</b> service using the ten Spanish digits. The baseline keyword recognition system is a speaker-independent continuous density Hidden Markov Model recognizer. We propose the use of an affine transformation to the log-probability of the garbage model, an HMM model trained to account for both non-keyword speech and non-stationary telephone noises. The parameters of the transformation for the case of isolate...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the policy}} conflicts arising {{in the first}} decade of 976 or <b>audiotex</b> services in the USA and examines their implications for the emergent intelligent network that is being assembled piece by piece, with respect to both hardware and institutional structure. The 976 services, whereby information services are delivered over the telecommunications network, are an important component of this structure. The policy conflicts associated with 976 services have centred on dial-a-porn services but the resultant policies have a bearing on all information services delivered over the network. The article documents the policy debates and their outcomes and identifies serious concerns regarding censorial powers assigned to common carriers, competition, privacy and cost allocation. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion on}} how traffic information is obtained and how the congestion of a major freeway affects travel behavior. It reports on survey results of commuters affected by two highway incidents south of San Francisco. The survey collected information on travel behavior, how the traffic information was obtained, and how it influenced route, model of travel and departure time. Results of the surveys suggest that travel behavior is largely unaffected by individual incidents of congestion. The study {{is also one of}} several designed to provide an assessment {{of the impact of the}} TravInfo traveler advisory telephone system (TATS) in the San Francisco Bay Area.

40|$|This study assesses a scale {{measuring}} {{appropriateness of}} media {{for a variety}} oforgani-zational communication activities and then compmes seven media a m s s six organiza-tional sites. The ranking of media were face-to-fae, telephone, meetings, desktop video and videoconfmcing, voice mail, text, and electronic mail. Although information exchange and socioemotional relations dimensions emerged, the first provided a pmsi-monwus solution. Multidimensional scaling placed tmditwnal media in separate clus-ters, and new media together with some instances of text and phone, along interpersonal-mediated and synchronous-asynchronous axes. The appropriateness of faceto-face and meetings did not change over time, whereas ratings of phone and text (to some extent) and new media did. Appropriateness of new media was weakly associated with use. Finally, {{there was very little}} evidence of social infonnafwn processing influence on appropriateness, except for organizational newwmm ’ mtings of the newest medium, desktop video. A growing number of organizations are adopting, using, and evaluating new media (electronic mail, facsimile, voice mail, intraorganizational video, group decision support systems, groupware, <b>audiotex,</b> etc.). Concurrently, theories about choice, use...|$|E
40|$|TravInfo was {{a federally}} funded Field Operational Test (FOT) of the Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) in the San Francisco Bay Area. The general public can obtain most current {{traveler}} information through TravInfo's Traveler Advisory Telephone System (TATS) and privately offered information services including traffic Web sites. As part of the TravInfo FOT Evaluation, two waves of TATS callers were surveyed. The first wave of the TATS caller survey was conducted in April 1997. The second wave TATS caller survey was completed in April 1999. This paper presents {{the findings of the}} second survey of TravInfo 817 - 1717 callers. The second survey used basically the same survey instrument to compare the results with the initial survey of April 1997. The key findings of the second survey were that although TATS has not substantially increased its customer base, it has been effective in providing quality information and in maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. Offering easy access to traveler information via a single telephone number was one of the highly desirable features of TravInfo TATS.
