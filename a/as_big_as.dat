Unlike the traditional Windows service packs, the standalone installer, {{which could be}} downloaded once and installed {{as many times as}} needed, requires a Windows 8.1-specific product key. On July 1, 2014, acknowledging difficulties users may have had through the Windows Store update method, Microsoft began to phase in an automatic download process for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the initial}} success of the German summer {{offensive}} in 1942, Hitler and the German commanders became more ambitious, putting great strain on the German army. Hitler did not expect the Soviets {{to be able to}} launch a counter-offensive <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> Operation Uranus and sent troops elsewhere, ordering the Wehrmacht to simultaneously achieve several goals. Opposition led to Hitler sacking dissenters and interfering more in command.|$|E
25|$|G. aurea is a {{perennial}} herb that forms small, compact rosettes composed of nearly linear leaves about 2mm wide.
