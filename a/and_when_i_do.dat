500|$|... "There are {{no words}} to {{describe}} the weariness I feel today. I have not slept well in days, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> there is no comfort. My dreams are violent and full of betrayal. Like my life, there's no escape. I feel the responsibility of this film. I cannot talk about Evita and her life without defending myself... Dear God, what have I gotten myself into? What is happening to me? Today we went to shoot a music video for my next song. But I kept forgetting the lyrics, and felt like crying each and every time I did it. It was so frustrating. It's my own song!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackmun filed {{separate}} {{opinions in}} 1989's Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, warning that Roe was in jeopardy: [...] "I am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> step down, {{the confirmation process}} for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the simple}} reason"--Gombauld mimicked her voice--"that {{you want me}} to make love to you <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> to have the {{amusement}} of running away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{jumped up}} quickly, you may believe, for I didn't often see that look on Quin's face, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> knew well that {{something}} very serious {{was in the}} wind.|$|R
60|$|Cautiously I edged {{about the}} far side of the trees until I could obtain a view of the spot from which the spear must have come, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> saw the head of a man just {{emerging}} from behind a bush.|$|R
60|$|Wot {{with the}} {{excitement}} and the running I couldn't speak at fust, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> he said <b>I</b> was trying to deceive 'im.|$|R
60|$|Leon. 'Tis {{hard to have}} my {{inclination}} forced. I {{would not}} marry, sir; <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I hope you'll give me freedom in my choice.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, well,' said I, 'I did {{not notice}} her dress, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not notice people's clothes I nearly always think they dress in black. Is she nice?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, Betts, don't cry. I shall {{come home}} again. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> I hope I shall be {{in time to}} {{celebrate}} another event, this time with you as the heroine. Good-bye. Goodbye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For heaven's sake, Barbara," [...] he said, with ostentatious indignation, [...] "go {{and dress}} {{yourself}} properly. Had you neither money nor credit to purchase clothes? I declare I didn't know you at first; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> was shocked; before Mrs. Markham, too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl looked}} away from him. [...] "I was {{not good enough to}} {{understand}} its value at first, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> tried to make you take it back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,--yes. I {{have said}} as much as that, but I have never got an answer. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ask her, she merely left me. She is not much given to talking.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it, Mother; then I'll help myself, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> God {{help you}} all," [...] {{and with a}} contemptuous shrug of her broad {{shoulders}} she walked away, leaving the poor old Prioress almost in tears.|$|E
60|$|There was a death-where-is-thy-sting-fullness {{about her}} manner which I found distasteful. It isn't often that I score off Jeeves in the devastating fashion just described, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> I {{like to see}} happy, smiling faces about me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} quite settled myself; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> I mean to work entirely {{in my own}} way, and shall say nothing about it until I {{come to you and}} say I have succeeded, or I have failed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I shall; I didn't sleep much last night, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> dreamed like fun. See here, {{you tell}} the people that I know, and it's all right, and I don't want them {{to talk about it}} or howl over me. That's all; now drone away, and I'll try to sleep. Wish I could for a year, and wake up cured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say that. It's {{a matter}} of,--faith, thin, it's {{a matter of}} nigh twenty years since I saw the Captain. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see him <b>I</b> didn't like him. I can tell you that, Mr. Neville." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt {{a little}} comforted when the good fellow spoke thus, but I could not forgive myself. For some time after that I quite gave up my {{chemical}} and other experiments, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ultimately resume them, I went to work with extreme caution.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I did {{not come}} and see you here, I suppose that I should never see you," [...] said he, seating himself. [...] "I do not often go to parties, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> you {{are not likely to}} be there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grant {{that with}} zeal and skill, this day, I do [...] What {{me to do}} behooves, what thou command'st me to; [...] Grant that I do it sharp, at point of moment fit, [...] <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it, grant me good success in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a little}} girl--you saw her {{when you were in}} London. She is married now, but I think of her sometimes; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> you and old Jennings seem to me like a couple of blithering idiots cursing things too {{wonderful}} for you to understand!" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{crowd had}} {{collected}} {{to see whether}} I should recognise myself, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, the merriment was extreme. They begged me to send them a supply of vermilion, goldleaf, and brushes; our so called camel's-hair pencils being much superior to theirs, which are made of marmot's hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I saw {{you shoot}} Pedro Johnson,' says I, 'and I took that little popgun {{away from you}} that you <b>did</b> it with. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so <b>I</b> noticed three or four little scars in a row over your right eyebrow. You've been in rookus before, haven't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I had not, at first, {{the courage}} to ring at the gate; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ring, my errand {{seemed to me to}} be {{expressed}} in the very sound of the bell. The little parlour-maid came out, with the key in her hand; and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I feel a {{thousand}} years old. I don't see people, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> I don't know 'em. My head's in a cloud." [...] He let it hang heavily; then he lifted it, and said: [...] "He's a nice, comfortable fellow, Munt is. Why didn't he stop and talk a bit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I refuse," [...] Engleton answered. [...] "I refuse {{once and}} for always. I tell you that I have {{made up my mind}} to see you punished for this. How I get out I don't care, but I shall get out, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> you two will be laid by the heels." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{not stand}} in your way. I'll {{get a little}} flat and I shan't come too much to London, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{you can get out}} of town. You must be {{discreet}} about Easton, and if people say anything about him, send them to me. After all, this is our private affair.|$|E
60|$|I went to Court, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{returned}} <b>did</b> {{some work}} upon the Tales.|$|R
60|$|Thus was I bluntly {{dismissed}} from the poop, {{only to find}} Mugridge sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him. I made no haste to return on deck, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> was gratified to see Miss Brewster in animated conversation with Wolf Larsen. As I say, the sight gratified me. She was following my advice. And yet I was conscious of a slight shock or hurt in {{that she was able}} to <b>do</b> the thing <b>I</b> had begged her to do and which she had notably disliked.|$|R
60|$|He {{listened to}} my {{narrative}} keenly, but with many interruptions. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>done,</b> he sighed.|$|R
6000|$|Lulu {{glared at}} him and said, in a voice of honey and aloes, [...] "I'm sure, papa dear, I don't ask very much of you, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> ask just this one little thing that I'm sure anybody else {{would be glad to}} help me with and me doing my very best to make you happy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gracious me! Mr. Slope," [...] said she, [...] "I {{hope you}} don't {{mean to say}} you keep all the trash I write to you. Half my time I don't know what I write, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> I know it is only fit for {{the back of the}} fire. I hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With Harry Riddle." [...] He spoke quietly, {{that was}} the terrifying part of it. [...] "David, I've looked for that man in Italy and France, I've scoured London for him, and, by God, I'll find him before he dies. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> find him I swear to you {{that there will be}} no such thing as time wasted, or mercy." ...|$|E
60|$|The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{retire to}} rest till late, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> could not sleep. He {{returned}} after midnight, and, {{instead of going}} to bed, shut himself into the room beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.|$|R
60|$|He {{heard me}} out with serious interest, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>done,</b> seemed to {{consider}} a little with himself.|$|R
60|$|Poly. You shall {{this hour}} have the {{assurance}} of it.-- Leonidas, come hither; you have heard, I doubt not, {{that the father}} of this princess Was my most faithful friend, while I was yet A private man; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> assume This crown, he served me in the high attempt. You see, then, to what gratitude obliges me; Make your addresses to her.|$|R
