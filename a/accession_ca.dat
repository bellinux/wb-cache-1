40|$|Capsaicin and {{ascorbic acid}} {{contents}} of seven Indian peppers varieties/accessions from Capsicum annuum (CA 97, CCH, K 1, KTPL 19, Arka Abhir and Bayadagi Kaddi) and C. frutescens (CF 1) species were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Based on their pungency value, all the chilli accession/varieties (CA 97, CCH, K 1, and CF 1) {{were classified as}} highly pungent peppers. The accession CF 1 showed the highest concentration of capsaicin (445 mg 100 g - 1 DW) with corresponding pungency value of 71, 200 SHUs and Arka Abhir variety showed the lowest capsaicin concentration (29 mg 100 g - 1 DW) with 4, 672 SHUs of pungency value. Similarly, Bayadaggi kaddi variety showed the highest ascorbic acid content (189 mg/ 100 FW) and the <b>accession</b> <b>CA</b> 97 showed the lowest ascorbic acid contents (55. 3 mg/ 100 FW). The variability in capsaicin and ascorbic acid content presented in the pepper germplasm can be exploited for breeding cultivars with improved nutritional qualities. Moreover, CF 1 and Bayadagi kaddi {{can be used as}} a potential source for capsaicin and vitamin C, respectively...|$|E
40|$|During storage, {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum L.) {{is severely}} attacked by some bruchid species, especially Callosobruchus chinensis L. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), resulting in losses in quantity and nutritional quality. In the present study, three species of Cicer including five accessions of Cicer arietinum L. (three kabuli and two desi chickpeas), four accessions of C. echinospermum P. H. Davis and five accessions of C. reticulatum Ladiz. were screened for resistance to C. chinensis in both free-choice and no-choice {{tests in the}} laboratory. Resistance was evaluated by measuring oviposition (number of eggs per seed), adult emergence (number of holes per seed), damaged seed rate and seed weight loss (%). The results revealed that no eggs were laid by the bruchid females to the C. echinospermum accessions in free-choice test, but in no-choice test only two C. echinospermum accessions (AWC 304 and AWC 305) had few eggs (4. 3 and 3. 3 eggs/seed, respectively). The highest rate of oviposition occurred in kabuli chickpeas, especially in YAR (25. 1 eggs/seed in free-choice test). The accessions exhibited a similar pattern for adult emergence like in the oviposition rates. As for damaged seed rate, no damage was observed in both tests in the C. echinospermum accessions, except AWC 304 (6. 7 %) in no-choice test. The highest seed damage was seen in kabuli-type accessions, being 100 % in YAR and ILC 8617. Considering seed weight loss, no weight loss occurred in the C. echinospermum accessions in both tests (except, AWC 304 in no-choice test) whereas the highest weight loss {{was seen in the}} kabuli-type <b>accession,</b> <b>CA</b> 2969 (28. 6 %) in free-choice test and in the desi type accession, ICC 4957 (35. 0 %) in no-choice test. Since lower numbers of eggs were laid on hairy, wrinkled/reticulated and dark seed accessions, these features seemed to be important in the preference of the bruchid for host selection and oviposition. These results suggest that resistant varieties can be used as gene sources in breeding new cultivars resistant to C. chinensis...|$|E
40|$|Pepper {{powdery mildew}} causes {{increasingly}} economical damage {{due to increased}} cultivation of pepper ingreenhouses. To assess resistance of pepper resources against pepper powdery mildew, we developed a novelevaluation formula for pepper resistance against powdery mildew. The evaluation formula named S index isas follows; (number of the highest disease leaf/top leaf number) -(number of the lowest disease leaf/top leafnumber). Positive correlation (81 %, P = 0. 01) between S index and authentic disease leaf rate was observedfrom the pepper plants infected by powdery mildew. Various pepper species from our genetic resources wereevaluated to identify pepper varieties conferring resistance against powdery mild using S-index. Capsicumfrutescens <b>accessions</b> 3 <b>CA</b> 131 and C. baccatum <b>accessions</b> 3 <b>CA</b> 0162, 3 CA 174, 3 CA 176 showed high resistanceto powdery mildew, but none of C. annuum was resistant. Results suggest that S-index proposed in this studyis useful to assess resistance evaluation of powdery mildew in chili pepper breeding...|$|R
40|$|Cytoplasmic male {{sterility}} of chilli cultivars was evaluated for their prospective genotypes. Fifteen pairs of F 1 hybrids were evaluated for their male pollen viabilities in three natures. Hybrids which showed no pollen occurred in 9 varieties whose male parents {{should have the}} prospective genotypes of N rfrf or B line. Hybrids with fertile pollens in some plants and sterile ones on others appeared in 4 varieties whose male parents should have prospective genotypes of N/S Rfrf. Hybrids showing fertile pollens were found in 2 varieties whose male parents should have the {{male sterility}} controlling genes in the nucleus as N/S RfRf or C line. Horticultural characteristics of six accessions of chilies were recorded. Chilli fruits of the accessions were analyzed for the physico-chemical properties in terms of moisture content, total soluble solids, vitamin C, capsaicin content and skin color. <b>Accessions</b> <b>CA</b> 1445, CA 1449 and CA 1450 {{were found to have}} suitable characteristics as maintainer lines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Progenies of ‘Schmidt's Antonovka’ (SA) {{have been}} widely used in Western {{breeding}} programs as a source of scab resistance. The identity of SA has remained obscure, especially due to the existence of a series of ‘Antonovka’ cultivars with different origins. In this paper we show Schmidt's Antonovka to be identical to ¿¿¿¿´¿¿¿¿¿ ¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿ or ‘Common Antonovka’ (CA), an old Russian cultivar of unknown origin, by comparing simple sequence repeat (SSR) and SNP genotyping data from several first-generation descendants of SA from two European collections and a <b>CA</b> <b>accession</b> from the germplasm collection held at VNIISPK (The All-Russian Research Institute of Horticultural Breeding, Orel, Russia). The use of CA in Russian breeding programs is also briefly reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that {{undergoes a}} temperaturedependent cell morphology change from mycelium (22 ◦C) to yeast (36 ◦C). It {{is assumed that}} this morphological transition correlates with the infection of the human host. Our goal was to identify genes expressed in the mycelium (M) and yeast (Y) forms by EST sequencing in order to generate a partial map of the fungus transcriptome. Individual EST sequences were clustered by the CAP 3 program and annotated using Blastx similarity analysis and InterPro Scan. Three different databases, GenBank nr, COG (clusters of orthologous groups) and GO (gene ontology) were used for annotation. A total of 3938 (Y = 1654 and M = 2274) ESTs were sequenced and clustered into 597 contigs and 1563 singlets, making up a total of 2160 genes, which possibly represent one-quarter of the complete gene repertoire in P. brasiliensis. From this total, 1040 were successfully annotated and 894 could be classified in 18 functional COG categories as follows: cellular metabolism (44 %); information storage and processing (25 %); cellular processes — cell division, posttranslational modifications, among others (19 %); and genes of unknown functions (12 %). Computer analysis enabled us to identify some genes potentially involved in the dimorphic transition and drug resistance. Furthermore, computer subtraction analysis revealed several genes possibly expressed in stage-specific forms of P. brasiliensis. Further analysis of these genes may provide {{new insights into the}} pathology and differentiation of P. brasiliensis. All EST sequences have been deposited in GenBank under <b>Accession</b> Nos <b>CA</b> 580326 –CA 584263...|$|R
40|$|The {{circumscription}} and the phylogeny of the fern family Tectariaceae {{have been}} controversial. Previous molecular studies {{have supported the}} monophyly of this family, with 4 - 5 genera. However, these studies were exclusively based on plastid markers and relatively small sampling, especially of the non-Tectaria genera. In the present study, DNA sequences of eight plastid and one nuclear markers of 25 accessions representing 19 species of Tectaria and 58 <b>accessions</b> representing <b>ca.</b> 90 % of the non-Tectaria species in the family (including Arthropteris) were used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony. Our major results include: (1) Tectaria as currently circumscribed is not monophyletic and {{can be divided into}} three genera: Tectaria s. str., Draconopteris (gen. nov.) from Central to South America, and Malaifilix (gen. nov.) from Malesia; (2) Draconopteris and Malaifilix, the two new genera, together with Pteridrys, form a strongly supported Glade; (3) in our ML analyses, the Glade containing Draconopteris, Malaifilix, and Pteridrys (the DMP Glade) is resolved as sister to the rest of Tectariaceae and Arthropteris is sister to Tectaria+(Hypoderris + Triplophyllum), suggesting that Arthropteris should be treated as a member of Tectariaceae, and thus Tectariaceae contains seven genera: Arthropteris, Draconopteris, Hypoderris, Malaifilix, Pteridrys, Tectaria, and Triplophyllum; (4) with the well-supported relationships among the members of Tectariaceae, anastomosing venation in the family is inferred to have evolved independently at least three times; (5) Nephrolepis is strongly supported as sister to a Glade containing Cyclopeltis, Dracoglossum, and Lomariopsis, and thus we advocate that Lomariopsidaceae include these four genera (plus the unsampled Thysanosoria); and (6) intercontinental dispersal appears to have {{played an important role in}} shaping the extant distribution of Tectariaceae...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{genetic variation}} for contents of cationic minerals in seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana was studied by screening {{a series of}} <b>accessions</b> (ecotypes) for <b>Ca,</b> Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Zn, and for total contents of P. Variation was observed for all minerals and correlations between contents of various minerals were present, most noticeably between Ca and Mg, P and Mg, and P and Mn. The genetic basis of this variation was further studied by QTL analysis, using the Landsberg erecta (Ler) x Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) recombinant inbred population. For all minerals, except Na, one or more QTL were detected, explaining up to 78 % of the variation. The map positions of several QTL were confirmed by analysis of near isogenic lines, carrying small Cvi introgressions in Ler background. Interesting co-locations of QTL suggest pleiotropic effects, due to physiological coupling of the accumulation of certain minerals or to linkage of different genes. By comparing the map positions of QTL with the positions of genes expected {{to play a role}} in cation translocation, several candidate genes are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Background: Polystichum (Dryopteridaceae) is {{probably}} the third largest fern genus {{in the world and}} contains ca. 500 species. Species of Polystichum occur on all continents except Antarctica, but its highest diversity is found in East Asia, especially Southwest China and adjacent regions. Previous studies typically had sparse taxon sampling and used limited DNA sequence data. Consequently, the majority of morphological hypotheses/classifications have never been tested using molecular data. Results: In this study, DNA sequences of five plastid loci of 177 <b>accessions</b> representing <b>ca.</b> 140 species of Polystichum and 13 species of the closely related genera were used to infer a phylogeny using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and maximum parsimony. Our analyses show that (1) Polystichum is monophyletic, this being supported by not only molecular data but also morphological features and distribution information; (2) Polystichum is resolved into two strongly supported monophyletic clades, corresponding to the two subgenera, P. subg. Polystichum and P. subg. Haplopolystichum; (3) Accessions of P. subg. Polystichum are resolved into three major clades: clade K (P. sect. Xiphophyllum), clade L (P. sect. Polystichum), and the HYMASO superclade dominated by accessions of P. sect. Hypopeltis, P. sect. Macropolystichum, and P. sect. Sorolepidium, while those of P. subg. Haplopolystichum are resolved into eight major clades; and (4) The monophyly of the Afra clade (weakly supported), the Australasian clade (weakly supported), and the North American clade (strongly supported) is confirmed. Conclusions: Of the 23 sections of Polystichum recognized in a recent classification of the genus, four (P. sect. Hypopeltis, P. sect. Neopolystichum, P. sect. Sorolepidium, P. sect. Sphaenopolystichum) are resolved as non-monophyletic, 16 are recovered as monophyletic, and three are monospecific. Of the 16 monophyletic sections, two (P. sect. Adenolepia, P. sect. Cyrtogonellum) are weakly supported and 14 are strongly supported as monophyletic. The relationships of 11 sections (five in P. subg. Haplopolystichum; six in P. subg. Polystichum) are well resolved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicrotubules are dynamic {{assemblies}} of αβ-tubulin heterodimers {{and have}} been recognized as highly attractive targets for cancer chemotherapy. A broad range of agents bind to tubulin and interfere with microtubule assembly. Despite having {{a long history of}} characterization, colchicine binding site inhibitors (CBSIs) have not yet reached the commercial phase as anti-cancer drugs to date. We determined the structures of tubulin complexed with a set of structurally diverse CBSIs (lexibulin, nocodazole, plinabulin and tivantinib), among which nocodazole and tivantinib are both binary-function inhibitors targeting cancer-related kinases and microtubules simultaneously. High resolution structures revealed the detailed interactions between these ligands and tubulin. Our results showed that the binding modes of the CBSIs were different from previous docking models, highlighting the importance of crystal structure information in structure-based drug design. A real structure-based pharmacophore was proposed to rationalize key common interactions of the CBSIs at the colchicine domain. Our studies provide a solid structural basis for developing new anti-cancer agents for the colchicine binding site. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for tubulin complexed with lexibulin, nocodazole, plinabulin and tivantinib have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under <b>accession</b> codes 5 <b>CA</b> 0, 5 CA 1, 5 C 8 Y and 5 CB 4, respectively...|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{identifying}} rice (Oryza spp.) germplasm having enhanced grain nutritional value, the mineral nutrient and trace element concentrations (or ionome) of whole (unmilled) grains from a set of 1763 rice accessions of diverse geographic and genetic origin were evaluated. Seed for analysis of P, Mg, K, S, Ca, As, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Rb, Sr, and Zn concentrations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was produced over 2 yr in Beaumont, TX, under both flooded and unflooded watering regimes. The distributions of all element concentrations analyzed were skewed toward higher concentration. A significant portion of this ionomic variation has a genetic basis (broad sense heritabilities 0. 14 – 0. 75), indicating an ability to breed for improved grain concentration of all elements except possibly Ni. Variation in grain elemental concentrations was not strongly associated with plant height, heading time, or grain shape, suggesting these physiological factors are not of primary importance in controlling ionomic variation in rice grain. Accessions high in specific elements were sometimes found to have similar genetic or geographic origins, suggesting they share a heritable mechanism underlying their enhanced ionomes. For example, <b>accessions</b> with high <b>Ca,</b> Mg, or K were {{more common in the}} indica than in the japonica subgroup; low As was most common among temperate japonica accessions; and several lines high in Mo originated in Malaysia or adjacent Brunei...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} {{of more than}} 3000 accessions of triticale (x Triticosecale Wittmack), called the North American Triticale Genetic Resources Collection (NATGRC), was assembled from 10 active and inactive breeding programs in the USA, Canada, and Mexico for the purposes of conservation, characterization, evaluation, and documentation. Since triticale has no wild ancestors and hybrid parentage is often unknown, preservation of unique gene combinations is essential for continued utilization. The origin groups that comprised the whole collection were evaluated in field plots for 2 yr at Davis, <b>CA.</b> <b>Accessions</b> were predominantly secondary hexaploid triticales having spring growth habit. The collection was classified for spike type and 38 % has spikes typical of complete (Beagle type) and 30 % were substituted (Armadillo type) triticale. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'), computed for seven qualitative traits, was 1. 275 for the whole collection. The most diverse group was from Manitoba (1. 404) and the least diverse groups were from Oregon (0. 822) and CIMMYT (0. 867). Over-trait mean coefficients of variation for eight quantitative traits gave similar diversity ratings as H' for each of the origin groups (r = 0. 74 *), suggesting that simply scored traits may be useful for assessing overall diversity in large genetic resource collections. Principal components (PC) analysis of quantitative traits showed differentation, but considerable commonality, among the Canada, Mexico, and USA groups. The CA-Davis group included hybrid derivatives from CA-Jenkins x CIMMYT groups that clustered intermediate to those groups, suggesting a genetic basis for the phenotypic clustering. The PC analysis showed that the Beagle and Armadillo types differed in several quantitative traits, showing that this classification is a useful descriptor for hexaploid triticale. The NATGRC is conserved at USDA, Aberdeen, ID, and CIMMYT, Mexico. Researchers are urged to use and contribute to this collection. The formation of a European-based collection emphasizing winter growth habit is recommended. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
