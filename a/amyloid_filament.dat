40|$|While a {{significant}} body of investigations have {{been focused on}} the process of protein self-assembly, much less is understood about the reverse process of a filament breaking due to thermal motion into smaller fragments, or depolymerization of subunits from the filament ends. Indirect evidence for actin and <b>amyloid</b> <b>filament</b> fragmentation has been reported, although the phenomenon has never been directly observed either experimentally or in simulations. Here we report the direct observation of filament depolymerization and breakup in a minimal, calibrated model of coarse-grained molecular simulation. We quantify the orders of magnitude by which the depolymerization rate from the filament ends k_off is larger than fragmentation rate k_- and establish the law k_off/k_- = [(ε_ - ε_) / k_BT] = [0. 5 ε / k_BT], which accounts for the topology and energy of bonds holding the filament together. This mechanism and the order-of-magnitude predictions are well supported by direct experimental measurements of depolymerization of insulin amyloid filaments...|$|E
40|$|The [URE 3] {{infectious}} protein (prion) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a self-propagating amyloid form of Ure 2 p. The C-terminal {{domain of}} Ure 2 p controls nitrogen catabolism by complexing with the transcription factor, Gln 3 p, whereas the asparagine-rich N-terminal “prion” domain {{is responsible for}} <b>amyloid</b> <b>filament</b> formation (prion conversion). On filament formation, Ure 2 p is inactivated, reflecting either a structural change in the C-terminal domain or steric blocking of its interaction with Gln 3 p. We fused the prion domain with four proteins whose activities should not be sterically impeded by aggregation because their substrates are very small: barnase, carbonic anhydrase, glutathione S-transferase, and green fluorescent protein. All formed amyloid filaments in vitro, whose diameters increased with {{the mass of the}} appended enzyme. The helical repeat lengths were consistent within a single filament but varied with the construct and between filaments from a single construct. CD data suggest that, in the soluble fusion proteins, the prion domain has no regular secondary structure, whereas earlier data showed that in filaments, it is virtually all β-sheet. In filaments, the activity of the appended proteins was at most mildly reduced, when substrate diffusion effects were taken into account, indicating that they retained their native structures. These observations suggest that the amyloid content of these filaments is confined to their prion domain-containing backbones and imply that Ure 2 p is inactivated in [URE 3] cells by a steric blocking mechanism...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe amyloid {{deposits}} of Alzheimer's disease contain, {{in addition to}} the β protein (Aβ), lesser amounts of other proteins including the protease inhibitor α 1 -antichymotrypsin (ACT). We have recently shown that ACT acts as a pathological chaperone, binding to the β protein and strongly promoting its polymerization into <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments</b> in vitro. The data of this paper show that ACT synthesis is induced in cultured human astrocytes by IL- 1, a lymphokine whose expression is strongly up-regulated in microglial cells in affected areas of Alzheimer's disease brain. Furthermore, unfractionated glial cultures containing both astrocytes and microglia from human cortex (which develops amyloid in Alzheimer's disease) spontaneously express IL- 1 and ACT as they reach confluence. In contrast, confluent mixed glial cultures similarly prepared from human cerebellum or brain stem, or from rat brain—tissues not prone to amyloid formation—do not express ACT unless supplemented with exogenous IL- 1. The same regional difference in IL- 1 expression by microglia is seen in vivo in Alzheimer's disease. These results indicate that the IL- 1 -induced expression of ACT may help direct the region-specific production of mature <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments</b> in the Alzheimer brain...|$|R

40|$|Two {{cases of}} lichen amyloidosus and 8 cases of macular {{amyloidosis}} were examined by electron microscopy. Epidermal keratinocytes showed variable degrees of focal degeneration in the basal or lower Malpighian layer. The primary change {{was seen in}} cells which contain fibrillar (30 nm in thickness) cytoplasmic inclusion. The following developments seemed to lead to filamentous degeneration (colloid bodies) : (1) aggregation of tonofilaments within the granular or fibrillar cytoplasm, (2) filamentous cells, which are composed of bundles of 7 -nm thick filaments surrounded by cell membrane and desmosomes, and (3) filamentous masses composed of bundles or whorls of tightly packed 7 -nm thick filaments in the intercellular spaces. At the dermo-epidermal junction, some of the filamentous masses were surrounded by the basal lamina of the epidermis and others were dropping into the dermis. Occasionally, loosened <b>filaments</b> (similar to <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments)</b> were about to drop into the dermis. Early formation of amyloid islands consisted of electron-dense and electron-light parts. They were located directly beneath the epidermis. In the deeper portion of the papillary dermis and in the upper reticular dermis, the majority were electron-light masses. Electron dense parts were the densely packed 7 -nm thick filaments, whereas electron-light parts were the typical straight <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments.</b> Small tubular filaments were seen in common in the filamentous cells, filamentous masses, and amyloid islands.

We found that gene expression for PrP and the beta-protein precursor (beta-PP) is regulated in developing hamster brain.

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} shown that human {{ejaculate}} enhances human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) infectivity. Enhancement of infectivity is conceived to be mediated by <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments</b> from peptides that are proteolytically released from prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), termed Semen-derived Enhancer of Virus Infection (SEVI). The aim of this study was to test the range of HIV- 1 infectivity enhancing properties of a large number of individual semen samples (n = 47) in a TZM-bl reporter cell HIV infection system. We find that semen overall increased infectivity to 156 % of the control experiment without semen, albeit with great inter- and intraindividual variability (range - 53 %- 363 %). Using transmission electron microscopy, we provide evidence for SEVI fibrils in fresh human semen for the first time. Moreover, we confirm that the infectivity enhancing property can be inhibited by the major green tea ingredient epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) at non-toxic concentrations. The median inhibition of infection by treatment with 0. 4 mM EGCG was 70. 6 % (p < 0. 0001) in our cohort. Yet, there were substantial variations of inhibition and in a minority of samples, infectivity enhancement was not inhibited by EGCG treatment at all. Thus, topical application of EGCG may be a feasible additional measure to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. However, the reasons for the variability in the efficacy of the abrogation of semen-mediated enhancement of HIV- 1 infectivity and EGCG efficacy have to be elucidated before therapeutic trials can be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Amyloid beta {{peptides}} are {{the major}} components of the vascular and plaque <b>amyloid</b> <b>filaments</b> in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although it is still unclear what initiates the disease, isomerization of aspartic acid residues in A beta peptides {{is directly related to}} the pathology of AD. The detection of isomerization products is analytically challenging, due to their similar chemical properties and identical molecular mass. Different methods have been applied to differentiate and quantify the isomers, including immunology, chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Typically, those methods require comparative analysis with the standard peptides and involve many sample preparation steps. To understand the role of A beta isomerization in AD progression, a fast, simple, accurate, and reproducible method is necessary. In this work, electron capture dissociation (ECD) Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR MS) was applied to detect isomerization in A beta peptides. ECD generated diagnostic fragment ions for the two isomers of A beta 17 - 28, [M + 2 H - 60](+center dot) and z(6) (center dot) - 44 when aspartic acid was present and z(6) (center dot) - 57 when isoaspartic acid was present. Additionally, the z. - 57 diagnostic ion was also observed in the electron ionization dissociation (EID) spectra of the modified A beta 17 - 28 fragment. ECD was further applied toward A beta 1 - 40 and A beta 1 - 42. The diagnostic ion c(6) + 57 was observed in the ECD spectra of the A beta 1 - 42 peptide, demonstrating isomerization at residue 7. In conclusion, both ECD and EID can clearly determine the presence and the position of isoaspartic acid residues in amyloid beta peptides. The next step, therefore, is to apply this method to analyze samples of Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals in order to generate a better understanding of the disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} a variety of {{different}} proteins and peptides to bind to carbon nanotubes leading to stable nanotube aqueous dispersions offers wide opportunities for nanotube processing in biological systems and in the development of carbon nanotube-based bio-devices. It has been thus demonstrated that peptide coating facilitates carbon nanotube uptake by cells. [1] On the other hand, these nanotube dispersions have efficiently been employed in the coagulation spinning of macroscopic carbon nanotube biocomposite fibers. [2] Moreover, peptide-coated carbon nanotubes can self-assemble into supramolecular architectures and hierarchical structures such as microfibers,[3] fractal-like structures,[4] and liquid crystal ordered domains. [5]. We here report on the interactions between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and a short hexapeptide homologous to a portion of the tau, a protein known to form <b>amyloid</b> helical <b>filaments</b> in the brains of Alzheimer’s diseased patients. We here show that the employed hexapeptide is capable of efficiently dispersing SWNTs. The ability of various single site mutants to disperse SWNTs in water and the resulting strong peptide/SWNT interaction was characterized using electron microscopy, NIR and CD spectroscopies, an...|$|R

40|$|Ultrastructural {{organization}} of hemodialysis-associated β 2 -microglobulin amyloid fibrils. Fibrils of hemodialysis-associated β 2 -microglobulin amyloid were examined by high resolution electron microscopy and immunohistochemical labeling. The amyloid containing tissues obtained through autopsy {{were prepared for}} thin section observations. In contrast {{to other forms of}} amyloid, the most conspicuous feature of these fibrils were their curved conformations. The fibril core showed ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features in common with the core of connective tissue microfibrils and of previously observed fibrils of experimental murine AA amyloidosis and familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP). The core was wrapped in a layer of 3 nm wide ribbon-like “double tracked” structures identified as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) with immunogold labeling {{as well as from the}} results of previous in vitro experiments. Finally, the outer surface of the fibril was associated with a loose assembly of 1 nm wide filaments immunohistochemically identified as β 2 -microglobulin. This is similar to the manner in which AA protein and transthyretin filaments are associated with their respective fibrils. The results of this study provide an additional example for the concept that amyloid fibrils in general are microfibril-like structures externally associated with <b>amyloid</b> protein <b>filaments.</b> An unusual feature of the fibrils of hemodialysis-associated amyloid, however, is the presence of a peripheral layer composed of CSPG rather than of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as in the case of the other two amyloids above. These chondroitin sulfate chains in the outer CSPG layer may be less effective in providing rigidity to the fibril core, thus allowing for the curved conformations of β 2 -microglobulin amyloid fibrils...|$|R
40|$|The self-perpetuating {{conformational}} {{change of the}} translation termination factor Sup 35 {{is associated with a}} prion phenomenon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro, the prion-determining region (NM) of Sup 35 assembles into amyloid-like fibres through a mechanism of nucleated conformational conversion. Here, we describe an alternative assembly pathway of NM that produces filaments that are composed of β-strands and random coiled regions with several-fold smaller diameters than the <b>amyloid</b> fibres. NM <b>filaments</b> are not detectable with either thioflavin T or Congo Red and do not show SDS or protease resistance. As filaments do not self-convert into fibres and do not act as seed, they are not intermediates of amyloid fibre formation. Instead, they represent a stable off-pathway form. Similar to mammalian prion proteins, Sup 35 contains oligopeptide repeats located in the NM region. We found that the number of repeats determines the partitioning of the protein between filaments and amyloid-like fibres. Low numbers of repeats favour the formation of the filamentous structure, whereas high numbers of repeats favour the formation of amyloid-like fibres...|$|R
40|$|Serum amyloid P {{component}} (SAP) is {{a normal}} plasma glycoprotein that is identical to, and the precursor of, amyloid P component (AP) found in deposits {{of all forms of}} amyloid in which it has been sought (1, 2). SAP and C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute-phase reactant, are very similar in molecular configuration, ultrastructural appearance, and amino acid sequence, and together form a distinct family of proteins called pentraxins (1, 3). Proteins homologous with SAP and/or CRP are present in all vertebrates in which they have been sought and neither polymorphism of SAP nor a deficiency state of SAP has been described in man. These features suggest that SAP has an important physiological function, although this is not yet known. SAP exhibits specific calcium-dependent binding to a variety ofligands in vitro, including the pyruvate acetal of galactose, isolated <b>amyloid</b> fibrils, keratin <b>filament</b> aggregates, C 4 binding protein, fibronectin, and some glycosaminoglycans (4 - 8).
