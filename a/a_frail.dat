5|$|In Pezuelas Lebrón {{began her}} {{education}} in a small community school. Early in her life, Lebrón contracted pneumonia when she accidentally fell into a gutter that was full of water, as a consequence she grew with <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> body {{and was unable to}} keep up with the constant activities of her brothers without feeling fatigue. She developed an introverted and contemplative personality, often spending her time admiring nature around the hacienda.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{providing}} a straightforward biography, the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts {{of events in}} Darin's life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from his working class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> Bronx boy plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, and become a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, {{during the}} Haitian Revolution, Dermide {{arrived on the}} island-colony of Saint-Domingue with his parents, {{as part of the}} Saint-Domingue expedition. After his father's death of yellow fever later during the year, Dermide and Pauline were brought back to France. In 1803, Pauline remarried, this time to Italian nobleman Camillo Borghese, and she took up residence, along with her husband and son, in Rome. Always <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> child, Dermide died of a fever at the age of six, three months after his uncle became Emperor and two years before his mother's {{proclamation}} as Duchess of Guastalla.|$|E

25|$|Doheny's {{daughter}} Eileen was <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> {{child and}} {{died at age}} seven on December 14, 1892. Her death was caused by heart disease stemming from rheumatic fever, {{as well as a}} lung infection. Edward and Carrie's marriage was fragile, owing mostly to the harsh reality of mining life and their many financial problems. Eileen's death further strained the marriage. Nearly a year after Eileen's death, on November 6, 1893, Carrie gave birth to their only son Edward Jr., known as Ned.|$|E

25|$|Unintentional {{weight loss}} {{may result from}} loss of body fats, loss of body fluids, muscle atrophy, or even a {{combination}} of these. It is generally regarded as a medical problem when at least 10% of a person's body weight has been lost in six months or 5% in the last month. Another criterion used for assessing weight that is too low is the body mass index (BMI). However, even lesser amounts of weight loss can be a cause for serious concern in <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> elderly person.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2003, Onyango {{lived in}} a South Boston public housing project, {{according}} to Boston Public Housing Authority (BHA) officials.

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Kumashiro was <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> and sickly man. In the 1980s, as the rising AV (Adult Video) {{industry}} took away {{most of the}} audience for the theatrical Roman pornos, Kumashiro's health began failing. He suffered from a collapsed lung in 1983, but, {{in spite of his}} poor health, he continued making films until his death. He directed his last two films, Like a Rolling Stone (Bo no Kanashimi) (1994) and Immoral: Indecent Relations (1995) while using an oxygen tank.

60|$|Being {{a robust}} peasant, the girl came safely through hardships {{that would have}} killed or crazed <b>a</b> <b>frailer</b> creature; and she was soon able to rejoice with the brave fellows over this escape, so audaciously planned and so boldly carried out. They dared stay but a few hours, and before dawn were hastening through the least frequented ways toward home, finding safety in the distracted state of the country, which made fugitives no unusual sight, and {{refugees}} plentiful. One more adventure, and that a happy one, completed their joy, and turned their flight into a triumphant march.|$|R

While Mami appears sweet and well mannered on the outside, in reality she is very cunning and gets jealous when she sees Shigure with Yukina. She is prone to social stress, and as informed by Shigure, she calms down when someone pats her on the head. Mami soon {{falls in love with}} Akira, and even knowing that he likes Yukina, she still confesses to him and they started going out.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of Lear in the 19th century was often that of <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> old {{man from the}} opening scene, but Lears of the 20th century often began the play as strong men displaying regal authority, including John Gielgud, Donald Wolfit and Donald Sinden. Cordelia, also, evolved in the 20th century: earlier Cordelias had often been praised for being sweet, innocent and modest, but 20th-century Cordelias were often portrayed as war leaders. For example, Peggy Ashcroft, at the RST in 1950, played the role in a breastplate and carrying a sword. Similarly, the Fool evolved {{through the course of}} the century, with portrayals often deriving from the music hall or circus tradition.|$|E

25|$|Captain America wears {{a costume}} that bears an American flag motif, and is {{armed with a}} nearly indestructible shield that he throws at foes. The {{character}} is usually depicted as the alter ego of Steve Rogers, <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.|$|E
25|$|John Howe {{probably}} {{began his}} apprenticeship as a printer to Richard Draper in either 1766 or 1767. Richard Draper was the King's printer in Massachusetts and {{the publisher of}} the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, the oldest English newspaper in the Americas. As Richard Draper was known to be <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> and sickly man, and as he was Draper's apprentice, John Howe probably witnessed and wrote the article about the Boston Tea Party that appeared in the December 23, 1773, issue. Less than six months after the report on the Boston Tea Party, Richard Draper, owner of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter, died on June 5 or 6, 1774, leaving the paper in the hands of his widow, Margaret Draper. Richard Draper may have anticipated his demise, as he formed a partnership with John Boyle in May, the month before his death. However, Margaret Draper soon ended this partnership (between August 4 and 11, 1774) as Boyle did not share her loyalist sympathies. Margaret Draper published the paper by herself from August 11, 1774.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{reported}} cases may be myths, or wandering stories. The 1326 Hennegau case, for example, deviates from the others in that the Jew was not a thief, but was suspected (even {{though he was a}} convert to Christianity) of having struck an al fresco painting of Virgin Mary, so that blood had begun to seep down the wall from the painting. Even under all degrees of judicial torture, the Jew denied performing this sacrilegious act, and was therefore exonerated. Then a brawny smith demanded from him a trial by combat, because, supposedly, in a dream the Virgin herself had besought the smith to do so. The court accepted the smith's challenge, he easily won the combat against the Jew, who was duly hanged up by the feet between two dogs. To add to the injury, one let him be slowly roasted as well as hanged. This is a very similar story to one told in France, in which a young Jew threw a lance {{at the head of a}} statue of the Virgin, so that blood spurted out of it. There was inadequate evidence for a normal trial, but <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> old man asked for trial by combat, and bested the young Jew. The Jew confessed his crime, and was hanged by his feet between two mastiffs.|$|E

25|$|The group {{formally}} meets Diana {{who they}} learn has <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> body and has lost her will to live. Diana {{has the power}} to glimpse into the future and see people's fates but Shinjiro eventually convinces her that even if the circumstances look dire, she can fight her destiny and give her a new path to follow. Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens herself up to the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone. Soon, after learning about the Five Star Warriors, Shinjiro recruits Gemini to the Star Division due to her ties to the Five Star Warriors. But in discovering that Ranmaru is one of their enemies, Gemini's sister Geminine—who resides in her body as an alter-ego—plots to exact revenge for her master's death. Shinjiro persuades Geminine not to go through with it. Afterwards, subduing an attack led by Ranmaru, Geminine decides to rest inside Gemini for a while after using too much of her influence to dominate Gemini's body.|$|E
500|$|Josh Scherr, {{leader of}} the Drake's Fortune story {{sequence}} team, said that they created Drake as an [...] "ordinary guy" [...] with no special powers. Instead, Drake became visibly nervous at times, barely cleared objects while jumping, and stumbled while running. The characterizations were meant to show Drake as <b>a</b> <b>frail</b> character. He is not a master of hand-to-hand combat, and throws punches without style or skill. Sam Thompson, producer of Among Thieves, described Drake's martial arts abilities as [...] "fallible." [...] Sony Entertainment of America line producer Sam Thompson mused that Naughty Dog had created iconic characters before, including Crash Bandicoot. With Nathan Drake, however, the company wanted to produce a more average character, one who did not possess {{the same amount of}} confidence and who was more realistic and humble.|$|E
