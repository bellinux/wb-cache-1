5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered <b>axles</b> and no unpowered leading or trailing <b>axles).</b> The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving <b>axles</b> through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two <b>axles</b> to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|VAT used Valmet gearboxes, {{which were}} copied from the {{transmissions}} {{made by the}} American company Fuller in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. When components became more easily available, VAT started to use genuine Fullers and ZF-made gearboxes. The transfer cases were supplied by Timken and ZF. VAT built the rear <b>axles</b> from gears made by ATA until the company started buying <b>axles</b> from Timken.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that on some lines variable gauge <b>axles</b> would achieve significant time savings in comparison to bogie exchange. Their implementation however would involve a much higher capital cost, requiring either retrofitting or replacement of existing bogies.|$|E
50|$|The Saginaw 9.5-inch <b>axle</b> is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} American <b>Axle</b> & Manufacturing, Inc. This differential has three major variants. A rear solid <b>axle,</b> a front solid <b>axle</b> and independent front suspension. General Motor's Saginaw Division started production of this <b>axle</b> {{in the late}} 1970s and all three variations are still in production today. The maximum GAWR for this <b>axle</b> is 6000 pounds.|$|R
5000|$|The Sterling 10.5 <b>axle</b> is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} Ford Motor Company at the Sterling <b>Axle</b> Plant in Sterling Heights, MI. It {{was first used}} in model year 1985 Ford trucks. The <b>axle</b> was developed to replace the Dana 60 and Dana 70. The Sterling 10.5 <b>axle</b> is currently only made as a full floating <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tyres: Type - Pneumatic tyres, front <b>axle</b> duplex tyres, {{middle and}} rear <b>axle</b> single tyres. Size, 270-20. Air {{pressure}} - Front <b>axle,</b> 4,8 atm.; Middle and rear <b>axle,</b> 5,8 atm.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the toll rates for passenger cars, both {{with and without}} FasTrak (as of June 12, 2012). The toll rate is doubled for vehicles with more than two <b>axles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the tolls {{at each of}} the tolled exits for passenger cars and other two-axle vehicles (as of July 1, 2015). Vehicles with more than two <b>axles</b> pay a higher toll at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of American made vehicles continued to use simple Live rear <b>axles</b> into the 1980s, but Americans could access four wheel Independent suspension technology on imported cars, like the 1952 Volkswagen Beetle, 1961 Jaguar E-Type, and 1968 Datsun 510.|$|E
5000|$|A live <b>axle</b> is {{probably}} the most common <b>axle</b> setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the <b>axle</b> spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the <b>axle.</b> Since the <b>axle</b> spins, bearings are mounted to the swing arm frame. This is a very simple <b>axle</b> setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the <b>axle</b> and are held in place by set screws or locking collars. The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the <b>axle</b> spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the <b>axle.</b> This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the <b>axle</b> and the components.|$|R
50|$|Some {{dump trucks}} and {{trailers}} may be configured with a lift <b>axle</b> (also {{known as an}} airlift <b>axle</b> or drop <b>axle),</b> which may be mechanically raised or lowered. The <b>axle</b> is lowered to increase the weight capacity, or to distribute {{the weight of the}} cargo over more wheels, for example to cross a weight restricted bridge. When not needed, the <b>axle</b> is lifted off the ground to save wear on the tires and <b>axle,</b> and to increase traction in the remaining wheels. Lifting an <b>axle</b> also alleviates lateral scrubbing of the additional <b>axle</b> in very tight turns, allowing the vehicle to turn more readily. In some situations removal of pressure from the additional <b>axle</b> is necessary for the vehicle to complete a turn at all.|$|R
50|$|The Ford 8.8 is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} Ford Motor Company at the Sterling <b>Axle</b> Plant in Sterling Heights, MI. It {{was first used}} in model year 1983 Ford trucks. The <b>axle</b> was developed to replace the Ford 9-inch <b>axle.</b> This <b>axle</b> is still in production today {{for a variety of}} Ford vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Adhesion problems. The lighter loading {{on their}} driving <b>axles</b> {{meant that they}} were even more prone to wheelslip than the Merchant Navy class, {{requiring}} very careful control when starting a heavy train. Once underway they were noted for their free running, excellent steam production and rapid turn of speed.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, Rogers {{partnered with}} two investors from New York City, Morris Ketchum and Jasper Grosvenor. Jefferson Works was renamed Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor, {{and the company}} began to diversify into the {{railroad}} industry. The company soon manufactured springs, <b>axles</b> and other small parts for railroad use.|$|E
5|$|The armored {{version of}} the Storm 3, {{designed}} for protection against light weapon threats, incorporates a heavy duty transfer case and a specially designed suspension system which includes heavy duty springs (front - coil, rear - leaf) and shock absorbers, together with rigid heavy duty <b>axles</b> allowing for a smooth and safe ride on both rough terrain as well as regular highways.|$|E
25|$|Commercial motor {{vehicles}} {{are subject to}} various state and federal laws regarding limitations on truck length (measured from bumper to bumper), width, and truck <b>axle</b> length (measured from <b>axle</b> to <b>axle</b> or fifth wheel to <b>axle</b> for trailers).|$|R
50|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 35 is an {{automotive}} <b>axle</b> {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation since 1985 when American Motors (AMC) sold its <b>axle</b> tooling equipment to Dana. The <b>axle</b> was originally named an AMC-15 {{when it was}} first made in 1962. Dana upgraded the <b>axle,</b> and made IFS and Twin Traction Beam front <b>axle</b> variations, as well.|$|R
50|$|The Ram 3500 {{has three}} <b>axle</b> ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three <b>axle</b> ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear <b>axle</b> is a Dana S 110. The front <b>axle</b> on 4x4 models is {{manufactured}} by Magna, while 2-wheel-drive models {{just have a}} solid, non-drive <b>axle.</b>|$|R
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two <b>axles.</b> Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs warning of penalty charges.|$|E
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the diesel-electric locomotives that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to electric traction motors connected to the <b>axles</b> in the train's front truck.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more <b>axles</b> must be added, the distance between <b>axles</b> must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>axle</b> {{track in}} {{automobiles}} and other wheeled vehicles which {{have two or}} more wheels on an <b>axle,</b> is {{the distance between the}} centerline of two roadwheels on the same <b>axle.</b> In a case of the <b>axle</b> with dual wheels, the centerline {{in the middle of the}} dual wheel is used for the <b>axle</b> track specification.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Axle</b> loads: Front <b>axle</b> - laden, 7010 kg; unladen, 5860 kg. Middle {{and rear}} <b>axle</b> - laden, 4385 kg; unladen, 2720 kg.|$|R
50|$|The <b>axle</b> load of a {{wheeled vehicle}} {{is the total}} weight felt by the roadway for all wheels {{connected}} to a given <b>axle.</b> Viewed another way, it is the fraction of total vehicle weight resting on a given <b>axle.</b> <b>Axle</b> load is an important design consideration in the engineering of roadways and railways, as both are designed to tolerate a maximum weight-per-axle (<b>axle</b> load); exceeding the maximum rated <b>axle</b> load will cause damage to the roadway or rail tracks.|$|R
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two <b>axles,</b> were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} two <b>axles,</b> such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} <b>axles,</b> desired layout, wheelbase and with conventional or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s the Dana 70U or Dana 70B was offered. GM, Ford and Dodge {{all used}} this <b>axle.</b> This <b>axle</b> had a smaller pinion bearing and mostly have 32 spline <b>axle</b> shafts. The Dana 70U and Dana 70B both have gross <b>axle</b> weight ratings of 7500 lbs. The 2nd {{generation}} Dodge Ram trucks consistently feature this <b>axle</b> in the 2500 trucks with the Diesel or V10 and automatic transmission. This <b>axle</b> {{was designed for}} single rear wheel applications.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} an Iterated Local Search {{algorithm}} for the capacitated {{vehicle routing problem}} with sequence-based pallet loading and <b>axle</b> weight constraints is presented. <b>Axle</b> weight limits impose a great challenge for transportation companies. Yet, {{the literature on the}} incorporation of <b>axle</b> weight constraints in vehicle routing models is very scarce. The effect of introducing <b>axle</b> weight constraints in a CVRP on total routing cost is analyzed. Results show that integrating <b>axle</b> weight constraints does not lead to a large cost increase. However, not including <b>axle</b> weight constraints in the planning process may induce major <b>axle</b> weight violations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The solid <b>axle</b> Dana 50 {{was used}} in the Ford F-250 and the F-350 from 1998 to 2002. This <b>axle</b> was also the only OEM <b>axle</b> used in Four-wheel drive Ford Excursions. The GAWR of a solid <b>axle</b> Dana 50 is 5000 lbs.|$|R
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's <b>axles</b> could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all <b>axles</b> free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the wheels on both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures {{featured}} in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including Clifford D. Simak, Piers Anthony, David Brin, K. A. Applegate, Philip Pullman, and Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen. Some of these works address the developmental and biomechanical constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from arthritic <b>axles,</b> and Pullman's Mulefa are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they coevolved.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub <b>axles</b> attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
50|$|Some {{trailers}} {{support a}} normal <b>axle</b> on two sides, others mount the wheel off one {{side with a}} stub <b>axle</b> (a one sided <b>axle).</b>|$|R
50|$|The F94HA (F94HA6x2NA) was an {{articulated}} chassis with remotely mounted Voith gearbox, leaf-spring suspension {{on the front}} <b>axle</b> and air suspension on both drive (2nd <b>axle)</b> and trailer <b>axle</b> (3rd <b>axle).</b> It {{is known as a}} 'puller' artic, where no hydraulic articulation control is needed.|$|R
