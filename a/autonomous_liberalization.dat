40|$|While greater {{focus has}} been cast on {{analysis}} of policy changes affecting trade in goods {{in the aftermath of}} the financial crisis, little is known about the direction of policies affecting trade in services. On the basis of information contained in the I-TIP Services database, this paper provides an overview of the evolution of services trade policies since 2000, where policy changes - whether towards more liberalization or more protection - tend to be less easily reversible and to have a greater impact. Has protectionism increased {{in the aftermath of the}} crisis? Which countries, sectors and modes of supply have been associated with most trade facilitating and trade-restrictive measures? The evidence gathered contradicts in many respects basic political economy expectations. Indeed, the countries, sectors and modes of supply where liberalizing and protectionist measures have been implemented are not necessarily those one would have assumed. Most importantly, trade-facilitating measures have clearly outweighed trade-restrictive ones over the recent period, including after the onset of the crisis. This strong push towards <b>autonomous</b> <b>liberalization</b> bodes well for trade negotiations on trade in services. The undertaking of greater commitments would bring benefits by consolidating this recent liberalization and by helping to reduce non-negligible outbursts of protectionism that have been witnessed over the last years. However, bilateral and plurilateral agreements, because of their limited country coverage, would only capture a fraction of the recent <b>autonomous</b> <b>liberalization</b> and, similarly, only help prevent part of the protectionist measures springing up...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), an agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Jamaica. In its analysis, it considers both the island's existing and former foreign trade policy, as well as the progressive trade liberalization being undertaken within the Caribbean Single Market and Economy under CARICOM and its regionally devised policy initiatives. Having followed a fairly liberal path in its trade relations since 1991, the provisions in domestic law which accommodate or hinder liberalization are referred to. Negotiation strategies for future rounds of the GATS are another important aspect of the thesis. This closely follows the schedule of commitments made under the GATS, taking into account recent instances of <b>autonomous</b> <b>liberalization,</b> including those taken in the telecommunications industry. Finally, a critical look is taken at the dispute resolution process of the WTO {{to determine the extent to}} which the trading interests of a developing microstate such as Jamaica are protected by this system...|$|E
40|$|As {{each new}} round of {{multilateral}} trade negotiations approaches, there is a demand for a negotiating rule that would give credit for <b>autonomous</b> <b>liberalization.</b> This Paper shows that the desirability and feasibility of such a rule depends on when it is instituted. A credit rule established {{at the beginning of}} a round of negotiations has primarily a distributional effect, favouring those who have already undertaken liberalization. The implementation of such a rule relies on the generosity of those who have not liberalized. We propose instead the establishment of a credit rule at the end of a round of negotiations, which creates an ex ante assurance that any unilateral liberalization will receive credit in the next round. Such a rule would help induce and/or enhance liberalization between negotiating rounds by reducing the gains from retaining protection as negotiating currency. Moreover, it leads to lower intertemporal average protection in all countries under plausible conditions. Most importantly, such an ex ante rule does not rely on altruism to be generally acceptable.

40|$|Overwhelming {{evidence}} links {{openness and}} economic growth. In recent years {{many developing countries}} have attempted to liberalize their trade and investment regimes, mostly through <b>autonomous</b> unilateral <b>liberalization.</b> At the same time, {{a growing number of}} governments have begun to explore and participate in regional trading agreements. The agreements grant reciprocal trade preferences to participating countries, resulting in discrimination against nonmembers. The causes and consequences of regional integration have given rise to an extensive and vigorous debate among both scholars and policymakers. However, the quality of this debate has been seriously hampered by the absence of clear analytical models and empirical evidence on many of the factors under discussion. Few of the recent arguments in favor of regional integration arrangements have been satisfactorily formalized or tested. To address some of these issues, a World Bank research program focuses on new and developing country aspects of regionalism. The program explores lacunae in the traditional static analysis of regional integration arrangements; addresses the dynamic effects of integration, the economics of deep integration, and the politics and political economy of regional integration arrangements; and compares regionalism with multilateralism. The articles in this symposium address the topics of dynamics, politics, and political economy in regional integration agreements...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyLatin American {{countries}} {{rank among}} those that have displayed {{the greatest amount of}} rule-making activism towards foreign direct investment in recent decades. The region has witnessed a steady opening of investment regimes. Alongside domestic (or <b>autonomous)</b> investment regime <b>liberalization,</b> Latin American countries have engaged in a large number of international negotiations dealing with investment matters. Virtually all of them are today members of the World Trade Organization, are party to one or more regional integration agreements featuring comprehensive disciplines on the protection and liberalization of foreign investors and their investments, and are parties to numerous bilateral investment treaties. This paper depicts the changing international landscape of investment rule-making from a Latin American perspective. It does so by looking first at the recent evolution of investment rules at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, pointing out differences and synergies between these closely intertwinned processes and the role that Latin American countries have had in shaping them. Against the backdrop of repeated failures at developing a comprehensive set of investment disciplines at the multilateral level, the paper reviews the main arguments that have been recently advanced in favor and against global rules for investment. The paper dissects the main reasons why investment fell off the negotiating agenda of the Doha Development Agenda at the WTO. It concludes by drawing a number of policy lessons regarding the most optimal institutional settings in which to pursue various elements of investment rule-making and sketches a few forward-looking scenarios on investment rule-making at the multilateral level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{emphasizes}} that economic nationalism in India both contributed to and coexists with the liberalization process initiated since 1991, which marked a decisive break in India’s economic policy {{and pushed her}} towards increased integration with the global economy. It is however an inherently more exclusive form of economic nationalism in which capitalist priorities press down harder on an already constrained state. India’s capitalists embraced rather than resisted the liberalization process, in contrast to their active support for a strategy of autonomous development at independence. The paper focuses on this shift in the outlook of the capitalist class represented by India’s big business and tries to identify the reasons why it initially emerged and why it has gathered strength over time. The paper argues that this transformation reflected the development and evolution of Indian capitalism resulting from industrialization under the older <b>autonomous</b> strategy. Embracing <b>liberalization</b> became both possible and necessary for India’s capitalists. The shift in the Indian state’s policy thus {{was a response to}} the imperatives of national capitalist development, and the state has continued to assist Indian capital’s growth and development in different ways. Indian capital has in fact gained increased leverage with the state and with its support has grown rapidly and stepped on to the global stage. In the process it has also changed – become less industrial, and more integrated into global production and financial systems. This growth and transformation of Indian big business in turn has reinforced its support for liberalization. ...|$|R
