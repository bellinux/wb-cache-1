25|$|Grissom and {{his team}} found the washed-up rock star dead in his kitchen in the episode Built to Kill, Part 2. His body was sprawled {{in a chair and}} leaning {{forwards}} onto the table. They determined that {{the cause of death was}} a single blow delivered to the back of a head with <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>pin.</b> The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} under the player's control {{throughout}} the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting {{how much of a}} given resource is transported to a given building, under six separate headings; foodstuff, grain, iron, coal, boards and water. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a bakery, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith.|$|E

25|$|Max Berfelde, Lothar's father, {{was already}} {{a member of the}} Nazi Party by the late 1920s and he had become a party leader in Mahlsdorf. In 1942 he forced Lothar to join the Hitler Youth. They often quarrelled, but the {{situation}} escalated in 1944 when her mother left the family during the evacuation. Max demanded that Lothar choose between parents, threatening her with a gun and leaving her in a room with an hour to choose; when he came in to kill her, she struck him with <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> and killed him. In January 1945, after several weeks in a psychiatric institution, Lothar was sentenced by a court in Berlin to four years detention as an anti-social juvenile delinquent. She did not serve the full term because the jails were opened {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

[...] Magnani and Quinn did feud in private outside view of the cameras, however, and their animosity spilled over into their scenes:"By the time the movie makers were ready to shoot the fight scene, the stars were ready too. Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>pin,</b> but with her foot; she kicked so hard she broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. 'That's not in the script', Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, 'I'm supposed to win this fight, remember?" ...|$|E

50|$|Another variety, the Hardangerlefse (from Hardanger in Norway), is {{made from}} yeast-risen Graham flour or a fine ground whole wheat flour (krotekake). The dough is rolled with <b>a</b> {{conventional}} <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> (and much more flour) until it is thin and does not stick to the surface. It is then cut with <b>a</b> grooved <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity. The lefse is cooked at high temperature (400 °F or 205 °C) until browned, and then left to dry. It can also be freeze dried by repeatedly freezing and thawing.|$|R
50|$|To create dhebra, {{sufficient}} water and salt is mixed in millet flour {{to make a}} dough.

50|$|Troccoli is a spaghetti-like pasta {{which is}} {{traditionally}} processed by the so-called troccolaturo or troccolo, <b>a</b> grooved <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> which cuts {{the dough into}} regular strips about 3-5 mm thick (0,11811-0,19685 inches): {{as a result of}} the pressure employed on the dough, the cross section of each strip will be either square or slightly oval, according to the shape of the grooves themselves (they can be either flat or pointy).|$|R
50|$|A chakla is an Indian kitchen utensil. It is a flat, usually {{circular}} board {{used with}} a belan (<b>an</b> Indian style <b>rolling</b> <b>pin),</b> for <b>rolling</b> kneaded dough into chapatis, the round unleavened flatbread. It is commonly made of various types of stone or wood. The weight adds to the stability, and reduces slippage during rolling.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> roller docker, <b>rolling</b> docker, dough docker, roto-fork, {{or simply}} docker is a food {{preparation}} utensil which resembles either <b>a</b> small, spiked <b>rolling</b> <b>pin,</b> or <b>a</b> small rotary tiller. It {{is used to}} pierce bread dough, cracker dough, pizza dough or pastry dough to prevent over rising or blistering. This specialized tool is more commonly found in professional bakeries than in homes that only do light or occasional baking.|$|R
50|$|The troccolaturo or troccolo {{is an old}} kitchen utensil in use {{for several}} centuries in Italy. In his Opera dell'arte del cucinare, {{published}} in 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi mentions this tool {{under the name of}} ferro da maccheroni ("macaroni iron") and shows an engraving that clearly lends us an idea of what this kitchenware looked like in ancient times. It was basically <b>a</b> grooved <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> made of metal, though the metal was gradually replaced by hardwoods and today this tool comes in both materials, especially in beech wood or bronze.|$|R
5000|$|To make springerle, very cold, stiff {{dough is}} rolled thin and pressed into a mold, or {{impressed}} by <b>a</b> specialized, carved <b>rolling</b> <b>pin.</b> The dough is unmolded {{and then left}} to dry for about 24 hours before being baked at a low temperature on greased, anise-dusted baking sheets. The drying period allows time for the pattern {{in the top of}} the cookie to set, so that the cookie has a [...] "pop-up" [...] effect from leavening, producing the characteristic [...] "foot" [...] along the edges, below the molded surface.|$|R
50|$|In jewelry making, it can {{be rolled}} into balls and formed into beads, or pressed into various shapes.

50|$|At its simplest, {{spaghetti}} can {{be formed}} using {{no more than}} <b>a</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> and a knife.

Commercial versions of 'fresh' spaghetti are manufactured.|$|E
30|$|The NFC films used in {{this work}} were {{prepared}} as described elsewhere [33]. In brief, bleached hardwood pulp (birch) was mechanically processed using a Masuko grinder with five passes and then further disintegrated by a M 110 P fluidizer (Microfluidics corp., Newton, MA, USA) with six passes. The produced NFC-gel was then filtered to remove the excess of water with a filter membrane using 2.5  bar. The film was then rolled five times with <b>a</b> smooth metal <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> to further consolidate {{the structure of the}} film. Finally the prepared films were dried between clean blotting boards (highly absorbent paper sheets) under external pressing and stored under ambient conditions until used.|$|R
50|$|This move is {{achieved}} when a wrestler wraps a forward-facing opponent's legs {{around his waist}} (either by standing behind an opponent who is lying face-first on the mat or by catching a charging opponent), then the wrestler would apply a gutwrench hold and lift the opponent {{up off the ground}} into the air, then either continue lifting and fall backwards to wheelbarrow suplex, or forcing the opponent back down to the mat to hit a wheelbarrow facebuster. This can also can be a transition hold for counterattacks that see the wrestler (who is being wheelbarrowed) hit many throws and drops like a DDT or <b>a</b> bulldog and <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> combinations.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} making springerle {{is to not}} chill the dough at all. Commonly, after mixing all the {{ingredients}} together, one would cover a surface with flour, and use <b>a</b> regular <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> (also covered in flour) to roll out the dough to about half-an-inch of thickness. Flour would be spread over the top surface of the rolled-out dough, and also on the specialized Springerle <b>rolling</b> <b>pin.</b> One would whack the Springerle <b>rolling</b> <b>pin</b> against one's hand a few times, to dislodge any flour caked into the designs on it, and then proceed to carefully but firmly roll out the molds. One uses a knife to cut out the small, rectangular cookies (often 2x1 inches), and place them on a wooden board to dry overnight (or for at least twelve hours). As this process is repeated, the dough gets more brittle due to the added flour and doesn't hold the molds as well. Therefore, {{it is important to}} roll the dough out in small batches (instead of all at once), to keep the moisture in so the cookies hold together. Anise seed is sprinkled on the baking sheets just before putting them in the oven (about ten minutes is usually sufficient, but the cooking time also depends on thickness). 1-2 teaspoons of anise extract can also be added to the dough to increase the taste (which is rather like licorice), and the amount of cookies varies on the thickness. The usual recipe with 4 eggs and 3-4 cups of flour can yield anywhere from 60-144 cookies, depending on thickness and the experience of the maker.|$|R
