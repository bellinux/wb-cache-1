40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 46 - 52) <b>Agglutination</b> <b>of</b> S- 180 ascites {{tumor cells}} mediated by Concanavalin A (ConA) and biologically active succinyl and acetyl ConA derivatives was quantitatively measured and compared, using an electronic particle counter assay. ConA causes <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> tumor cells in vitro. Compared to ConA, succinyl ConA (SConA) and acetyl ConA (AConA) cause a substantial reduction in agglutination. Agglutination mediated by ConA, SConA and AConA {{was affected by}} pretreatment of the tumor cells with cytochalasin B (cyto B) and colchicine. Cyto B causes inhibition of cellular microfilaments while colchicine causes inhibition of microtubules. ConA mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> cyto B pretreated tumor cells was greater than ConA mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> untreated cells. <b>Agglutination</b> mediated by SConA and AConA contrasted sharply from the ConA profile. SConA and AConA mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> cyto B pretreated tumor cells was less than SConA and AConA mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> untreated cells. ConA mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> tumor cells was not substantially changed by colchicine pretreatment; however, reduced <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> colchicine pretreated tumor cells with SConA and AConA was observed. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide {{does not appear to}} affect agglutination, while reduction in temperature decreases agglutination. This decrease in agglutination may be related to reduced ConA receptor site clustering which is necessary for effective intercellular connections. These results indicate that derivatized ConA may have a reduced binding affinity for ConA receptor sites on the cell surface. This may reduce the clustering of ConA receptor sites and therefore reduce <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> these cells. Although microfilaments and microtubules have not been shown as fine structural elements in these cells, the results suggest that ConA receptor sites on the cell surface may be associated with microfilaments and microtubules...|$|R

Concanavalin A-mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> hepatoma cells at 25 degrees proceeded with biphasic kinetics (first and second stages <b>of</b> <b>agglutination),</b> while no appreciable <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> liver cells was observed in the presence of concanavalin A. The plasma membranes from the liver and hepatoma cells were similarly agglutinated with concanavalin A at 25 degrees but not at 0 degrees. The concanavalin A-mediated membrane agglutination proceeded with monophasic kinetics and was incomplete. Colchicine inhibited preferentially the second stage <b>of</b> concanavalin A-mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> hepatoma cells, but it did not affect the concanavalin A-mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> plasma membranes of both types of cells...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{attachment}} of non-encapsulated cryptococci to macrophages is highly dependent on opsonizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and that cryptococcal polysaccharide inhibits the attachment phase of phagocytosis. We investigated various mechanisms by which cryptococcal polysaccharide might interfere with the opsonizing action of IgG. Cryptococcal polysaccharide did not appreciably prevent binding of opsonizing IgG to the yeast. Furthermore, cryptococcal polysaccharide acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the opsonizing action of IgG. These experiments suggested that cell wall-bound IgG is masked in some manner such that it is unable to participate in Fc-mediated phagocytosis. This appeared to be the case, since cryptococcal polysaccharode inhibited <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> IgG-opsonized yeast cells by antiserum to IgG. There was good dose-response correlation between the amount of polysaccharide needed to inhibit phagocytosis of non-encapsulated Cryptococcus neoformans and the amount of polysaccharide needed to prevent <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> IgG-opsonized cryptococci by antiserum to IgG. The ability of cryptococcal polysaccharide to prevent <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> IgG-opsonized cryptococci by antiserum to IgG was lost if dextran, a substance known to enhance <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> several particles, was incorporated into the medium...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} of 453 Escherichia coli strains to agglutinate erythrocytes and yeast cells and to attach to human urinary tract epithelial cells was tested. The strains were {{isolated from the}} urine of patients with acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, or asymptomatic bacteriuria and from the stools of healthy school children. Three main patterns of hemagglutination were found: (i) mannose-resistant <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> human erythrocytes alone or simultaneously with mannose-sensitive <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> guinea pig erythrocytes; (ii) only mannose-sensitive <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> guinea pig and other erythrocytes; and (iii) no agglutination. Strains with mannose-resistant <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> human erythrocytes alone or in combination with mannose-sensitive hemagglutination attached in high numbers to human urinary tract epithelial cells. Bacteria inducing only mannose-sensitive hemagglutination attached in low numbers, and non-agglutinating strains did not bind to the urinary tract epithelial cells. The bacterial surface antigen(s) mediating mannose-resistant hemagglutination of human erythrocytes and attachment to human urinary tract epithelial cells may be one factor selecting for E. coli from among the fecal flora which infect the urinary tract. The highest proportion of strains with this property was found among acute pyelonephritis isolates (77 %), and the lowest proportion of strains with this property was found among normal fecal E. coli (16 %) ...|$|R

Cells {{that had been}} exposed to GM 1 were agglutinated, but agglutination was not observed when cells {{had been exposed to}} other gangliosides (GM 2, GM 3, GD 1 a, GD 1 b). Choleragen-dependent <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> liposomes was slightly less specific, because liposomes containing either GM 1 or GD 1 b, but neither GM 2, GD 1 a, nor GM 3 were agglutinated. The oligosaccharide isolated from GM 1 inhibited both the <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> cells and liposomes containing GM 1 and the binding of choleragen to liposomes containing GM 1. Galactose and sialic acid were less effective inhibitors <b>of</b> liposomal <b>agglutination</b> and did not inhibit cellular <b>agglutination</b> or binding <b>of</b> choleragen to liposomes. Liposomal agglutination was dependent on choleragen concentration and occurred with the B but not the A protomer of choleragen.

The <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> D. immitis microfilariae is a specific phenomenon due to some immune complexes formed with the anti-microfilarial antibody, heat-instable factor(s) and excretory-secretory products of microfilariae.

This gave three classes of glycans (polysaccharides, endoglycosidase H-resistant glycopeptides, and endoglycosidase H-released oligosaccharides), which were tested {{for their ability}} to block <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> amoebae from vegetative, aggregation (8 -hr), and late-aggregation (13 -hr) stages of development. The endoglycosidase H-resistant glycopeptides from 8 -hr cells inhibited <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> disaggregated 8 -hr cells but not vegetative or 13 -hr cells. The 8 -hr polysaccharide and endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides did not inhibit. The glycopeptides from 8 -hr cells were resolved into five species by electrophoresis in borate-containing buffer. Two of these had agglutination-inhibiting activity, and three did not. None of the glycan fractions from vegetative or 13 -hr cells inhibited <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> vegetative, 8 -, or 13 -hr cells. These data implicate specific cell surface glycans in aggregation-stage intercellular cohesion and suggest that both these glycans and receptors for them are developmentally regulated...|$|R

Although Rosendal (1) has demonstrated the <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> Group A streptococci by human sera, which may be dependent upon anti-Group A agglufinins, these results are difficult to interpret because <b>of</b> frequent spontaneous <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> the cell suspension, and because agglutination may be dependent upon components of the cell wall other than the group carbohydrate. Group A antibodies have been detected in an occasional human serum by precipitin methods (2, 3) {{but it has not}} proved feasible to devise a quantitative estimate of antibodies with these techniques. This report describes the detection of human anti-Group A agglutinins by a modification of the Coombs indirect agglutination test which employs purified Group A cell walls.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{glutaraldehyde}} fixation on lectin-mediated <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> murine leukaemia (GRSL) cells was investigated using 2 assay methods which differed in the shear forces {{to which the}} agglutinated cells were subjected. First, lectin and cells were allowed to interact under conditions in which shear forces were minimized and the degree <b>of</b> <b>agglutination</b> was evaluated microscopically by the appearance {{and size of the}} cell aggregates. This assay demonstrated that concanavalin A (con A) -, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) - or Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA^-mediated cytoagglutination was unaffected (WGA and RCAj) or somewhat enhanced (con A) by prior fixation of the cells with glutaraldehyde. Secondly, an electronic particle counter was used to measure the disappearance of single cells and concomitant appearance of cell aggregates {{as a function of the}} lectin concentration. In this assay, in which the aggregated cells are subjected to significant shear forces during dilution and cell counting, <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> GRSL cells by each of the 3 lectins was drastically inhibited by prior fixation of the cells with glutaraldehyde. This assay also demonstrated enhanced nonlectin-induced cell aggregation after fixation.

40|$|Type- 1 fimbriae are {{associated}} with most Salmonella enterica serovars and are an essential factor for host colonization. Mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), a prebiotic that is agglutinated by type- 1 fimbriae, are proposed for the control of enterobacteria colonization and may be an alternative to Salmonella control in pigs. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the capability of porcine Salmonella strains to adhere to MOS in vitro. A total of 108 strains of Salmonella sp. isolated from carrier pigs were evaluated for the amplification of fimA and fimH genes, <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> MOS and hemagglutination. In all tested strains, amplicons of expected size were detected for both fimA and fimH gene. In the hemagglutination assays, 31 (28. 7 %) strains presented mannose-sensitive <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> erythrocytes, indicating that the strains were expressing type- 1 fimbriae.

40|$|Radiolabeled monomeric human beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 m) {{was tested}} for binding to Streptococcus mutans strains in buffers {{containing}} 1 mM calcium (Ca 2 +). Binding {{was seen to}} strains with a previously established binding capacity of aggregated beta 2 m. Monomeric beta 2 m agglutinated beta 2 m-binding strains when Ca 2 + was present. At Ca 2 + concentrations of 1. 4 mM, 0. 032 micrograms of monomeric beta 2 m per ml caused bacterial agglutination. Parotid saliva was gel filtered on a Sephadex G- 75 column, and low-molecular-weight fractions containing beta 2 m could agglutinate S. mutans cells. Five of six strains that could bind beta 2 m were agglutinated by these fractions, but only one of five nonbinding strains was. All strains tested were agglutinated by void volume fractions. A new method for the measurement of turbidity in bacterial agglutination inhibition experiments with parotid saliva was used. Suspensions containing parotid saliva, bacteria, and control serum were directly compared in a spectrophotometer with test suspensions containing goat anti-human beta 2 m, bacteria, and saliva. Thus, the spectrophotometer directly read the difference in <b>agglutination</b> <b>of</b> the two suspensions, {{and the result was}} presented as one curve by the recorder. <b>Agglutination</b> <b>of</b> five beta 2 m-binding strains of S. mutans was inhibited or decreased by the addition of goat anti-human beta 2 m as compared with control serum.
