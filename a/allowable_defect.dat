40|$|Nowadays one can derive <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> {{dimensions}} for {{a specific}} pipeline based on a deterministic engineering critical assessment (ECA). The question is whether these defect dimensions {{can be used as}} non-destructive examination (NDE) acceptance criteria (AC) {{for a specific}} pipeline or how do the <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> dimensions relate to the performance of the NDE technique. The <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> dimensions (the acceptance criteria) should depend on the performance of the NDE technique(s) used, i. e. the probability of detection and the sizing accuracy. The effect of the NDE technique on the probability of failure can only be assessed by probabilistic fracture mechanics analyses. To avoid performing probabilistic analyses for every configuration, a methodology has been developed to derive acceptance criteria for pipeline girth welds such that a high integrity level (low probability of failure) is maintained. In this methodology the acceptance criteria for defects are not fixed but ‘flexible’. The acceptance criteria are based on the <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> dimensions determined by an ECA and the performance of the NDE technique. The performance of the NDE technique determines the safety factor. The safety factor is to be applied on the <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> height. A ‘good’ performance of a NDE technique allows for a smaller safety factor on the defect dimensions, resulting in fewer repairs but without a loss in the integrity level. However a ‘bad’ NDE performance results in a larger safety factor resulting in smaller <b>allowable</b> <b>defect...</b>|$|E

40|$|Within a stress-based design context, {{different}} codified engineering critical {{assessment procedures}} {{are available for}} defect assessment. This paper aims at comparing the recently updated EPRG Tier 2 guidelines with the Canadian CSA Z 662 Annex K procedure. Therefore, the requirements for both procedure are discussed and the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> dimensions are graphically compared. It is observed {{that the use of}} the EPRG guidelines is significantly more restricted in terms of steel grades and pipe geometry. However, within the limits of the EPRG's applicability, the CSA procedure requires significantly more material testing, while resulting in (extremely) low defect acceptance...|$|E
50|$|Based on the American West Coast Lumber Inspection Bureau (WCLIB) grading rules, {{there is}} only one grade of stud: STUD. A stud is graded for {{vertical}} application and its stress requirements and <b>allowable</b> visual <b>defects</b> reflect that application. A stud is most similar to a #2 grade, which is held to a higher standard during grading. The biggest difference between the two is the frequency, placement and size of knots and overall allowable wane.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{surveys the}} {{concepts}} and analysis techniques available for more rational {{assessment of the}} significance cf weld defects. In addition, a systems approach to brittle fractui revention that can be practically applied to welded structures is developed. The need for analysis techniques that provide a more rational and rigorous means of assessing the significance of weld defects is shown to be met {{by the use of}} fracture mechanics technology. Through the use of fracture mechanics analysis techniques, the size of the maximum <b>allowable</b> veld <b>defect</b> can be established and used as an acceptance criterion for weld defects. Critical flaw sizes can also be determined under conditions of fatigue and environment-induced crack growt...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{aesthetic}} and structural advantages, tubular space truss structures are enjoying increasing popularity in modern bridge construction. The use of cast steel nodes for the joints between the circular hollow section members is also becoming increasingly popular. The fatigue design of such joints however requires additional knowledge {{with respect to}} their fatigue resistance. The present work deals with the global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes used in longitudinal truss girders of steel-concrete composite bridges. The global fatigue behaviour of cast steel nodes in a truss girder is quantified on the basis of experimental investigations. The relative influence of the resistance of the cast steel node and the resistance of the welds is analysed as a function of various parameters. An economically optimal fatigue design consists of adapting the fatigue resistance of the cast node to that of the welds. The experimental results show very clearly that the fatigue behaviour is governed by the welds in all tested configurations. Their fatigue behaviour is therefore investigated in a research program conducted simultaneously. The present work concentrates on the adaptation of the resistance of the cast steel nodes to that of the welds. Consequently, <b>allowable</b> initial casting <b>defect</b> sizes must be defined {{as a function of the}} required fatigue resistance of the welds. Using a numerical boundary element model, they are calculated for cast steel nodes in a typical steel-concrete composite bridge. The results show that brittle failure of a node containing cracks does not occur. A crack depth equal to 90 % of the wall thickness at the crack location is therefore chosen as the failure criterion, assuming that a through-thickness crack is unacceptable. Varying between 28 and 88 % of the wall thickness, the resulting <b>allowable</b> initial casting <b>defect</b> sizes are very large. Aiming at a general application for steel-concrete composite bridges, the results of the numerical investigations are represented by an approximate formula for the stress intensity factor based on a constant correction factor. This approximation results in a considerable simplification of the procedure for the fatigue design of cast steel nodes established for the aforementioned typical composite bridge. The approximate formula is used to perform a parametric study. The influences of the utilisation ratio under traffic and fatigue loads, the cast steel fracture toughness and yield strength and the node dimensions on the defect size are described. Assuming a fracture toughness likely to be encountered in practice and a mean utilisation ratio of the node as well as a range of node dimensions, the <b>allowable</b> initial casting <b>defect</b> sizes are quantified. The present work shows that the fatigue resistance of the welded joints needs to be improved substantially in order to benefit from the high fatigue resistance of the cast nodes. Weld details including a backing ring offer a higher fatigue resistance than those without. Using the proposed design concept, <b>allowable</b> initial <b>defect</b> sizes in cast steel nodes can be estimated as a function of the required fatigue resistance...|$|R
40|$|A strain-based flaw {{assessment}} procedure {{is recommended for}} girth welded pipelines subjected to large deformations. To evaluate the <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> dimensions, the tearing resistance needs to be characterized. This paper investigates the effect of weld metal strength mismatch on the resistance curve using Single Edge Notched Tension (SENT) specimens. Several advanced measurement techniques are applied during the tests {{in order to obtain}} a continuous measurement of crack extension and to visualize the deformation fields near the crack. The resistance curves are determined using a single specimen technique. The unloading compliance method and the potential drop method result in similar predictions of ductile crack extension, yielding similar resistance curves. Next to these measurements, the full field deformations are determined using digital image correlation. The experiments indicate that the position of the applied notch in the weld has the potential to influence the strain fields...|$|E
40|$|When {{pushed to}} the limits of their {{detection}} capability, NDE systems do not produce consistent hit/miss indications. Their capability of detecting small defects is therefore expressed in terms of POD. An adequate NDE system is required to ensure the structural integrity. In conventional signal response analysis, the POD is expressed {{as a function of the}} defect size, and its adequacy for the inspection task is tested against the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> size which will not undermine the structural integrity. Analyses of modern structures show that other parameters, beside the defect size, can both significantly influence the POD and determine the severity of the defect for the structure. Within the multi-parameter reliability analysis, the POD is expressed as a function of those influencing parameters. When determining the adequacy of the NDE system, the capability of detecting a defect has to be expressed and tested against the critical value of exactly that parameter that determines defects severity for the structure. Failing to do so can lead to a rejection of the healthy, or acceptance of the bad part. The principle is demonstrated on the example of the Transmit-Receive Longitudinal (TRL) ultrasonic inspection of the iron cast component for semi-elliptical surface defects...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{high strength}} steel is susceptible to delayed failure caused by the absorption of hydrogen produced either during cathodic charging or electroplating. When 0. 8 %C and AISI 4340 steel are subjected to constant load testing, {{a wide range of}} failure times is observed. By applying Weibull statistics small changes in experimental parameters such as heat-treatment are detected readily and are explained in the terms of hydrogen trapping at microstructural defects. During the electroplating of steel in a double-cell, quantitative measurements are made of the amount of hydrogen permeated. Current densities are measured in the range 2 - 40 mAcm 2 and it is shown that, although the lowest current density produces the most mechanically sound plate, it also causes the largest amount of hydrogen absorption. The nickel deposit is found to act as a reservoir for reversibly trapped hydrogen allowing diffusion to continue into the steel after the cessation of plating. Permeation measurements were taken on AISI 4340 steel using an electrochemical probe developed from the Barnacle Electrode. The effects of cathodically charging and electroplating with nickel are compared. Exposure of the steel to the atmosphere is shown to have an important influence on the hydrogen content after a period of time due to a limited occurrence of corrosion. Various post- plating treatments are commonly used to remove a damaging concentration of hydrogen and the quantitative effects of such treatments are described. Finally, a mathematical model is proposed which explains the reason for the wide spread of delayed failure times. It is found that if the stress intensity necessary to initiate a crack is known and, provided either the nominal stress or the crack size is known, it is possible to calculate either the <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> size or the allowable stress below which cracking is not expected to occur...|$|E
40|$|Formulation of the problem. Significant {{influence}} {{on the quality of}} rolled steel have various defects on its surface, which in its turn inherited from surface defects of billet and possible damage to the surface of rolled steel in the rolling mill line. One of the criteria for assessing the quality indicators of rolled steel is rationing of surface defects [1; 2; 3; 6; 7]. Current status of the issue. Analyzing the different requirements of regulations to the surface quality of the rolled high-carbon steels, we can conclude that the maximum <b>allowable</b> depth of <b>defects</b> on the surface of billet should be in the range of 2. 0 [...] . 5. 0 mm (depending on the section of the billet, method of its production and further the destination) Purpose. Develop a methodology for calculating the maximum <b>allowable</b> depth of <b>defects</b> on the steel billet surface depending on the requirements placed on the surface quality of hot-rolled steel. Results. A simplified method of calculation, allowing at the rated depth of defects {{on the surface of the}} hot-rolled steel to make operatively calculation of the maximum allowable depth of surface defects of steel billets before heating the metal in the heat deformation was developed. The findings shows that the maximum allowable depth of surface defects is reduced with increasing diameter rolled steel, reducing the initial section steel billet and degrees of oxidation of the metal in the heating furnace...|$|R
40|$|Cost-efficient and {{reliable}} heavy haul operation requires {{a minimum of}} operational disturbances. To this end, the current study focuses on wheel load management with the aim to establish wheel load monitoring and mitigation actions (in terms of limits on <b>allowable</b> wheel <b>defects)</b> that minimize traffic disruptions. As a first step, the relation between wheel impact load magnitudes (resulting from the out-of-round wheels) and critical rail crack sizes {{that would result in}} rail breaks is established. Variations in parameters such as track stiffness, rail temperature, impact load characteristics and hanging sleepers etc. are investigated and a “bad case scenario” that implies severe, but realistic operational conditions is established. In this manner allowable wheel impact load magnitudes can be linked to pertinent critical crack sizes that must be identified during inspections. An interesting finding is that thermal stresses have such a major effect that a seasonal variation in allowable wheel load limit seems justified. Predicted critical crack sizes (presuming allowed wheel load magnitudes) are then contrasted to critical crack sizes at operational rail breaks. A large scatter in operational critical crack sizes is found and reasons for this fact are discussed. Finally operational aspects of implementing the suggested limit values are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} thin shell {{structures}} {{with respect to}} elastoplastic buckling requires an extended analysis {{of the influence of}} initial imperfections. For conservative design, the most critical defect should be assumed with the maximum <b>allowable</b> magnitude. This <b>defect</b> is closely related to the initial postbuckling behavior. An algorithm is given for the quasi-static analysis of the postbuckling behavior of structures that exhibit multiple buckling points. the algorithm based upon an energy criterion allows the computation of the critical perturbation which will be employed for the definition of the critical defect. For computational efficiency, the algorithm uses the reduced basis technique with automatic update of the modal basis. The method is applied to the axisymmetric buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression, and conclusions are given for future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{microstructural}} evolution during semiconductor and metallic materials processing is increasingly challenging because of more stringent design specifications. An important {{example is the}} control of defect aggregation in crystalline semiconductor silicon which is used widely as a substrate for microelectronic device fabrication. As device feature lengths shrink, so do the maximum <b>allowable</b> <b>defect</b> cluster sizes. At the nanometer scale, the use of atomistically resolved simulation tools becomes a requirement for process design. ^ In this thesis we apply a bond-counting variant of the lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) method {{to the study of}} vacancy aggregation in bulk crystalline silicon. The process of vacancy aggregation leads to harmful nanovoids that continue to impact device yield and performance in polished silicon wafers. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we address the development of a quantitatively accurate LKMC simulator using a database generated by molecular dynamics simulations for model regression and validation. We find that lattice models such as LKMC, which by definition do not explicitly accommodate off-lattice degrees-of-freedom, are unable to properly describe aggregation dynamics unless special care is applied to include the effects of off-lattice relaxations, especially at elevated temperatures. We show that the developed LKMC model is quantitatively in agreement with the predictions of MD simulations. ^ In the next area of work, we extend the LKMC model to probe the effect of a common impurity in commercial crystalline silicon, namely interstitial oxygen, on the void morphology which is surprisingly rich. A simple trapping model is used to represent the reversible binding between oxygen atoms and vacancies. The resulting LKMC model is able to describe the diverse void morphology that is observed in experimental measurements, further demonstrating the predictive power of the LKMC model developed in this work. ^ In the final section of the thesis, a novel spatial coarse-graining approach is presented which is aimed at greatly extending the scope of the LKMC simulations. While previous approaches for spatial coarse-graining have focused on weakly interacting systems, we develop numerical closure rules that allow for the consideration of strong interactions between particles, which are generally present in aggregating systems. A detailed comparison between the approach developed here and previous literature methods is presented. Although the present coarse-graining work is aimed at an idealized two-dimensional square lattice, our approach should be readily generalizable to more complex lattice structures in three-dimensions. ...|$|E
40|$|Given a {{distribution}} of defects on a structured surface, {{such as those}} represented by 2 -dimensional crystalline materials, liquid crystalline surfaces, and thin sandwiched shells, what is the resulting stress field and the deformed shape? Motivated by this concern, we first classify, and quantify, the translational, rotational, and metrical <b>defects</b> <b>allowable</b> over a broad class of structured surfaces. With an appropriate notion of strain, the defect densities are then shown to appear as sources of strain incompatibility. The strain incompatibility relations, with appropriate kinematical assumptions on the decomposition of strain into elastic and plastic parts, and the stress equilibrium relations, with a suitable choice of material response, provide the necessary equations for determining both the internal stress field and the deformed shape. We demonstrate this by applying our theory to Kirchhoff-Love shells with a kinematics which allows for small in-surface strains but moderately large rotations...|$|R
