500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
60|$|My lady stared <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew. And I didn't know. And that perplexed me afresh.|$|E
60|$|Traddles looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{wondered}} what I was talking about.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dick {{looked hard}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{identify}} <b>me</b> in this character.|$|R
60|$|My {{mother looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she doubted the {{evidence}} of her own senses.|$|R
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could help her}} wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... "She won't talk so pleasantly when I get there," [...] Seth said to himself. [...] "I'd rather take a sound {{flogging}} {{than have}} her look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was a thief!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a stranger; she got up, {{and began to walk}} about the room; then she left the room, and I heard her go out of the house.|$|E
60|$|My {{navigator}} threw a quick, jealous glance <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he distrusted {{the nature}} of the question.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Dick {{secretly}} {{shook his}} head <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he thought there was no getting over this.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted her}} {{face from the}} floor, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she doubted whether she had heard aright.|$|R
60|$|He stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had struck}} him--as {{he might have}} stared, rather, at a child who had struck him, {{undecided}} whether to strike back for the child's good, or to be amused and smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{the girl}} look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a brute beast?" [...] thought he, setting his teeth. [...] "She shall know whether I have a human spirit; and {{the worse for}} her, if it prove {{stronger}} than her own!" ...|$|E
60|$|He smiled <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should {{appreciate}} the joke, {{and it hurt}} me to keep grave, but suspecting what a bad time {{he was going to}} have, I thought I had better not join him in any levity.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she wanted to kiss me.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{her thin}} lips working while she looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{were eager to}} load her with reproaches.|$|R
60|$|They {{all stood}} looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{was waiting for}} something. I folded my arms--tight--and stared back at 'em.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed as {{much when}} I saw {{you talking to}} her. She is a true English lady, heaven bless her! I took the liberty of looking at her painting; and she stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had bitten her." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dropped my}} paddle {{and stood up}} and shouted and waved my hand. Juag and Dian looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had gone {{suddenly}} mad. When I could stop shouting I told them, and they shared my joy and shouted with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "She stared <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{had asked}} for a feather bed. I thought, maybe, she had not heard, so I {{repeated}} it louder. If I had chucked her under the chin {{she could not have}} looked more surprised or indignant.|$|E
6000|$|... "To"--the Story Girl threw {{a defiant}} glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, [...] "You can't spoil the {{surprise}} of THIS, anyway,"--"to--the Awkward Man." ...|$|R
60|$|Ally looked coquettishly <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she did {{not know}} whether she should favor me to that extent, and the young princess was further solicited.|$|R
60|$|As soon as Col. Positive {{had read}} this much, {{he stopped to}} take breath, looking <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> expecting some exclamations of admiration and delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{came home}} once from Eton. But I won't go again till I can {{come home from}} Eton again." [...] Then he altered his tone as he {{continued}} to speak. [...] "People would look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were the wildest beast in the whole collection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And one sensible, {{determined}} girl. Don't look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a murderess! I'm {{your best}} friend--a friend in need. And don't choke down your food. Eat slowly. Fletcherize--chew your food, you know. I know you're nearly famished, {{but you must}} gradually accustom yourself to a proper diet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've implied it. And you've {{been looking}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a leper or {{something}} the Pure Food Committee had condemned. Why? That's what I ask you," [...] said Sam, warming up. This he fancied, {{was the way}} Widgery would have tackled a troublesome client. [...] "Why? Answer me that!" ...|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{wondered}} who on earth I was, but I am sure he saw my soul {{in my face}} and trusted me.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} leg across it, and, sitting astride, he leaned his elbows {{over the back}} and glowered <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he meant to frighten me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so," [...] {{said her}} husband, with another glance <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it were the}} {{greatest}} fun in the world, and he started amiably off.|$|R
60|$|I intimated my {{conviction}} that his love {{was so great}} as {{to be in a}} sense cowardly. The effects of a great passion are unaccountable. It has been known to make a man timid. But Hermann looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had foolishly raved; and the twilight was dying out rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only I {{want you}} to know, Ughtred," [...] she said, [...] "that I will never become your wife {{if it is to}} lessen your hold upon your people here. I wish they could know it. Some of these poor wounded {{soldiers}} look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were their enemy. Why, it is terrible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you think}} I'm mad, do you?" [...] asked the girl, with a quizzical smile. [...] "Well, I'm {{not going to}} satisfy your curiosity, even to prove my sanity; and I'm not anxious to pose as your lost Lucy. So please pass the sugar {{and try to be}} sociable, instead of staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> scared you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see," [...] she said, {{and glanced}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> over her spectacles. Her next {{question}} was even less manageable. [...] "Was the young fellow a gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never!" [...] {{she almost}} shrieked, and he winked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it were the}} best joke in the world. [...] "Never, as long as houses have stairs!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My guide {{looked up}} benevolently <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he felt it}} his duty to quiet my fears, {{and said in a}} {{soothing}} tone, [...] "O, no, no, no!" ...|$|R
