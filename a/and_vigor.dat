5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth <b>and</b> <b>vigor.</b>|$|E

Previously thought to be saprophytic, the Calostomataceae were determined to be ectomycorrhizal with Fagaceae and Myrtaceae using isotopic and molecular analyses. Species from the genera Pisolithus and Scleroderma {{have been used in}} forestry as mycorrhizal inocula to help promote the growth <b>and</b> <b>vigor</b> of young seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The LaSalle Street {{canyon is}} home to other {{historic}} buildings including the Rookery Building, a National Historic Landmark {{considered to be the}} oldest standing high-rise. A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style. The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds, especially pigeons. The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area, and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago's tallest buildings. Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1853, the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings {{at the north end of}} the canyon. The current Chicago City Hall, built in a Classical Revival style, was designed to symbolize the strength, dignity, <b>and</b> <b>vigor</b> of the government. Completed in 2001, an award-winning green roof was incorporated into the structure. All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E

Eighteen of the poems were written in 1926 and the other twenty were written the following year.

The first piece, titled Clash in the Clouds, was released on July 30, 2013. It is a non-story arena-based combat mode where the player is faced with increasingly difficult waves of enemies on various maps based on in-game settings. The player earns in-game money {{that they can use}} at a central hub to buy new vigors, upgrade weapons and vigors, and unlock character models, concept art, kinetoscopes, and music. Various challenges in the form of blue ribbons are given to the player, such as by killing foes with specific weapon <b>and</b> <b>vigor</b> combinations.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{the charismatic}} {{politician}} John F. Kennedy was elected {{as the first}} and– thus far– only Roman Catholic President of the United States. The Kennedy family brought a new life <b>and</b> <b>vigor</b> to {{the atmosphere of the}} White House. His time in office was marked by such notable events as the acceleration of the United States' role in the Space Race, escalation of the American role in the Vietnam War, the Cuban missile crisis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the jailing of Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Birmingham campaign, and the appointment of his brother Robert F. Kennedy to his Cabinet as Attorney General. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963, leaving the nation in profound shock.|$|E
25|$|Tunisian nationalists would {{complain}} that these improvements, e.g., {{the rail and}} mining operations, were intended to benefit primarily France; the French profited most, and the employment opportunities were open more to French colons than to Tunisians. French companies provided their own engineers, technicians, managers, and accountants, {{and most of the}} skilled work force. Another major grievance of nationalist critics regarded the 'flood' of cheap manufactured goods entering the Tunisian market. This competition worked havoc with the large artisan class, until then in good health <b>and</b> <b>vigor,</b> who made comparable goods by hand according to tradition. Here, the French did no more than passively introduce into Tunisia the fruits of advanced production techniques, and then let neutral market forces wreck their destruction on the local merchants, who could not compete on price.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai {{cultivation}} {{and care}} involves the long-term cultivation of small trees in containers, called bonsai in the Japanese tradition of this art form. Similar practices exist in other Japanese art forms {{and in other}} cultures, including saikei (Japanese), penjing (Chinese), and hòn non bộ (Vietnamese). Trees are difficult to cultivate in containers, which restrict root growth, nutrition uptake, and resources for transpiration (primarily soil moisture). In addition to the root constraints of containers, bonsai trunks, branches, and foliage are extensively shaped and manipulated to meet aesthetic goals. Specialized tools and techniques are used to protect the health <b>and</b> <b>vigor</b> of the subject tree. Over time, the artistic manipulation of small trees in containers {{has led to a}} number of cultivation and care approaches that successfully meet the practical and the artistic requirements of bonsai and similar traditions.|$|E

25|$|The new empire was characterised {{by a great}} enthusiasm <b>and</b> <b>vigor.</b> There was a rash {{of heroic}} artwork in {{imitation}} of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while {{it had always been}} rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that everyone wanted to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.|$|E

50|$|Having {{engineered}} {{an inquiry}} in 1835 into {{the running of}} the British Museum, Hawes put the case for scientists having a voice among its trustees, a line supported by witnesses Robert Edmond Grant <b>and</b> Nicholas <b>Vigors.</b> Opposition came from Robert Harry Inglis. The zoologists Grant <b>and</b> <b>Vigors</b> were concerned that the Museum should become a research institution, with systematic across the field of natural history, and should implement current views on taxonomy; they had support from James Scott Bowerbank, but they were resisted successfully by Philip Grey Egerton and John George Children, who backed the more conservative views of Richard Owen. There were other issues, such as public access, and Edward Edwards addressed proposals about that to Hawes in 1836.|$|R
40|$|Seed {{procyanidin}} {{composition of}} Vitis vinifera L. var. ˈCarignanˈ and ˈGrenacheˈ was analyzed {{to assess the}} impact of vintage climatology, plant <b>vigor</b> <b>and</b> bunch variability on the quality of grapes.

Procyanidin composition of seeds from four vineyards was analyzed by rapid resolution liquid chromatography (RRLC-DAD-TOF/MS). Vintage, <b>vigor</b> <b>and</b> ripeness uniformity had an influence on the procyanidin concentration in seeds.

500|$|Despite {{the film}} {{work and the}} higher fees he earned from it, Barrymore {{continued}} to seek stage work, and in January 1914 he played the lead in The Yellow Ticket at New York's Eltinge Theatre.
