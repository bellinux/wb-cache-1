This blancmange styled dish became so popular outside Wales that it got a new name, flummery, as the English couldn't {{pronounce}} the original. A similar dish, sucan, was made with less finely ground oatmeal, making a coarser product.|$|E
5|$|Months earlier, before Ellie meets Joel, Ellie's friend Riley (Yaani King) surprises Ellie {{at their}} {{boarding}} school after weeks away. She reveals {{that she has}} joined the Fireflies, a revolutionary militia group, and takes Ellie to explore an abandoned shopping mall. Riley reveals {{that she has been}} assigned to a group of Fireflies in a different city, and broke the rules to see Ellie again. The girls argue, but Ellie eventually tells her that she supports her decision as it is something that Riley has wanted for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Before</b> parting, Riley plugs Ellie's walkman into the sound system and dances with her. Ellie tearfully begs Riley not to leave. Riley rips her dog tags off and Ellie kisses her. Drawn by the noise, the Infected pursue Ellie and Riley; they run, but are bitten. They consider suicide, but choose to spend their final hours together.|$|E

5|$|The first {{operations}} in 1940 concerned Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain by the Wehrmacht. The unit was to receive 30 PR Supermarine Spitfire aircraft, specialised and adapted for reconnaissance use. They would {{be capable of}} 1,750 miles round trips. However, just 13 aircraft were available to the unit, and their range limited to 1,300 miles. Eventually, an assortment of Vickers Wellington and Spitfire flights were established. In August 1940, the first PR Spitfires arrived, but teething problems ensured that it would be <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> standardisation was achieved with equipment. In August, Coastal Command flew 193 sorties over the suspected invasion ports in the Netherlands, Belgium and France.|$|E

25|$|These are the {{earliest}} multicellular organisms in Earth’s history, {{despite the fact}} that unicellularity had been around for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> that. The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms. They are highly related to sponges (Porifera), which are the simplest multicellular organisms.|$|E

In a different manner, the Chlamydomonas regulatory protein is more complex: It is larger, crosses the thylakoid membrane twice rather than once, contains more protein-protein interactions sites, and even undergoes alternative splicing. It appears that the regulatory system underwent simplification during evolution.|$|E

25|$|Although synagogues existed <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> the {{destruction}} of the Second Temple in 70 CE, communal worship in the time while the Temple still stood centered around the korbanot ("sacrificial offerings") brought by the kohanim ("priests") in the Holy Temple. The all-day Yom Kippur service, in fact, was an event in which the congregation both observed the movements of the kohen gadol ("the high priest") as he offered the day's sacrifices and prayed for his success.|$|E

Robin finally admits that she needs more help and leaves home to get treatment at an inpatient facility.|$|E
25|$|While {{chemical}} kinetics {{is concerned}} with the rate of a chemical reaction, thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of detailed balance) and the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. This is demonstrated by, for example, the HaberBosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical clock reactions such as the BelousovZhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>before</b> finally attaining the equilibrium.|$|E
