6000|$|It was {{not very}} reverent to his cloth, or his recent tragical mood, but Glendenning was not offended; he laughed with a sheepish pleasure, and that evening he came with Miss Bentley to call upon us. The visit passed without unusual confidences until they rose to go, when she said {{abruptly}} to me: [...] "I feel that we both owe you a great deal, Mr. March. Arthur has been telling me of your talk this afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you said was all so wise and true! I don't mean," [...] she added, [...] "your suggestion about {{putting an end to}} the anomaly!" [...] and she and Glendenning both laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} it, Mary; it {{certainly}} looks like it. We {{are on the}} right trail, my girl, I am sure. That was a very heavy blow you struck her to-day, and she evidently felt it so. Two or three more such blows, and the victory will be won. I have no doubt now that Ruth Powlett somehow holds the key of this strange mystery in her hand, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you have said to her to-day {{will go a long way}} towards inducing her to unlock it. Forester was the murderer of Miss Carne, I have not a shadow of doubt, though how she knows it for certain is more than I can even guess." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You {{are only}} a sum of all of your {{influences}} and that's what we are[...] [...] I think that we're original <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we're doing is different and that's something I always knew we had on our side, {{but no matter how}} original you are you're still just a sum of your influences." ...|$|E
2500|$|That's all gonna be deconstructed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that's {{why this}} {{regulatory}} thing is so important." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy}} to wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what her shows always have is a real sense of optimism <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what we all need today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> came through in the bright patterns <b>and</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> something that she does so well.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a speech}} given {{at a dinner}} held in honour of the {{government}} leaders, Prince Charles spoke in what the Daily Telegraph described as [...] "a pitch for himself as the Queen's eventual successor {{as head of the}} organisation." [...] He spoke of his personal attachment to the Commonwealth: [...] "I feel very much part of the family. It's in my blood, I'm afraid. I have been brought up in the family <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we are renewing here are those family ties, those family associations and family values. I feel proud and enormously privileged {{to be part of it}} all." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song also {{references}} Van Morrison's 1964 {{love song}} [...] "Gloria." [...] Bono is {{quoted in the}} 1994 book Race of Angels: [...] "I actually really like that lyric. It was written really quickly. I think it expresses the thing of language again, this thing of speaking in tongues, {{looking for a way}} out of language. 'I try to sing this song... I try to stand up but I can't find my feet.' And taking this Latin thing, this hymn thing. It's so outrageous at the end going to the full Latin whack. That still makes me smile. It's so wonderfully mad and epic and operatic. And of course Gloria is about a woman in the Van Morrison sense. Being an Irish band, you're conscious of that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened at that moment was very interesting: people saw that you could actually write about a woman in the spiritual sense and that you could write about God in the sexual sense. And that was a moment. Because before {{that there had been a}} line. That you can actually sing to God, but it might be a woman? Now, you can pretend it's about God, but not a woman!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Pow has {{commented that}} his {{favourite}} scenes as Linden are those revolving around Olivia and Holly. Asked whether he felt Linden could ever {{fall in love}} again, Pow commented: [...] "I think Linden has the potential, very much, to love again. I think Linden was a wonderful husband and father. I'm sure that Olivia, Linden and Holly laughed together all the time. I think that their life was one of love, joy and family. I think {{that is why it}} is so hard for him to carry what he has lost every single day. I think there are things with Holly he needs to resolve before he can move on from Olivia. But I think he has feelings for someone that have awoken something inside him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happens in the future with Linden, and in his love life, will show the viewers more facets of his personality, but I also think it will show you that Linden deserves to fall in love again. There is a good human being with a big heart wasting away on his own. I think he could make someone's life really special and I hope that one day he gets the chance to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I know he {{was very}} sick about his brother looking too closely into his concerns. He has a little affair on just now {{that he wants to}} keep to himself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> that is the reason he went off so quietly." ...|$|R

2500|$|You can't {{categorize}} him. He's one {{of those}} singers that's not in one track. And yet <b>and</b> still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his records had more excitement and life into it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was his big selling point, {{that he was so}} full of energy.
