40|$|The article {{investigates the}} concept of {{agricultural}} <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> according to Art. 553 of the Civil Code. In particular, the author poses the question to what extent this concept corresponds {{with the requirements of}} modern agriculture. Three issues have been analysed in detail: the legal structure of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> the basis of unity of components arranged into <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> and the legal qualification and functions of particular material components of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate.</b> The author concludes that the legislator does not treat <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> as <b>a</b> unit of ownership only, but approaches this issue from the objective angle. For the time being, such an approach may be considered sufficient. However, in the future there may appear the neeed {{to pay more attention to}} functional aspects of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate,</b> and thus the reference to the economic category of <b>an</b> agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> may prove necessary. At present, {{the concept of}} an agricultural productive unit assumes the presence of agricultural land. This is why the Civil Code provisions on agricultural <b>real</b> <b>estates</b> are not applicable to agricultural productive units that do not have such land. The author postulates to amend the Code provisions adequately. Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|R
