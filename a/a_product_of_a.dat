5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy and insecurity. As <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E

25|$|The {{group of}} {{constructible}} angles is closed under the operation that halves angles (which corresponds to taking square {{roots in the}} complex numbers).

In 2014 the entire project was sold to the Russian government for a nominal sum, thus signalling the abandonment of the idea. No actual vehicles other than a few concept cars were ever produced.|$|E
25|$|This {{conflict}} of authority {{resulted in a}} local power struggle in Upper Peru between 1808 and 1810 and constituted {{the first phase of}} the efforts to achieve independence. In 1808 the president of the audiencia, Ramón García León de Pizarro, demanded affiliation with the Junta Central. The conservative judges of the audiencia were influenced, however, by their autocratic royalist philosophy and refused to recognize the authority of the junta because they saw it as <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rebellion. On May 25, 1809, tensions grew when the radical criollos, refusing to recognize the junta because they wanted independence, took to the streets. This revolt, one of the first in Latin America, was soon put down by the authorities.|$|E

25|$|Criticism {{includes}} {{that it may}} {{be better}} to look at the contributing personality factors rather than treat psychopathy as a unitary concept due to poor testability. Empirical evidence regarding the suggested reproductive success is lacking. Furthermore, if psychopathy is caused by the combined effects of {{a very large number of}} adverse mutations then each mutation may have such a small effect that it escapes natural selection. The personality is thought to be influenced by a very large number of genes and may be disrupted by random mutations, and psychopathy may instead be <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high mutation load. Psychopathy has alternatively been suggested to be a spandrel, a byproduct, or side-effect, of the evolution of adaptive traits rather than an adaptation in itself.|$|E
25|$|The Dead Sea scrolls {{are first}} century or older {{writings}} {{that show the}} language and customs of some Jews of Jesus' time. Scholars such as Henry Chadwick see the similar uses of languages and viewpoints recorded in the New Testament and the Dead Sea scrolls as valuable in showing that the New Testament portrays the first century period that it reports and is not <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> later period. However, {{the relationship between the}} Dead Sea scrolls and the historicity of Jesus {{has been the subject of}} highly controversial theories, and although new theories continue to appear, there is no overall scholarly agreement about their impact on the historicity of Jesus, despite the usefulness of the scrolls in shedding light on first-century Jewish traditions.|$|E
25|$|Some {{supporters}} of PMS {{as a social}} construct believe PMDD and PMS to be unrelated issues: according to them, PMDD {{is a product of}} brain chemistry, and PMS is <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hypochondriatic culture. Most studies on PMS and PMDD rely solely on self-reporting. According to sociologist Carol Tavris, Western women are socially conditioned to expect PMS or to at least know of its existence, and they therefore report their symptoms accordingly. The anthropologist Emily Martin argues that PMS is a cultural phenomenon that continues to grow in a positive feedback loop, and thus is a social construction that contributes to learned helplessness or convenient excuse. Tavris says that PMS is blamed as an explanation for rage or sadness. The decision to call PMDD an illness has been criticized as inappropriate medicalization. In both cases, they are referring to the emotional aspects, not the normal physical symptoms that are subjectively present.|$|E

25|$|The case of soil {{management}} in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) {{is a classic example}} of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or Terra preta, are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils. Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of charcoal in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity. It is now accepted that these soils are <b>a</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> labor-intensive technique termed slash-and-char. In contrast to the commonly known slash-and-burn technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell this dark earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.|$|E
