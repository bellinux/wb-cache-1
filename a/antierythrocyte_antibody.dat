40|$|Strong {{enhancement}} of the pathogenicity of an antierythrocyte monoclonal antibody was observed after infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus. While injection of the <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> alone induced only moderate anemia, concomitant infection with this virus, which is harmless in most normal mice, {{led to a}} dramatic drop in the hematocrit and to death of infected animals. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed {{a dramatic increase in}} the ability of macrophages from infected mice to phagocytose antibody-coated erythrocytes. These results indicate that viruses can trigger the onset of autoimmune disease by enhancing the pathogenicity of autoantibodies. They may explain how unrelated viruses could be implicated in the etiology of autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases...|$|E
40|$|During immune {{hemolysis}} {{by human}} complement, C' 3 (β 1 C-globulin) becomes physically {{attached to the}} erythrocyte membrane. Binding of C' 3 {{was found to be}} mediated by cell-bound, activated C' 2 and to have the characteristics of an enzymatic reaction. A single C' 4, 2 a site on the cell surface effected the binding of several hundred molecules of C' 3 if the latter was provided in excess. The accumulation of hemolytically inactive, physicochemically altered C' 3 in the fluid phase was found to be an inherent feature of the process of C' 3 binding. It is postulated that C' 4, 2 a activates C' 3 for its subsequent reaction with cell membrane receptors. <b>Antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> did not play an essential role in C' 3 uptake; C' 3 could be bound to erythrocyte-C' 4, 2 a complexes which were entirely devoid of antibody. Cell-bound C' 3 proved hemolytically active, the degree of hemolysis being proportional to the number of C' 3 molecules per cell.

Purified anti-E was applied in a concentration range resulting in the binding of 10 - 2, 600, 000 molecules/cell. Sheep serum antirabbit im-munoglobulin and peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex were used in excess. With a new light-scattering assay for peroxidase the sensitivity of measurement of enzyme activity on suspensions of cell stromata exceeded that of radioactivity assay allowing measurement of as little as 5 x 10 - ‘ mmole antibody/ml.

It is shown that the ability to produce <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> is affected by many factors, principal of whom it is difficult to identify. For the allosensibilisation development requires genetically determined differences in erythrocyte antigens phenotypes of donor and recipient, mother and fetus, which can lead to immune response and antibodies production. The biochemical nature of erythrocyte antigens, antigen dose (the amount of transfused doses, the number of antigens determinants on donor and fetus erythrocytes, the number of pregnancies) are important. Individual patient characteristics: age, gender, diseases, the use of immunosuppressive therapy and the presence of inflammatory processes, are also relevant. Note that antibody to one erythrocyte antigens have clinical value, and to the other – have no.

40|$|The Fas (CD 95) gene {{is among}} {{critical}} genetic factors in some autoimmune diseases, which {{are characterized by}} autoantibody (autoAb) productions. In mice, mutations in the Fas gene cause lymphoproliferation (lpr) which predominantly develops glomerulonephritis, whereas the mutations in human cause autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) characterized by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and thrombocytopenia. Although the mechanism of antinuclear Ab in Fas-deficient background has been well characterized, that of antierythrocyte Ab production in ALPS has been still unclear. To investigate this mechanism, we developed a mouse line by crossing the <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> transgenic mice (H+L 6 mice) and Fas-deficient mice. Although Fas deficiency did not break tolerance of autoreactive B- 2 cells in H+L 6 mice, autoreactive B- 1 cells in Fas-deficient H+L 6 homozygous mice became activated and differentiated into autoAb-producing cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and lamina propria of intestine, resulting in severe anemia. In addition, serum levels of interleukin (IL) - 10 significantly increased in Fas−/− × H+L 6 homozygous mice and administration of anti–IL- 10 Ab prevented exacerbation of autoAb production and AIHA. These results suggest that activation of B- 1 cells is responsible for induction of AIHA in Fas-deficient condition and that IL- 10 plays {{a critical role in}} terminal differentiation of B- 1 cells in these mice...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{characteristics}} of an immune response is the specificity of antigen recognition. This specificity is manifest {{in the activities of}} both thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) I and bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) and in the antibody produced by the B cells (1 - 11). We have studied the specificity of the T cells that mediate the helper function in the response of mice to heterologous erythrocyte antigens and have observed that these cells display a less restricted specificity than the <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> produced by B cells (12). Similar observations have recently been reported by others working with eryt]rrocyte (13 - 15) and protein ~ (16 [...] 18) antigens; however, Rajewsky et al., using heterologous serum albumin antigens, (19, 20) failed to see any qualitative differences between the specificities of helper T cells and of humoral antibody. A shortcoming in several of the relevant studies is that T cells were not established as limiting in the assay for their activity and that therefore exaggerated cross-reactivities with other antigens might have been measured. In the present study we measure T cell helper activity in the in vitro response of mouse spleen cells to the hapten trinitrophenol (TNP), coupled to an erythrocyte carrier, using a titration technique that assures that T cell activity is the limiting component in the system. We confirm our previous observation of the less restricted specificity of T cells compared with antibody and discuss the implica...|$|E

However, {{little is known about}} the process of B- 1 cell migration and differentiation in vivo. We developed a mouse line by crossing the <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> Tg mice (HL mice) with TCR-�/ � Tg mice specific for a selfthymus leukemia (TL) antigen in the recombination activating gene (RAG) 2 �/ � background. In the presence of the self-antigen, Tg �/ � T cells increased in number and manifested activated phenotypes. Peritoneal B- 1 cells in these mice migrated into mesenteric lymph nodes and differentiated into autoantibody-secreting cells, resulting in strong autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Furthermore, transfer of RAG 2 �/ � � HL bone marrow or peritoneal cells into the peritoneal cavity of RAG 2 �/ � � TCR-�/ � Tg mice gave rise to donor-derived B- 1 cells in mesenteric lymph nodes, and these cells produced the autoantibody. Thus, this study demonstrates that the migration of B- 1 cells and differentiation into the antibody-secreting cells can be induced by noncognate T cell help and implies the possibility that �/ � T cells may induce B- 1 cell differentiation in vivo.

Due to complement inhibitor expression on erythrocytes, {{the development of}} an alternative method to measure complement function in sheep serum was required. Method of study Several species of target erythrocyte and sensitizing antibody were investigated for improved measurement of complement function testing. Results and conclusion Guinea pig erythrocytes were identified as the optimal target, although sensitizing them with rabbit antiguinea pig erythrocyte antibody did not enhance the lysis by maternal sheep serum. In contrast, preterm neonatal sheep serum was unable to efficiently lyse guinea pig erythrocytes unless pre-sensitized with antibody. Further investigation revealed that maternal serum contained high levels of antibodies that cross-reacted with guinea pig and rabbit erythrocytes, while no cross-reacting <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found in preterm neonatal serum. Therefore, unlike primates, rabbits, and guinea pigs, no transplacental transfer of maternal IgG to foetal sheep occurs. Use of exogenous complement regulators is often used to dissect the contribution of complement to disease pathogenesis; however, we found that while full-length soluble human complement receptor 1 (sCR 1, CDX- 1135) was able to inhibit lysis of guinea pig erythrocytes by human and rat serum, no inhibition of sheep serum could be observed. Investigation of complement contribution to disease pathogenesis in the future will require the identification of an inhibitor that is effective against sheep complement...|$|R

In the passaged cells {{the proportion of}} C receptor lymphocytes was strongly reduced, in parallel with the capacity to lyse chicken erythrocytes (Ec) {{in the presence of}} IgG-rabbit anti-Ec antibody. In other experiments, lymphocytes forming rosettes with Es bearing activated rabbit complement [C(ra) ] from C 6 -deficient rabbits were removed by centrifugation through human serum albumin-gelatine mixtures. This procedure also depleted the lymphocyte preparations of antibody-dependent cytolytic effector cells. The results suggest that rations of antibody-dependent cytolytic effector cells. The result suggest that such effector cells have receptors for human C as well as for C(ra). Lymphocytes were not able to lyse erythrocytes bearing either human C 3 b (similar to 30, 000 molecules/Ec) or activated C(ra) in the absence if IgG <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Under the same experimental conditions these target cells were efficiently lysed in the presence of small amounts of IgG antitarget cell antibodies. This suggests that the interaction between the cellular Fcreceptors and the Fc part of the inducing antibodies is of special significance for the triggering of the cell-mediated lytic reaction. However, although target cell-bound C did not trigger cytolysis, it seemed to potentiate antibody-dependent cytolysis, probably by enhancing effector cell- target cell contacts...|$|R

40|$|Surface-expressed {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) {{has been}} shown to have a critical role in allelic exclusion of Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chains. Although various degrees of suppression of endogenous Ig expression are observed in Ig transgenic (Tg) mice, it was not clear whether this difference is due to different onsets of Tg expression or to different levels of Tg expression, which are obviously affected by integration sites of the transgene. In this study we generated <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibody</b> Tg mice that carry tandem joined H and L chain transgenes (H+L) and confirmed that homozygosity of the transgene loci enhances the level of transgene expression as compared with heterozygosity. Suppression of endogenous H and L chain gene expression was stronger in homozygous than in heterozygous Tg mice. Similar results were obtained in control Tg mice carrying the H chain only. These results suggest that there is a threshold of the B cell receptor expression level that induces allelic exclusion. In addition, despite the same B cell receptor specificity, the size of Tg autoreactive B- 1 cell compartment in the peritoneal cavity is larger in homozygous than in heterozygous mice, although the number of the Tg B- 2 cell subset decreased in the spleen and bone marrow of homozygous Tg mice as compared with heterozygous Tg mice. By contrast, homozygosity of the H chain alone Tg line, which does not recognize self-antigens, did not increase the size of the peritoneal B- 1 subset. These results suggest that the size of the B- 1 cell subset in the Tg mice may depend on strength of signals through B cell receptors triggered by self-antigens...|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} skewing in {{the repertoire}} of VH, D, and JH gene segments strongly {{indicates that the}} leukemic Igs in CLL patients with AIHA have been selected because of particular antigen specificities that could promote {{the development of the}} hemolytic anemia. This could occur either by a direct involvement of the CLL Ig in erythrocyte destruction or, indirectly, by inducing the production of pathogenic <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The first possibility was supported by our recent finding that in most CLL cases a small subset of leukemic cells undergoes Ig isotype-switching. 9 The isotypeswitched CLL cells were found to produce both membrane and secretory -chain transcripts, of which the latter could encode part of the IgG antibodies that have been implicated in RBC destruction. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the reactivity of the Igs expressed by the leukemic cells from the CLL-AIHA patients HA- 2 and HA- 5. These two Igs contained strikingly similar heavy-chain CDR 3 regions that were associated with the 51 p 1 VH gene segment; both of them used λ light chains that belonged to different Vλ gene families (HA- 2 VL is 95. 5 % homologous to Humlv 122 from the VλI family, and HA- 5 VL is 93 % homologous to Humlv 318 from the VλIII family). The VH and VL region genes from these two Igs were expressed in eukaryotic cell lines as dimeric single-chain (sc) Fv fragments, and their reactivities were tested against erythrocytes and a panel of self and foreign antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the affinity-purified scFv fragments showed the absence of any significant RBC binding. On the other hand, both antibody fragments showed similar low-affinity binding to human IgG (FIGURE 1 B) and various reactivities against other antigens such as phosphorylcholine, dextran, lipopolysaccharide, and single-stranded DNA. These data indicate that the 51 pl-encoded CLL Igs are not directly involved in RBC destruction, but could promote the development of AIHA by inducing a disturbance in the idiotypic network that would ultimately lead to the expansion of autoreactive B cell clones with antierythrocyte specificity. Alternatively, secreted isotype-switched CLL Igs could bind to anti-RBC antibodies and could promote the adherence of sensitized red blood cells to the Fc receptors on macrophages...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive {{interactions}} with stromal cells and the extracellular matrix {{are essential for}} the differentiation and migration of hematopoietic progenitors. In the erythrocytic lineage, a number of adhesion molecules are expressed in the developing erythrocytes and are thought {{to play a role}} in the homing and maturation of erythrocytic progenitors. However, many of these molecules are lost during the final developmental stages leading to mature erythrocytes. One of the adhesion molecules that remains expressed in mature, circulating erythrocytes is CD 147. This study shows that blockade of this molecule on the cell surface by treatment with F(ab') (2) fragments of anti-CD 147 monoclonal antibody disrupts the circulation of erythrocytes, leading to their selective trapping in the spleen. Consequently, mice develop an anemia, and de novo, erythropoietin-mediated erythropoiesis in the spleen. In contrast, these changes were not seen in mice similarly treated with another <b>antierythrocyte</b> monoclonal <b>antibody</b> with a different specificity. These results suggest that the CD 147 expressed on erythrocytes likely plays a critical role in the recirculation of mature erythrocytes from the spleen into the general circulation.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of blood flow and new blood systems was {{connected with the}} development of the immunohematology methods. The blood flow was discovered in the 17 th century. This meant great scientific development for haematology. The first blood transfusion was carried out in 1665. The transfusion of animal blood was unsuccessful and cast doubt on this method. As a result of this,the interest in this method decreased. Blundell emphasizedthe importance of human blood transfusion. The main reason for failure of first transfusions was the ignorance of blood types(blood groups). The blood types were discovered in the 20 th century. The blood groups became well known thanks to Landsteiner and also to Jánský. The first discovered blood system is AB 0. It is the most important blood system which was described by Landsteiner in 1900. The most polymorphous system which has got the biggest aloimmunogenicity is the Rh blood group system. The first records of the Rh blood group system date back to 1939. The {{discovery of}} blood group systems had a great impact on further development of lab methods for identification of the antigens of these systems. It also contributed to the development of methods which we use to prove the presence of the erythrocytes antibodies. Agglutinin method is the most suitable method for identification of antibodies against erythrocytes. Erythrocytes which are sensitized by antibody create agglutination which can be observed under a microscope. Pregnant women produce antibodies against antigens on the erythrocytes of embryos leak of erythrocytes into their blood flow. Testing of <b>antierythrocyte</b> <b>antibodies</b> should lead to early diagnoses of possible development of haemolytic disease of the newborns;to monitoring of embryo with the use of other method than immunohaematological method;to determination of the suitable therapy of the haemolyticdisease of the newborn. The haemolytic disease of the newborn is a disease,for which shortened survival of the embryo's and the newborn'serythrocytes is characteristic. In 1939 Levin a Stetson proved that woman can be immunised during her pregnancy against blood group antigens which occur on baby'serythrocytes but aren't present at the mother's side. Mother's antibodies are tied to specific antigens of the fetal and newborn erythrocytes,which later haemolyse. The disease can have different course. It causes serious fetal and newborn morbidity and mortality. Especially the antibodies anti-D,-c,-E,-K can cause serious haemolytic disease of the newborn and requirecareful monitoring. Only IgG with low molecular weight penetrate through placenta(until the 24 th week of pregnancy very slowly). The introduction of anti-D Ig(given prophylactically) became a very common and successful method for prevention of haemolytic disease of the newborn. The theme of this thesis is the examination and monitoring of potentially risk group of pregnant women,whose embryo is threatened by possible haemolytic disease of the newborn,with the use of suitable immunohaematological method. Titre testing is generally accessible indicative testing,which is used to monitor pregnant women with clinically significant level of antibodies. The level of antibodies in a blood sample measured using the antibody titre test is repeatedly monitored during the whole pregnancy and the results from every two successive measurements are compared. Between Jan 2011 -Jul 2013 5622 pregnant women were tested in prenatal laboratory in the Blood Bank Department of Hospital České Budějovice. 281 pregnant women were aloimmunized during their pregnancy and antibodies against antigens on erythrocytes of their embryos were found in their blood.

This autoantibody in NZB mice was detectable by the cytotoxicity test at both 4 °C and 37 °C; the prevalence and antibody titre were generally higher at 4 °C. Mice of other strains also produced natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody although in lower prevalence and antibody titre {{and in some instances}} the activity was greater at 37 °C than at 4 °C. Natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody in NZB mice reacted equally with the thymocytes of virtually all strains of mice tested but to a lesser degree with the thymocytes of SJL/J mice. A serum pool obtained from old NZB mice had an extremely high titre of natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody (1 : 1024 at 4 °C). Nevertheless, the cells in lymph nodes, spleen and blood leucocytes were only partially sensitive to this serum pool, and bone marrow cells were for the most part negative. By absorption, the antigen reacting with natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody was found in thymus, lymph node, spleen and brain of adult mice, thymus of newborn mice and some leukaemias.
