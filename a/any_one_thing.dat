Lola taunts him back, enlisting {{the help of the}} female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman's ideal man than Don ("What a Woman Wants"). Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better [...] "man": Lola will do <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that Don specifies if Don will do one thing that Lola specifies. Don's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub. Charlie, remembering Lola's background, is horrified. Lola easily scores against Don in the ring but ultimately lets Don win the match ("In This Corner"). Afterwards, in private, Don asks why she let him win, and Lola replies that she could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates. She gives him her part of the challenge: [...] "accept someone for who they are." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{nature has}} made <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> less {{susceptible}} than all others of exclusive property, {{it is the}} action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think it}} {{has done more to}} emancipate woman than <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of {{self-reliance}} and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood." [...] In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union, wrote A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way, a 75-page illustrated memoir praising [...] "Gladys", her bicycle, for its [...] "gladdening effect" [...] on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.|$|E

"As {{money is}} not {{exchanged}} for <b>any</b> <b>one</b> specific quality, for <b>any</b> <b>one</b> specific <b>thing,</b> or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, {{from the standpoint of}} its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every quality for every other, even contradictory, quality and object: it is the fraternisation of impossibilities.

50|$|I am {{not entirely}} {{comfortable}} with labeling this an anti-Mormon work, for I don't see {{hatred of the}} Church and a determination to destroy as the prime motive behind it.

60|$|Let me beseech my hon. {{friends at}} least to try for some sense of {{balanced}} proportion, instead of allowing their wrath at one particular incident of policy to blot out from their vision all the wide and durable operations, to which we have set firm and persistent hands.

60|$|This wrong {{connexion}} in {{our minds}} of ideas in themselves loose and independent of one another, has such an influence, and is of so great force to set us awry in our actions, as well moral as natural, passions, reasonings, and notions themselves, that perhaps there is not <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that deserves more to be looked after.|$|E

60|$|It wouldn't {{have been}} so bad--this Mrs. Rasselyer-Brown herself admitted--if Mr. Rasselyer-Brown did anything. This phrase should be clearly understood.

Thus, there was Mr. Lucullus Fyshe, who made soda-water, {{but at the same}} time everybody knew that he had the best collection of broken Italian furniture on the continent; there wasn't a sound piece among the lot.|$|E

5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} <b>any</b> other <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> succeeded in laying {{a foundation for}} Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who {{was brought up in}} the early Yale football school.

Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.|$|R

Whatsoever is perfect in its kind, in literature, is imperishable: nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect, it must and will stand alone: its immortality is secure.|$|R
