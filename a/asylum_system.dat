5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} humanise the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the <b>asylum</b> <b>system,</b> as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E

25|$|Svalbard {{is part of}} Norway and has {{a special}} status under {{international}} law. It {{is not part of}} the Schengen Area. There is no visa regime in existence for Svalbard either for entry, residence or work, but it is difficult to visit Svalbard without travelling through the Schengen Area, although there are charter flights from Russia. Since 2011, the Norwegian government has imposed systematic border checks on individuals wishing to enter and leave Svalbard, requiring a passport or national identity card for non-Norwegian citizens. As a result, the border between Svalbard and the rest of Norway is largely treated like any other external Schengen border. A Schengen visa must be multiple entry to allow returning to Norway. There is no welfare or <b>asylum</b> <b>system</b> for immigrants on Svalbard, and people incapable of supporting themselves may be sent away.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the Western <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> have had {{to adapt to a}} new {{situation}} in the international refugee protection regime, where persecution based on sexual orientation and gender identity has become a legitimate asylum claim. Nevertheless, the Western <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> struggle to accommodate to the diversity among the asylum seekers, and the case procedures of these cases are characterized by lack of knowledge of diversity among ways of being LGBTI, as well as issues connected to Western-bias in terms of culture and LGBTI identities. This thesis is a study of the challenges and issues that exist in relation to the case procedures of LGBTI asylum claims in the Western world, researched through case study interviews with LGBTI persons who have applied for asylum in Denmark. These issues are studied through a theoretical framework build with concepts from the theory of intersectionality, with its emphasis on the intersecting identity markers which create the life and opportunities of marginalized individuals, and postcolonialism, with its critical approach to structures with Western bias. The interviews point to a situation where LGBTI asylum seekers face great challenges in the processing of their asylum claims both in terms of accommodation and general well-being, {{and in terms of the}} way the Western asylum authorities handle LGBTI asylum cases, and the procedural approaches the asylum institutions have to these cases. The case procedures are approached with a generalized view on asylum seekers, and the case workers receive no specific training on how to handle asylum cases where the applicant is LGBTI, meaning that they often have to rely on their own Western-biased perceptions and stereotypical conceptions on how LGBTI persons should behave and look. This leads to a situation where LGBTI persons who are in need of - and entitled to - protection sometimes do not get it, because the <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> struggle to take the diversity of asylum seekers into account...|$|R
25|$|In 1870, the Malden Lunatic Asylum {{was closed}} and its {{patients}} relocated to the London Lunatic Asylum as the Malden branch had always been considered a temporary location within the Provincial Lunatic <b>Asylum</b> <b>system.</b> The Fort remained relatively abandoned until 1875, except for a caretaker on staff to oversee the landscape and building maintenance. However, it should be mentioned that {{the closing of the}} asylum was a great detriment to the economy of the town of Amherstburg. For almost sixteen years the asylum acted as a steady market for locally produced goods. Additionally, the asylum was the single largest employer in 1861 for the town. As a result, while Fort Malden would serve several different functions throughout its history, it would always remain of utmost importance to Amherstburg’s economy and development engendered by and originating from its military days.|$|E
25|$|CALS {{represents}} refugees seeking {{political asylum}} in the United States because of threatened persecution {{in their home}} countries. Students in CALS assume primary responsibility for the representation of these refugees, whose requests for asylum have already been rejected by the U.S. government. The Center for Applied Legal Studies was founded in the 1980s by Philip Schrag. Until 1995, the Clinic heard cases {{in the field of}} consumer protection. Under the direction of Schrag and Andrew Schoenholtz, the Clinic began specializing in asylum claims, for both detained and non-detained applicants. In conjunction with their work for the Clinic, Schrag and Schoenholtz have written books about America's political <b>asylum</b> <b>system,</b> with the help of Clinic fellows and graduate students. The duo's most recent book, Lives in the Balance was published in 2014 and provides an empirical analysis of how Homeland Security decided asylum cases over a recent fourteen-year period. The group's work in human rights law has met praise from international organizations like the United Nations Human Rights Council. Under the direction of Schrag and Schoenholtz, the clinic has also focused on more prolonged displacement situations for political refugees.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, human {{trafficking}} cases are processed {{by the same}} officials to simultaneously determine the refugee and trafficking victim statuses of a person. However, criteria for qualifying as a refugee and a trafficking victim differ and they have different needs for staying in a country. A person may need assistance as a trafficking victim but his/her circumstances may not necessarily meet the threshold for asylum. In which case, not being granted refugee status affects their status as a trafficked victim and thus their ability to receive help. Reviews of the statistics from the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), a tool created by the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (CoE Convention) to help states effectively identify and care for trafficking victims, found that positive decisions for non-European Union citizens were much {{lower than that of}} EU and UK citizens. According to data on the NRM decisions from April 2009 to April 2011, an average of 82.8% of UK and EU citizens were conclusively accepted as victims while an average of only 45.9% of non-EU citizens were granted the same status. High refusal rates of non-EU people point to possible stereotypes and biases about regions and countries of origin which may hinder anti-trafficking efforts, since the <b>asylum</b> <b>system</b> is linked to the trafficking victim protection system.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years all Western European {{countries}} have transformed their immigration and <b>asylum</b> <b>systems.</b> Most {{of them have}} implemented restrictive measures {{in response to the}} soaring numbers of asylum applications since the 1990 s. Germany and the United Kingdom were - and continue to be - among the most popular destinations for asylum seekers. This paper explores the development of asylum (and immigration) policies in both countries in the post-war era, and then attempts to answer the following question: why have the <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> in Germany and the UK become more restrictive after 1990 ? A model has been developed to explain the shift towards more restrictive asylum regimes, as driven by a number of actors, instead of the monocausal explanatory models in the literature. The soaring number of asylum claims was the primary reason for each of these actors {{to take part in the}} public discourse on the issue. Therefore, it is argued that the more restrictive policies occurred as a consequence of the interplay between political groups, the media, those actors in society that felt threatened by asylum seekers, and pro-asylum non-governmental organizations. Additionally, the international asylum legislation is considered to work in favor of asylum seekers and to set the borders for the asylum debate in both countries...|$|R
30|$|As for the {{international}} protection pillar, {{by looking at the}} matrix of initiatives in all of our study cases, we can only notice the weak support towards this dimension of migration management. In the case of Moldova, there has been so far very few initiatives (four in total led by two member states and ICMPD) aiming to “reinforce the capacities” of the national institutions in their ability to provide protection to asylum-seekers, that mostly took the form of discussions between experts. Through the entire region of the South Caucasus, only one project was directed towards international protection, and consisted in a quality analysis of the national <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> for all three countries. The lack of interest from the European Commission and the member states in {{the international}} protection pillar contradicts an argument often heard in the literature on the external dimension of EU’s migration policy. Strengthening the <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> in the neighbouring countries of the EU {{should be part of the}} Union’s strategy to “externalize” its policies of control and should be encouraged in order to reduce the number of individuals seeking asylum in the member states. However, this logic does not seem to be reflected in the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood, as shown by the weak support to projects related to the international protection pillar of the Mobility Partnerships.|$|R

500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British <b>asylum</b> <b>system</b> and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he is not a political writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best kind of political novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, Little Bee and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E

40|$|Humanitarian visas can {{be highly}} {{effective}} and useful tools to ensure access to asylum for select groups of asylum-seekers with a need for international protection. In {{the context of the}} current refugee protection crisis, humanitarian visas could complement and alleviate the pressure on ordinary asylum procedures on the territory of Member States in the EU. A system of humanitarian visas may be implemented on the basis of existing EU law and could be managed without the establishment of any new institutions.

2500|$|The First Medical Superintendent of the Malden Lunatic Asylum was Dr. Andrew Fisher. Under his tenure, {{several more}} {{buildings}} were constructed, {{such as a}} replacement laundry building in 1861 that would later {{be known as the}} Hough House. Later, in 1864, additions were added to the officer’s quarters and staff sergeant's guardhouse. Additionally, in 1860, Dr. Fisher was responsible for the asylum’s grounds being enclosed as two thousand yards of fenced-in outdoor space for patient recreation. This could be argued as reflecting Dr. Fisher's more progressive therapeutic methodology of patient treatment. For example, he had the asylum’s grounds continually landscaped, established an accessible library for patients, and offered weekly dances and religious services for patient enjoyment. In addition, Dr. Fisher did not place patients in solitary confinement nor prescribe many medications, as is reflected in the 1862 annual asylum report where only $95.13 was recorded to have been spent on narcotics. However, the asylum’s other practices do reflect the hegemonic attitudes towards mental illness during the nineteenth century. While the institution's medicinal expenses remained relatively low, this is likely {{due to the fact that}} alcohol was used instead in several treatments, as reflected in the same 1862 report, which cited that $1125.88 was spent on liquor. Additionally, Dr. Fisher employed his patients as labourers for the asylum, with men doing much of the physical building repairs and women performing housekeeping chores such as laundry. The average length of stay for patients at the Toronto- Malden-London <b>asylum</b> <b>system</b> was eighteen years in the 1860s with a discharge rate of 60% by 1869. During the Fort's time as the Malden Provincial Lunatic Asylum approximately 260 patients, mostly considered [...] "quiet chronics", were treated. It is interesting to note that most of the patients treated in 1861 are listed as having been born in Ireland out of the 219 patients registered that year.|$|E

40|$|Many {{asylum seekers}} {{entering}} the European Union (EU) cross {{more than one}} Member State border before lodging their asylum claims. In response, the EU adopted Dublin II to designate the point of first entry, rather than the point of application, as the State responsible for examining the claim. Unfortunately, this allocation of examination responsibilities overburdens States on the frontline of entry, such as Greece, and has exacerbated the systemic deficiencies in these states’ <b>asylum</b> <b>systems.</b> The Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in the Joined Cases C- 411 / 10 2 ̆ 6 C- 493 / 10 helped clarify that a receiving state cannot transfer asylum seekers to the responsible state {{if they would be}} subjected to inhumane treatment there. Although this decision halted Dublin II transfers to states where fundamental rights risked being violated, the EU continues to struggle with an unbalanced distribution of asylum claims. Until the principle of solidarity is put into practice and more claims are shifted to lesser-burdened states, the EU will not meet its goal of creating a fair and effective Common European Asylum Policy...|$|R

40|$|This book fills a {{significant}} lacuna {{in our understanding}} of the refugee crisis by analyzing the dynamics that lie behind fifteen years of asylum policies in the European Union. It sheds light on why cooperation has led to reinforced refugee protection on paper but has failed to provide it in practice. Offering innovative empirical, theoretical and methodological research on this crucial topic, it argues that the different <b>asylum</b> <b>systems</b> and priorities of the various Member States explain the EU's lack of initiative in responding to this humanitarian emergency. The author demonstrates that the strong regulators of North-Western Europe have used their powerful bargaining positions to shape EU asylum policies decisively, which has allowed them to impose their will on Member States in South-Eastern Europe. These latter countries, having barely made a mark on EU policies, are now facing significant difficulties in implementing them. The EU will only identify potential solutions to the crisis, the author concludes, when it takes these disparities into account and establishes a functioning common refugee policy. This novel work will appeal to students and scholars of politics, immigration and asylum in the EU...|$|R
40|$|The current {{humanitarian}} crisis is unprecedented with an appalling and unacceptable human cost. The number of refugees is unparalleled in recent times.

40|$|The 2006 United Nations report, the State of the World's Refugees, {{outlines}} many of {{the challenges}} of studying migration in the contemporary moment. The first of these being the recognition that migration today is increasingly 'mixed' or blended. In contrast, the postWorld War II state-based migration regimes seem to offer governmental categories that, to paraphrase Friedrich Nietzsche, grasp at the smoke of an evaporating reality. These days, student migration is also widdy recognized (even by governments) to be blended with labour migration. With increasing restrictions on labour migration, applications for asylum offer {{one of the few}} routes to a better life; and, with increasingly restrictive <b>asylum</b> <b>systems,</b> unknown numbers are falling into irregular routes. All of this must be situated against a background in which the numbers of migrants in the world continues to grow.
