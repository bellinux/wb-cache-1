25|$|If {{the male}} becomes alarmed {{enough to leave}} the nest, he will attempt a {{distraction}} display. This usually involves a fake injury display, {{similar to that of}} the killdeer. To do this, he will hop on one leg and attempt to fly, always falling down. He will perform this display if the eggs have not hatched or the chicks <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> young to fly. It is generally believed that tinamous are not as effective at distraction displays as other birds.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlich {{has argued}} that {{humanity}} has simply deferred the disaster {{by the use of}} more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the so-called Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> great for a sustainable future.|$|E
25|$|Along with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, also rated PG, Gremlins {{was one of}} {{two films}} in 1984 to {{influence}} the MPAA to create the PG-13 rating, with Red Dawn being the first film released in theaters that was given the new rating in August 1984. The scene in which a gremlin explodes in the microwave was particularly influential to the idea that some films too light to be rated R <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> mature to be rated PG. The change to the rating system was not insignificant; the rating PG-13 turned out to be appealing to many film patrons, as it implied some excitement without being too explicit.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the roof}} of the Froghall tunnel has always been {{extremely}} low, the 2003 restoration included lowering the water level in the pound after dredging, and thus the headroom in the tunnel was improved to 5ft (1.52m) with a beam of 6ft 8ins (2.03m). Unfortunately the new moorings just past the tunnel remain relatively little used, as many modern boats <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> high to pass through the tunnel. A height profile gauge is located at the exit of Flintmill Lock 17 to indicate if a boat has sufficient clearance to pass through the tunnel. The low height restriction would similarly affect proposals to reopen stretches of the Uttoxeter Canal to boating.|$|E
25|$|In warm, damp climates, H. aspersa may {{lay eggs}} {{as often as}} five times from February through October, {{depending}} on the weather and region. Mating and egg-laying begin when {{there are at least}} 10 hours of daylight and continue until days begin to get shorter. In the United States, longer hours of sunlight that occur when temperatures <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> cold will affect this schedule, but increasing hours of daylight still stimulate egg laying. If warm enough, the eggs hatch in about 2 weeks, or in 4 weeks if cooler. It takes the baby snails several more days {{to break out of the}} sealed nest and climb to the surface. In a climate similar to southern California's, H. aspersa matures in about 2 years. In central Italy, H. aspersa hatches and emerges from the soil almost exclusively in the autumn. If well fed and not overcrowded, those snails that hatch at the start of the season will reach adult size and form a lip at the edge of their shell by the following June. If the environment is manipulated to get more early hatchlings, the size and number of snails that mature the following year will increase. In South Africa, some H. aspersa mature in 10 months, and under ideal conditions in a laboratory, some have matured in 6 to 8 months. Most of H. aspersa's reproductive activity takes place in the second year of its life.|$|E

2500|$|Caramon, Raistlin, and Crysania {{create the}} {{so-called}} Fistandantilus Army from local populace under pretension of ravaging the dwarven kingdom Thorbadin {{in the far}} South, with Caramon being their leader. [...] Many come to join his army, and they number several hundred. [...] The army continues south. The hill dwarves join up with Caramon's army, believing that the mountain dwarves have stolen supplies and wealth from them. Crysania flees when Raistlin rejects her love and makes plans to bring word of the true gods to the people, 200 years before Goldmoon would during the War of the Lance. She encounters a place stricken by plague and finds a dying false cleric, who she tries to convert. She discovers that people <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>too</b> angry to accept the true gods yet.
