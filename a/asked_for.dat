5|$|In {{the court}} of Vizhnitz, it was known that if the Rebbe <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a {{cigarette}} to smoke {{in the middle of}} reading a kvitel, it was a sign that the petitioner's request had been accepted. Rabbi Eliezer Dovid Friedman, a follower of the fourth Vizhnitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Meir Hager, witnessed this in 1965 when he delivered a kvitel to the Rebbe on behalf of a Melbourne Jew stricken with cancer and the Rebbe <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a cigarette while reading the kvitel. The man recovered completely. However, in 1972, immediately after the death of the Rebbe, the Melbourne Jew fell ill with the same disease and succumbed to it.|$|E

When she switched rooms and found the replacement {{did not have the}} shower and bath she wanted, Polite <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a refund, which she received. Afterward, however, she <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> return of a $1 tip ($ in 2014) that she gave to an elevator operator. The operator refused; Polite began to protest loudly, which caught the attention of Collins. According to another account, she became drunk at a party in one of the rooms, and confronted the officer as she attempted to leave.|$|E

5|$|After Collins told Polite to leave, {{she became}} {{verbally}} abusive {{of the officer}} and Collins arrested her {{on the grounds of}} disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit the officer and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the shoulder with his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when the officer pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> its return, Collins shot him. Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy as he entered the hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm. The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that moral {{questions}} <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> answers {{in the way}} other questions do. In this article, moral and non-moral versions of the question ‘Should I do x or y?’ are compared. While non-moral questions of that form typically <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> answers of the form ‘You should do x/y’, so-called ‘narrow answers’, moral questions often do not <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> such narrow answers. Rather, they <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> answers recognizing their delicacy, {{the need for a}} deeper understanding of the meaning of the alternatives and the fact that moral decisions are, as Gaita formulates it, ‘non-accidentally and inescapably’ the agent’s to make. In short, moral questions often <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> a kind of answer that is highly different from the kind of answer non-moral questions <b>ask</b> <b>for.</b> In presupposing the ideal answer to a moral question to be a narrow answer, moral philosophers have tended to overlook this. status: publishe...|$|R
