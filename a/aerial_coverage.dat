40|$|Agro-silvo-pastoral {{systems were}} studied in central–eastern Sardinia (Italy) {{to assess their}} {{environmental}} impact in marginal Mediterranean areas. Land cover changes between 1955 and 1996 were assessed by using multitemporal <b>aerial</b> <b>coverages.</b> The shift from extensive to semi-extensive production systems resulted in a decrease in woodland and in a marked increase in artificial pastures. Related field surveys highlighted widespread land degradation processes in areas where pasture amendment actions on land characterised by steep or fairly dissected morphology had been carried out. Starting from a past land suitability classification developed at farm level, a scheme {{for the evaluation of}} the land suitability to the creation of new pastures at regional scale was developed by using GIS methodologies. The scheme classifies the land into five land suitability classes as defined in the FAO Framework for Land Evaluation (highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, currently not suitable, permanently unsuitable). The land suitability classification performed by the GIS model showed high accuracy if compared to the traditional procedure. The comparison between the land suitability and current land uses allows the identification of areas sensitive to land degradation where land resource conservation programmes can be proposed...|$|R

30|$|The 1990 Hines Creek {{landslide}} {{occurred on}} the opposite valley wall {{of a much larger}} landslide. This larger landslide predates the earliest provincial <b>aerial</b> photographic <b>coverage</b> of the site, in 1952. Lu et al. (1998) speculate that the pre- 1952 landslide was a major contributing factor to the occurrence of the 1990 landslide, as it directed the stream into the opposite valley wall, causing undercutting of the slope. They estimated the volume of the pre- 1952 landslide to be 48 Mm 3. An extensive sedimentary deposit formed upriver of the pre- 1952 landslide, which persisted until at least 1988 (Alberta air photo AS 3729 – 88).|$|R

Reurning home in late September 2006, the squadron immediately started preparing for the next OIF deployment.|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{photography}} {{has been}} acquired regularly for topographic mapping since {{the decade of}} 1930. In Portugal there are several archives of aerial photos in national mapping institutes, {{as well as in}} local authorities, containing a total of nearly one hundred thousand photographs, mainly from the 1940 s, 1950 s and some from 1930 s. These data sets provide important information about the evolution of the territory, for environment and agricultural studies, land planning, and many other examples. There is an interest in making these <b>aerial</b> <b>coverages</b> available in the form of orthorectified mosaics for integration in a GIS. The orthorectification of old photographs may pose several difficulties. Required data about the camera and lens system used, such as the focal distance, fiducial marks coordinates or distortion parameters may not be available, making it difficult to process these data in conventional photogrammetric software. This paper describes an essentially automatic methodology for orientation, orthorectification and mosaic composition of blocks of old aerial photographs, using Agisoft Photoscan structure from motion software. The operation sequence is similar to the processing of UAV imagery. The method was applied to photographs from 1947 and 1958, provided by the Portuguese Army Geographic Institute. The orientation was done with GCPs collected from recent orthophototos and topographic maps. This may be a difficult task, especially in urban areas that went through many changes. Residuals were in general below 1 meter. The agreement of the orthomosaics with recent orthophotos and GIS vector data was in general very good. The process is relatively fast and automatic, and can be considered in the processing of full <b>coverages</b> of old <b>aerial</b> photographs...|$|R
