The new funding model will combine Block Grant with new tax revenues from a Scottish Income Tax, a Scottish Land Transaction Tax and a Scottish Landfill Tax. However, it has been heavily criticised by the Scottish Government for having a "long-term deflationary bias". This is a strong attack on a model intended to maintain stability and promote accountability in devolution finance.

The UK Budget process provides a high degree of stability. It operates through incremental change, in which the major part of the new budget is the existing baseline, and decisions are made around the margins of this budget base. In the case of the Scottish Budget, incremental adjustments are made through the Barnett Formula which delivers the same per capita increase/decrease as comparable UK programmes, and has delivered "stability and predictability" since devolution...|$|R

40|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the euro, {{academics}} and policymakers were concerned that the loss of the monetary policy instrument would deprive participating countries of a vital tool to respond to country-specific economic shocks. This concern was rooted in the generally accepted proposition that market-based adjustment channels-i. e. labour mobility and capital flows-tended to be weaker among euro area countries than among regions of existing monetary unions such as the United States. Automatic stabilizers had long been regarded as playing a key role in macroeconomic stabilization. In particular, they were generally considered as having contributed significantly to the decrease of output volatility witnessed in Europe and in the United States after World War II, when the size of governments increased substantially {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.

40|$|To support {{helicopter}} pilots during {{slung load}} operations currently a pilot assistance system called Hubschrauber- Außenlast-Assistenzsystem (HALAS) {{is being developed}} within a cooperation of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and iMAR Navigation GmbH. The objective {{of this research is}} the demonstration of an <b>automatic</b> slung load <b>stabilisation</b> and positioning system during the flight test with DLR’s research helicopter Active Control Technology/ Flying Helicopter Simulator (ACT/FHS). The automatic slung load control system is being designed to extend the functionalities of the helicopter’s stability, control and augmentation system. The control system will be able to handle the challenges of rescue hoist operations. This means compensation of additional roll, pitch and yaw moments created by a significant distance of the load suspension point to the helicopter’s centre of gravity and the handling of a variable cable length. To measure the slung load motion, an optical-inertial sensor is being developed by iMAR Navigation GmbH. In this paper, the overall system architecture of HALAS as well as the hardware integration into the ACT/FHS is explained. The optical-inertial sensor used for the slung load dynamics measurement and estimation is described in detail.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the use of {{automatic}} fiscal stabilisers, particularly in relation to New Zealand’s experience over the past business cycle.

However, <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> does increase the potential for fiscal ill discipline. A risk is that an imprudent Government could allow the automatic stabilisers to operate during a downturn and not bank the gains in the upturn. The discipline imposed by the FRA in New Zealand helps ensure that the Government acts prudently. And a sound underlying fiscal position ensures that when policy action is required, it can be undertaken in a measured manner. Reflecting this, the New Zealand Government has allowed the automatic stabilisers to operate to a greater extent during the most recent recession than during the 1991 recession. ...|$|E

This paper provides evidence on the differing degrees of relative and absolute resilience of the household incomes of the new unemployed.

40|$|The global {{financial}} and economic crisis has revived {{the debate in}} the academic literature and in policy circles about the size and effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilisers.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} first five years of {{experience}} with the working of the EMU framework for fiscal policy in EMU. It is argued that the balance with the fiscal framework of EMU so far is mixed. The EMU framework has contributed to avoid large fiscal imbalances in EU Member States and has evolved continuously to deal with a number of budgetary challenges connected to the conduct of fiscal policy and the assessment of budgetary developments in the short, medium and long run. However, problems with the implementations of the rules have emerged, and the ownership of the framework should be re-established. We argue in favour of further improvements within the framework of the Treaty along the following directions:Â increased focus on debt and sustainability; better account of country-specific factors in the definition of medium-term targets; better enforcement of the rules; improved implementation of the excessive deficit procedure; greater account of the Lisbon goals in applying the EMU framework for economic policy co-ordination and budgetary surveillance.

40|$|The Great Recession did {{not only}} affect European {{countries}} to a varying extent, {{its impact on}} national labour markets and on specific socio-economic groups in those markets also varied greatly.

As the crisis gained momentum, the action of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> mechanisms built into the national tax-benefit and social protection systems was accompanied by heterogeneous sets of discretionary policy measures. While these factors can explain cross-country variation in labour market developments, they also lead to an unequal distribution of economic risks associated with the crisis across socio-economic groups.

40|$|This paper uses an {{estimated}} DSGE {{model for the}} euro area to {{study the effects of}} fiscal stabilisation policies. There are at least two features of the euro area economy which makes this analysis interesting. First, there are nominal rigidities in goods and labour markets, and there are financial market frictions with a significant share of liquidity constrained households. Second, the government is a major sector of the euro area economy. In this paper we look at fiscal stabilisation via government consumption, investment, transfers and wage taxes. Empirical evidence is found for systematic countercyclical fiscal policy. Consistent with previous findings, there is a small positive fiscal multiplier in the case of transitory fiscal shocks. It is found that fiscal policy is effective in stabilising GDP in the presence of demand and supply shocks. Fiscal policy helps to reduce the demand externality arising from nominal rigidities. In addition <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> via government transfers helps to smooth consumption of liquidity constrained household. Fiscal policy partly compensates the financial market distortion. With distorted goods, labour and financial markets it is found that the estimated fiscal policy rules reduce fluctuations in euro area GDP by about 14 percent.

40|$|After the crisis, {{the longstanding}} debate on a European {{unemployment}} benefits scheme (EUBS) was revived {{as part of}} a much larger debate on the need for a supranational <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> function for Europe. The American unemployment insurance (UI) system, given its two-tier structure, has often been regarded as a model for a potential EUBS. Previous research has examined the lessons to be learned from the US UI. This paper builds on this literature but goes one step further as it carefully assesses whether the lessons from the US system could actually be implemented in a European context. Indeed, while there are important parallels between the US and the EU in some areas, significant differences in others may complicate implementation or even render it impossible. In this paper, the aim, therefore, is to identify the aspects of the US system to draw inspiration from – in light of the EU’s institutional and political realities – and explain how they inform a potential EUBS. This exercise concentrates on the design and implementation of a potential EUBS. The paper highlights that a two-tier system helps to better attain the goals of unemployment insurance, as demonstrated by the American experience. It also shows the advantages of being pragmatic and taking an incentives-based approach. Other issues, such as solidarity and redistribution, seem more difficulty to tackle in Europe than in the American context and would require further examination. Finally, discretionary measures should be considered with caution...|$|E
40|$|Objective of {{doctoral}} thesis is to propose {{reform of the}} EU budget so that its revenues and expenditures follow the principles of theory of fiscal federalism, respecting the so far achieved level {{of economic and political}} integration. Normative theory of public finance is based on the notion of market failures that have to be solved by three basic functions of public finance: allocation, redistribution and stabilisation. Theory of fiscal federalism follows up with principles that should be respected when searching for the most suitable level of government to provide the three mentioned functions. Allocation function should be decentralised while stabilisation and redistribution function should be centralised. Still, these principles may be adjusted according to the character of integration grouping in question. The doctoral thesis assess to what extent do revenues and expenditures of the EU budget follow the three mentioned principles. Expenditures are assessed according to five criteria: stabilisation function, redistribution function, cross-border externalities, economies of scale and homogeneity of preferences. Based on assessment according to these criteria, the author recommends following changes in EU budget expenditures. Market related measures and direct payments together with expenditures of rural development policy related to enhancing {{the quality of life in}} rural areas and diversification of rural economy should be decentralised. Also the programme "Competitiveness and innovation" supporting small and medium-sized enterprises should be abolished. On the other hand, the reform proposal recommends to increase expenditures on research and development of European relevance, trans-European networks, protection of external frontiers, management of migration flows and development aid. The proposal also suggest to establish common defence policy financing common military research and development together with equipment and procurement. Another significant proposal suggests to establish an European unemployment fund working as an instrument of <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> and direct redistribution of the EU budget. Expenditure needs of the reformed budget are expressed in mathematical model at the level of 322, 5 billions of euro, which represents 2, 63 % GNI of EU- 27 in 2007. Revenues were assessed according to these criteria: stabilisation function, vertical equity, horizontal equity, cross-boarder externalities and relation to EU policies. On the basis of the assessment, it was recommended to abolish the current own resource based on VAT. On the other hand, the traditional own resources and resource based on GNI meet the criteria of fiscal federalism. The author also assessed several alternative resources of EU budget. Of these, excise taxes on motor-fuel spirits for road and air transport and to lesser extent also the real VAT were recommended as most suitable for the EU budget...|$|E
40|$|Introduction [...] . ] The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss this issue in the light of recent experience. It is divided into five sections. In section 2, we briefly discuss the {{economic}} benefits of macroeconomic stability and the rationale for government policies playing an active role in delivering it. Section 3 reviews the economic literature on the determinants of output volatility and its link with government size. Two separate strands of the literature are surveyed: cross-country studies focusing on OECD members and time-series studies of a single country, typically the United States. The cross-section studies confirm that countries with large governments tend to enjoy less output volatility, but also that there may be a threshold level beyond which the negative relationship disappears or even reverses. The studies that focus on the United States show, however, that the country has recently experienced an important reduction in output volatility, despite probably lying below this threshold and having witnessed a less pronounced increase in government size than most OECD countries. This suggests that something other than <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisation</b> has been at work: an exogenous fall in volatility, an increase in market-based stabilisation, or an improvement in monetary policy. Section 4 shows descriptive evidence on the size of government, macroeconomic volatility and the role of fiscal stabilisation policies in supporting consumption smoothing in the OECD countries, including 11 euro area members. The evidence confirms the contrast between time-series and cross-sectional studies. The main finding, however, is that the negative correlation between government size and output volatility, which is a major finding of the literature, seems to vanish for more recent cross-country data. In the traditionally volatile, small government countries, volatility has decreased substantially while government size has grown less than elsewhere. Section 5 builds on these stylised facts to present new econometric estimates of the relationship between government size and output volatility using both time-series and cross-country information. We first confirm that the traditional link between government size and macroeconomic volatility disappeared during the 1990 s. We then explore possible reasons for this breakdown, focusing on the role of improvements in the quality of monetary policy and on progress in financial development. The evidence suggests that monetary policy and financial development can both be substitutes for government size as a stabilising force, and that once this substitutability is taken into account, the relationship between government size and macroeconomic stability remains strong, though non-linear: the marginal effect of an increase in government size on output volatility is found to be negligible for public expenditure levels above 40 percent of GDP. Conclusions and policy implications are given in Section 6...|$|E
