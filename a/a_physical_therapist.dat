5|$|The two generals {{came up with}} a plan, and Middleton {{was sent}} to six Army {{installations}} in Tennessee, Colorado, and Washington D.C. with a brief stopover to visit his family in Baton Rouge. Middleton would be taking command of VIII Corps in England, and was sent to the various locations to confuse the enemy about the personnel change. Accompanying him was a sergeant who had been <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist</b> in civilian life, and who would massage Middleton's knees twice a day for the next year. When asked what staff he needed to take with him, Middleton replied that he would keep the staff that was already in place, except that for an aide he would like his old LSU friend, Mack Hornbeak, who had served with him through Sicily and Italy.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{therapy and}} {{occupational}} therapy {{may help to}} reduce tremor and improve coordination and muscle control for some patients. <b>A</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist</b> and/or occupational therapist will evaluate the patient for tremor positioning, muscle control, muscle strength, and functional skills. Teaching the patient to brace the affected limb during the tremor or to hold an affected arm close to the body is sometimes useful in gaining motion control. Coordination and balancing exercises may help some patients. Some occupational therapists recommend the use of weights, splints, other adaptive equipment, and special plates and utensils for eating.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual junkie {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and may very well be the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist,</b> Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

25|$|Immobility is a {{significant}} risk factor {{in the development of}} thrombosis. Immediate post-surgical interventions,(out of bed orders (OOB), are typically ordered by the physician to prevent thrombosis. These orders are typically delegated to a nurse, but may include the participation of <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist</b> and others trained to perform the intervention. are to perform range of motion (ROM) activities that include: muscle contractions of the lower legs for those who are very weak, moving the feet, wiggling the toes, bending the knees, raise and lower the legs. In addition, changes in positioning prevents immobility and shifts areas of venous stasis. If the person is too weak to perform these preventative activities, hospital personnel will perform these movements independently. Exercise of the lower extremeties is a post-operative method of prophlaxsis. Nursing personnel will often perform range of motion exercises and encourage frequent moving of the legs, feet, and ankles. Frequent positioning changes and adequate fluid intake. After a surgical procedure, ambulation as soon as possible is prophylactic in preventing the formation of blood clots.|$|E

500|$|People with Huntington's {{disease may}} see <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist</b> for {{non-invasive}} and non-medication-based ways {{of managing the}} physical symptoms. Physical therapists may implement fall risk assessment and prevention, as well as strengthening, stretching, and cardiovascular exercises. Walking aids may be prescribed as appropriate. Physical therapists also prescribe breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques {{with the development of}} respiratory problems. Consensus guidelines on physiotherapy in Huntington's disease have been produced by the European HD Network. Goals of early rehabilitation interventions are prevention of loss of function. Participation in rehabilitation programs during early to middle stage of the disease may be beneficial as it translates into long term maintenance of motor and functional performance. [...] Rehabilitation during the late stage aims to compensate for motor and functional losses. For long-term independent management, the therapist may develop home exercise programs for appropriate people.|$|E
500|$|Takanohana was {{affected}} by a liver disorder {{in the first half}} of 1998, which caused him withdraw from the January 1998 tournament and miss the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Nagano (his place was taken by Akebono).

Shunning the traditional treatment methods available from his stable, he turned instead to <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> <b>therapist</b> called Tashiro Tomita, who had a considerable influence over him. He became increasingly isolated from his father and brother, with his father claiming Takanohana had been [...] "brainwashed" [...] by Tomita.

Takanohana recovered to win the July and September 1998 tournaments, and was runner-up that November.

The two events led to widespread famine and economic woe in the region. Ross learned Russian {{at the behest of}} his mother, and developed a love of the theater and language. Ross's mother encouraged him to read, which he did often, and subscribed to a private library since Odessa had no public library. He credited his favorite uncle, an X-ray diagnostician, with introducing him to mathematics. The uncle had hired Samuil Shatunovsky to tutor his talented son, and Ross asked to join in. As money meant little due to inflation, Shatunovsky was paid to tutor the two boys with a pound of French hard candy. During this time, Ross was not taught with textbooks or lectured on geometric proofs. His geometry teacher would ask the class to prove and justify ideas on the blackboard per trial and error. Many universities were closed due to the famine, but Odessa University reopened and let a small group of adolescents attend, including Ross.|$|E
