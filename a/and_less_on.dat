5|$|A {{major change}} in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s after the development of wrought-iron-jacketed steel cannon by William Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles as a whole <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed {{the style of the}} cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|The progressions in {{northern}} art developed almost simultaneously {{with the early}} Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, {{to the extent that}} many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, {{as can be seen in}} the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} by Hampton Fancher was optioned in 1977. Producer Michael Deeley {{became interested in}} Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of Dune, wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised Filmways financing from US$13million to $15million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by William S. Burroughs for Alan E. Nourse's novel The Bladerunner (1974), titled Blade Runner (a movie). Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained {{the rights to the}} titles. Eventually he hired David Peoples to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.|$|E

5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 17th century, {{the play was}} famous for its ghost and vivid dramatisation of melancholy and insanity, leading to a {{procession}} of mad courtiers and ladies in Jacobean and Caroline drama. Though it remained popular with mass audiences, late 17th-century Restoration critics saw Hamlet as primitive and disapproved of its lack of unity and decorum. This view changed drastically in the 18th century, when critics regarded Hamlet as a hero—a pure, brilliant young man thrust into unfortunate circumstances. By the mid-18th century, however, the advent of Gothic literature brought psychological and mystical readings, returning madness and the ghost to the forefront. Not until the late 18th century did critics and performers begin to view Hamlet as confusing and inconsistent. Before then, he was either mad, or not; either a hero, or not; with no in-betweens. These developments represented {{a fundamental change in}} literary criticism, which came to focus more on character <b>and</b> <b>less</b> <b>on</b> plot. By the 19th century, Romantic critics valued Hamlet for its internal, individual conflict reflecting the strong contemporary emphasis on internal struggles and inner character in general. Then too, critics started to focus on Hamlet's delay as a character trait, rather than a plot device. This focus on character and internal struggle continued into the 20th century, when criticism branched in several directions, discussed in context and interpretation below.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} 1803–1804, {{a series of}} {{unsigned}} attacks on Young's theories appeared in the Edinburgh Review.

25|$|The {{organizational}} structure of German universities {{goes back to}} the university model introduced by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the early 19th century, which identifies the unity of teaching and research as well as academic freedom as ideals.
