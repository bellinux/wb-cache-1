500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal and {{no one is going to}} relate to this record <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> weren't before." ...|$|E

[...] "As a political party, while we love the homosexual community and {{want to get to}} know them better, we also have a stand where we say, children need to be protected.

2500|$|In 1978, Morrison {{recalled}} that he recorded the songs about {{four weeks after}} writing them: [...] "Veedon Fleece {{was a bunch of}} songs that I wrote and then I just recorded it about four weeks after I wrote it. [...] When you make an album you write some songs; you might have four songs <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> write two more, suddenly you've got enough songs for an album." [...] According to the drummer Dahaud Shaar, the tracks were laid down in a very informal manner: [...] "During that time I kinda haunted the studio, and Van would come in and we'd just do tracks." [...] David Hayes recalled about the recording sessions: [...] "Every night for about a week he came in with two or three new tunes and we just started playing with him." [...] Jim Rothermel also {{recalled that}} during the California recording sessions for the album the songs were often a first take and that the band members had sometimes not heard the songs previously. The strings and woodwinds were arranged by Jef Labes in a New York studio. [...] The song [...] "Come Here My Love" [...] was inspired during the week of the sessions and another song [...] "Country Fair" [...] was left over from the Hard Nose the Highway album [...] and provided a fitting sense of closure. [...] "Bulbs" [...] and [...] "Cul de Sac" [...] were recut in New York later with musicians with whom Morrison had never worked before: guitarist John Tropea, bassist Joe Macho and drummer Allen Schwarzberg. Given a rock music treatment, these songs were [...] released as the single for the album." ...|$|E
