The land where it had sat since 1930 was sold by the owners. Just prior to relocating the house, a vintage ring bearing the initials, [...] "F.B" [...] was found when a team armed with metal detectors gained permission to scan the location. This is presumed to have been owned by Fred Barker and has been added to the collection <b>along</b> <b>wirh</b> several bullet casings and assorted paraphernalia.|$|E
40|$|Rovost Date Due to {{escalation}} in complexity, {{capability and}} application, robot design is increasingly difficult. A design environment can automate many design tasks and relieve the designer’s burden. Prior to robot development. designers usually compose a robot from existing or custom developed components, simulate performance, optimize configuration and parameters, and write {{software for the}} robot. Robot designers customize these facets to the robot {{using a variety of}} software tools ranging from spreadsheets to C code to CAD tools. Valuable resoiirces are expended. and very little of this expertise and development is reusable. This research begins with the premise that a language to comprehensively represent robots is lacking and that the aforementioned design tasks can be automated once such a language exists. This research proposes and demonstrates the following thesis: “A ltrngunge fo represent robotx, <b>along</b> <b>wirh</b> n frtiniework to generole sirniilarioris, optimize desigrzs arid generare confro 1 software, iiicrerises flre effecliveriess of dzsigii. ‘...|$|E
40|$|While {{paying a}} due {{attention}} to the change in heat-coagulability of the serum of cancer patient, the author estimated the fluctuations of heat-resistant non-coagulating substance in the serum with polarography, and applying it on cancer diagnosis, studied the relationship between anemia, the leucocyte count, the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, and the liver function In addition, with the cases with gastric cancer the author studied {{the relationship between the}} fluctuations above mentioned and various supposed to exert in fluences on the height of the polarographic wave; and obtained the following results: 1. In the patients with gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers the polarography gives the negative cancer reaction in 100 per cent. 2. Gastric cancer patients show the positive cancer reaction in the polarograph in 92. 9 per cent. 3. In the patients with malignant tumors other than gastric tumor the cancer reaction is positive in 79. 2 per cent. Negative cases are found frequently in the cases with malignant tumors such as those of mammary glands and thyroid glands not belonging to the digestive system. 4. In various diseases other than malignant tumors (excepting gastric cancer) 73 per cent of them show negative cancer reaction, but positive raction can be frequently encountered in tuberculous disease, occlusion ileus, extensive disorders in the digestive system, and diseases of the reticulo-endothelial system. 5. No direct relationship can be recognized between the heat-resistant non-coagulation reaction of serum (Tsuda-Okujima's method) and the polarographic cancer reaction. 6. Neither any direct relationship can be observed between this cancer reaction and anemia, the leucocyte count, the plasma protein content, the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, the liver functon, and jaundice. 7. As for the cases with gastric cancer: a. No relationship can be recognized between existence or non-existence of free hydrochloric acid in gastric juice and the height of polarographic wave. b. The greater the size of gastric cancer the higher is the height of the polarographic wave. c. There is no relationship between the site of gastric cancer and the height of polarographic wave. d. In the macroscopic classification (Borrmann) of tumors, it has been found that the height of polarographic weve increases <b>along</b> <b>wirh</b> the progress of the disease from type I to type IV. e. In those histologically suggesting undifferentiation and a higher degree of malignancy, the height of the polarographii wave is higher. f. Summarily viewing the course of progress in the symptoms of gastric cancer, as the disease progresses from the early stage to the terminal stage, the height of polarographic wave becomes higher...|$|E
