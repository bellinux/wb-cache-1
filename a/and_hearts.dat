Hibs won all four of their ties at the first attempt, defeating two other SPL clubs and two Scottish Football League clubs. After winning against Junior club Auchinleck Talbot in the fourth round, Hearts defeated three other SPL clubs to reach the final. Hearts needed a replay to eliminate St Johnstone then they beat St Mirren, then beat cup holders Celtic in the semi-final.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Hibs' 12th {{appearance}} in the Scottish Cup final and Hearts' 14th. Hibs had previously won two finals <b>and</b> <b>Hearts</b> had won seven. Because both teams were from Edinburgh, {{many of the city}} councillors requested that the final be held in Edinburgh at Murrayfield Stadium, instead of the traditional venue of Hampden, in Glasgow. The previous final between the two clubs in 1896 had been held in Edinburgh but on this occasion it stayed in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian {{players have}} been capped at full {{international}} level for 22 different national teams, with 61 Hibernian players appearing for Scotland. Hibernian rank fifth amongst all clubs in providing players for Scotland, behind the Old Firm, Queen's Park <b>and</b> <b>Hearts.</b> James Lundie and James McGhee were the first Hibs players to play for Scotland, in an 1886 British Home Championship match against Wales. Lawrie Reilly holds the record for most international caps earned while a Hibs player, making 38 appearances for Scotland between 1949 and 1957.

5|$|The latter {{years of}} the 19th century was East Stirlingshire's most {{successful}} era in the Scottish Cup.

In the 1888–89 tournament, the club recorded its highest win and equalled it in successive rounds with a 10–1 victory against local rivals Stenhousemuir in the first round and an 11–2 win over Vale of Bannock in the second round. It was during this period that four East Stirlingshire players earned international caps for their countries. The first was the Wales national team captain, Humphrey Jones, who earned five caps whilst with the club. Three other players, David Alexander, Archibald Ritchie, and James McKie made appearances for the Scotland national team from 1891 to 1898.|$|E

Since the lung <b>and</b> the <b>heart</b> are the vital organ of human, therefore the needs of immediate preventive and curative actions are primarily important. Here, the frequency separation of breath sound is carried out by using the modulation filtering method.

40|$|Abstract: Electromagnetic spectra reduce {{melatonin}} {{production and}} delay the nadirs of rectal temperature <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate. Seven healthy men (16 – 22 yrs) completed 4 permuted sessions. The control session {{consisted of a}} 24 -hours bedrest at < 30 lux, 18 °C, and < 50 dBA. In the experimental sessions, either light (1 500 lux), magnetic field (16. 7 Hz, 0. 2 mT), or infrared radiation (65 °C) was applied from 5 pm to 1 am. Salivary melatonin level was determined hourly, rectal temperature <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate were continuously recorded. Melatonin synthesis was completely suppressed by light but resumed thereafter. The nadirs of rectal temperature <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate were delayed. The magnetic field had no effect. Infrared radiation elevated rectal temperature <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate. Only bright light affected the circadian rhythms of melatonin synthesis, rectal temperature, <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate, however, differently thus causing a dissociation, which might enhance the adverse effects of shiftwork in the long run...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac reinnervation late after heart {{transplantation}} {{has been}} reported in individual patients. As a measure for reinnervation, circadian changes in arterial blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate have been used but not yet systemically evaluated in cardiac transplant recipients.

A loss of physiological nocturnal decline in blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate was noted early after transplantation, whereas late after operation an improvement in circadian changes of blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate was observed. The patients late after heart transplantation had a significant higher diastolic blood pressure. A pathological circadian blood pressure <b>and</b> <b>heart</b> rate pattern was observed in patients early after heart transplantation, which was improved late after operation. This could be explained by partial reinnervation of the heart. Diastolic hypertension late after transplantation may be due to cyclosporine treatment and/or neuroendocrine hyperactivity...|$|R
