40|$|A simple latex {{agglutination}} test (SLAT) {{based on}} modifications of existing serodiagnostic techniques, in which commercially available reagents are used, was developed for detection of antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tests performed on 553 serum samples from 316 individuals, including 117 bacteriologically confirmed active tuberculosis patients, showed 80 % positive titers. Sera from 12 patients with <b>arrested</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> showed 91 % positive titers. Nonspecific reactions were noted in 5 % of 160 serums from selected normal individuals and patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. The antibodies detected by the SLAT method {{were found to be}} relatively stable when exposed to low temperatures, whereas high temperatures reduced the antibody titer considerably. Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid inactivation of serum complement was found to be satisfactory. No variation of tuberculosis antibody titer was noted in tests on multiple specimens from patients whose conditions were stabilized. However, considerable fluctuation was encountered in antibody titers obtained on recently detected individuals. Data obtained in this study indicate that the modified procedures of the SLAT method could replace the tuberculin skin test for simple screening of tuberculosis in adults...|$|E
40|$|Periodic mass {{examinations}} {{to detect}} tuberculosis had been conducted every {{year during the}} period from 1947 to 1956 at the town of Goi in Chiba Prefecture, which has a population of about 12, 000. By studying persons who were diagnosed as having tuberculosis, investigations were performed on the following subjects : 00 The trend of transition of the disease from year to year; (2) The relationship of the acquisition of sensitivity to tuberculin and the onset of the disease, with special reference to the onset of the disease in persons who had positive tuberculin tests at the time of initial examinations; and (3) The course of the disease, especially of those who had not received any treatment during the period of observations. The results of the investigations are summarized as follows; (1) The ratio of the persons examined to the whole population ranged from 27. 6 per cent to 64. 8 per cent. The ratio of the persons having positive tuberculin tests to all the persons examined was 42. 0 per cent {{in the first year of}} examinations, while it was 73. 2 per cent in the last year. Persons inoculated with BCG vaccine because of having negative or doubtful positive tuberculin tests represented on an average 83. 6 per cent of those who were examined every year. (2) The presence of tuberculosis was determined in 2. 9 per cent of persons having examinations in the first year and in 5. 6 per cent in the last year. A follow-up study of patients with tuberculosis showed that those with primary tuberculosis and infiltrative tuberculosis tended to decrease in number, while those with indurative tuberculosis tended to increase in number. (3) The persons who were diagnosed as having tuberculosis during the whole period of examinations were 631 in number, representing 5. 8 per cent of a total of 10, 764 persons examined during that period. Of these 621 persons, 213 persons (2. 0 per cent) had active tuberculosis. There were larger percentages of persons with both active and <b>arrested</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in middleaged and aged groups than in any other groups. (4) Observations had been made of the persons with tuberculosis for from 1 to 9 years who had received no treatment during that period. It was revealed that in patients with primary tuberculosis, about 80 per cent manifested improvement; in patients with infiltrative and mixed type tuberculosis, about 30 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, showed exacerbation; and in patients with productive-fibrotic tuberculosis, about 95 per cent remained unchanged. (5) Of 1, 673 persons who had positive tuberculin tests at the time of initial examinations and who had been followed up for relatively long period, i. e. for from 5 to 9 years, 321 persons had tuberculosis. Retroactive examinations of screen photographs (35 mm films) of 220 persons whose diseases were detected after the second year of examination showed that 218 persons had had tuberculosis at the time of initial examinations and that only 2 persons (0. 12 per cent) had been free from tuberculosis at the time of initial examinations and might, therefore, have developed it after the second year of examinations. (6) Abnormal roentgenographic shadows of non-tuberculous origin were seen witn 39 out of a total of 10, 764 persons having mass examinations. These persons were divided into the following groups according to the results of clinical diagnosis : 14 with bronchiectasis, 7 with the so-called transitory infiltration, 4 with atypical pneumonia, 5 with thickenning of the pleura, 5 with benign tumor, 2 with lung cancer, 1 with pulmonary bulla and 1 with lung abscess...|$|E

40|$|Resistance to {{commonly}} used antituberculosis drugs is emerging worldwide. Conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods are slow and demanding. Alternative, rapid DST methods would permit the {{early detection of}} drug resistance and, in turn, <b>arrest</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> transmission. A cost-effectiveness analysis of 5 DST methods was performed {{in the context of}} a clinical trial that compared rapid with conventional DST methods. The methods under investigation were direct phage-replication assay (FASTPlaque-Response; Biotech), direct amplification and reverse hybridization of the rpoB gene (INNO-LiPA; Innogenetics), indirect colorimetric minimum inhibitory concentration assay (MTT; ICN Biomedicals), and direct proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. These were compared with the widely used indirect proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. All alternative DST methods were found to be cost-effective, compared with other health care interventions. DST methods also generate substantial cost savings in settings of high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Excluding the effects of transmission, the direct proportion method on Löwenstein-Jensen medium was the most cost-effective alternative DST method for patient groups with prevalences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of 2 %, 5 %, 20 %, and 50 % (cost in US$ 2004, $ 94, $ 36, $ 8, and $ 2 per disability-adjusted life year, respectively).

40|$|Summary: This review {{hopes to}} improve the {{selection}} of new tuberculosis (TB) vaccines by providing several perspectives on the immunization of humans, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and monkeys which have not usually been considered. (i) In human TB vaccine trials, the low rate of healing of Mycobacterium bovis BCG lesions (used as the control group) would distinguish individuals who might be helped by vaccination from the 95 % who do not need it and would make these trials more conclusive. (ii) The rabbit immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is much more effective in <b>arresting</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> than those of other laboratory animals, so pulmonary tubercle counting in rabbits {{should be included in}} all preclinical TB vaccine testing. (iii) Both delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) are necessary to control the growth of M. tuberculosis. The testing of new TB vaccines in mice or in guinea pigs may not detect important antigens needed for human immunization. Mice respond poorly to tuberculin-like antigens that cause DTH. Guinea pigs respond poorly to antigens that cause CMI. Rabbits and humans respond well to both DTH and CMI antigens. Since monkeys are very susceptible to M. tuberculosis, they may not be as useful as rabbits for preclinical vaccine evaluation. (iv) Critical antigens (possibly ESAT- 6 or CFP- 10) might increase the immunity of the host {{to a greater extent than}} that produced by a natural M. tuberculosis infection and therefore would be useful in both prophylaxis and immunotherapy. Such critical antigens would increase the host's ability to neutralize key components of M. tuberculosis that enable it to survive in both laboratory animals and humans...|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>arrests</b> phagosomal {{maturation}} in infected macrophage, and, {{apart from}} health significance, provides a superb model system to dissect the phagolysosomal biogenesis pathway. Here, we demonstrate {{a critical role}} for the small GTPase Rab 14 in maintaining mycobacterial phagosome maturation block. Four-dimensional microscopy showed that phagosomes containing live mycobacteria accumulated Rab 14 following phagocytosis. The recruitment of Rab 14 had strong functional consequence, as a knockdown of endogenous Rab 14 by siRNA or overexpression of Rab 14 dominant-negative mutants (Rab 14 S 25 N and Rab 14 N 125 I) released the maturation block and allowed phagosomes harboring live mycobacteria to progress into phagolysosomes. Conversely, overexpression of the wild-type Rab 14 and the constitutively active mutant Rab 14 Q 70 L prevented phagosomes with dead mycobacteria from undergoing default maturation into phagolysosomal organelles. Mechanistic studies demonstrated a role for Rab 14 in stimulating organellar fusion between phagosomes and early endosomes but not with late endosomes. Rab 14 enables mycobacterial phagosomes to maintain early endosomal characteristics and avoid late endosomal/lysosomal degradative components...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis phagosome in human monocyte-derived macrophages acquires markers of early and late endosomes, but direct evidence of interaction of the M. tuberculosis phagosome with the endosomal compartment has been lacking. Using the cryosection immunogold technique, we have found that the M. tuberculosis phagosome acquires exogenously added transferrin in a time- dependent fashion. Near-maximal acquisition of transferrin occurs within 15 min, kinetics of acquisition consistent with interaction of the M. tuberculosis phagosome with early endosomes. Transferrin is chased out of the M. tuberculosis phagosome by incubation of the infected macrophages in culture medium lacking human transferrin. Phagosomes containing latex beads or heat-killed M. tuberculosis, on the other hand, do not acquire staining for transferrin. These and other findings demonstrate that M. <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>arrests</b> the maturation of its phagosome at a stage at which the phagosome interacts with early and late endosomes, but not with lysosomes. The transferrin endocytic pathway potentially provides a novel route for targeting antimicrobials to the M. tuberculosis phagosome...|$|R
40|$|After phagocytosis, the {{intracellular}} pathogen Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>arrests</b> {{the progression}} of the nascent phagosome into a phagolysosome, allowing for replication in a compartment that resembles early endosomes. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that govern phagosome maturation arrest, we performed a visual screen {{on a set of}} M. tuberculosis mutants specifically attenuated for growth in mice to identify strains that failed to arrest phagosome maturation and trafficked to late phagosomal compartments. We identified 10 such mutants that could be partitioned into two classes based on the kinetics of trafficking. Importantly, four of these mutants harbor mutations in genes that encode components of the ESX- 1 secretion system, a pathway critical for M. tuberculosis virulence. Although ESX- 1 is required, the known ESX- 1 secreted proteins are dispensable for phagosome maturation arrest, suggesting that a novel effector required for phagosome maturation arrest is secreted by ESX- 1. Other mutants identified in this screen had mutations in genes involved in lipid synthesis and secretion and in molybdopterin biosynthesis, as well as in genes with unknown functions. Most of these trafficking mutants exhibited a corresponding growth defect during macrophage infection, but two mutants grew like wild-type M. tuberculosis during macrophage infection. Our results support the emerging consensus that multiple factors from M. tuberculosis, including the ESX- 1 secretion system, are involved in modulating trafficking within the host...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{responsible}} for nearly 1. 4 million deaths globally every year and continues to remain {{a serious threat to}} human health. The problem is further complicated by the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), emphasizing the need for the development of new drugs against this disease. Phagosomal maturation arrest is an important strategy employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to evade the host immune system. Secretory acid phosphatase (SapM) of M. tuberculosis is known to dephosphorylate phosphotidylinositol 3 -phosphate (PI 3 P) present on phagosomes. However, there have been divergent reports on the involvement of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest in mycobacteria. This study was aimed at reascertaining the involvement of SapM in phagosomal maturation <b>arrest</b> in M. <b>tuberculosis.</b> Further, for the first time, we have also studied whether SapM is essential for the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. By deleting the sapM gene of M. tuberculosis, we demonstrate that MtbDsapM is defective in the arrest of phagosomal maturation as well as for growth in human THP- 1 macrophages. We further show that MtbDsapM is severely attenuated for growth in the lungs and spleen of guinea pigs and has a significantly reduced ability to cause pathological damage in the host when compared with the parental strain. Also, the guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM exhibited a significantly enhanced survival when compared with M. tuberculosis infected animals. The importance of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest {{as well as in the}} pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis establishes it as an attractiv...|$|R

SM was a dministered in 18) cases of vesical tuberculosis (78 cases before nephrectomy and 102 postoperatively) and in 8 of prostatic tuberculosis. INAH was administered in 33 cases of vesical tuberculosis (21 cases before nephrectomy and 12 postoperatively), in 9 of prostatic tuberculosis and in one of urethral tuberculosis. Although quite high potency is available both in SM and INAH, the former is superior to the latter in the point of rapid effect while the latter is excellent in being free from any sequela. In regard to the clinical difference between SM and INAH, comparative investigations were carried out on the changes of symptoms in connection with the urinary bladder, ureter, prostate and the urethra. The following figures are showing the limits of chemotherapy car r ied out on renal tuberculosis with the purpose of its clinical cure : In 13 cases of unilateral tuberculosis : 33. 3 % (In insignificant cases : 57. 1 %) In 9 cases of bilateral tuberculosis : 55. 5 % (In insignificant cases : 71. 4 %) Out of the total 22, 10 cases dem o nstrated effectual results corresponding to 45. 49.

40|$|In bacteria, {{nucleoid}} associated proteins (NAPs) {{represent a}} prominent group of global regulators that perform {{the tasks of}} genome compaction, establishing chromosomal architecture and regulation of various DNA transactions like replication, transcription, recombination and repair. HU, a basic histone like protein, {{is one of the}} most important NAPs in Eubacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a homodimeric HU (MtbHU), which interacts with DNA non-specifically through minor groove binding. Exploration for essential genes in Mtb (H 37 Rv) through transposon insertion has identified HU coding gene [Rv 2986 c, hupB; Gene Id: 15610123; Swiss-Prot ID: P 95109) ] to be vital for the survival and growth of this pathogen. MtbHU contains two domains, the N-terminal domain which is considerably conserved among the HU proteins of the prokaryotic world, and a C–terminal domain consisting of Lys-Ala rich multiple repeat degenerate motifs. Sequence analysis carried out by the thesis candidate showed that MtbHU exhibits 86 to 100 percent identity within the N-term region among all the mycobacterium species and some of the members of actinobacteria, including important pathogens like M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. ulcerans, M. bovis, Nocardia; while C term repeat region varies relatively more. This strikingly high cross species identity establishes the MtbHU N-terminal domain (MtbHUN) as an important representative structural model for the above mentioned group of pathogens. The thesis candidate has solved the X-ray crystal structure of MtbHUN, crystallized in two different forms, P 2 and P 21. The crystal structures in combination with computational analyses elucidate the structural details of MtbHU interaction with DNA. Moreover, the similar mode of self assembly of MtbHUN observed in two different crystal forms reveals that the same DNA binding interface of the protein can also be utilized to form higher order oligomers, that HU is known to form at higher concentrations. Though the bifunctional interface involved in both DNA binding and self assembly is not akin to a typical enzyme active site, the structural analysis identified key interacting residues involved in macromolecular interactions, allowing us to develop a rationale for inhibitor design. Further, the candidate has performed virtual screening against a vast library of compounds, and design of small molecules to target MtbHU and disrupt its binding to DNA. Various biochemical, mutational and biological studies were performed in the laboratory of our collaborator Prof. V. Nagaraja, MCBL, IISc., to investigate these aspects. After a series of iterations including design, synthesis and validation, we have identified novel candidate molecules, which bind to MtbHU, disrupt chromosomal architecture and <b>arrest</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> growth. Thus, the study suggests that, these molecules can serve as leads for a new class of DNA-interaction inhibitors and HU as a druggable target, more so because HU is essential to Mtb, but absent in human. Our study proposes that, targeting the nucleoid associated protein HU in Mtb can strategize design of new anti-mycobacterial therapeutics. Perturbation of MtbHU-DNA binding through the identified compounds provides the first instance of medium to small molecular inhibitors of NAP, and augurs well for the development of chemical probe(s) to perturb HU functions, and can be used as a fundamental chemical tool for the system level studies of HU-interactome. Section I: “Crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis histone like protein HU and structure based design of molecules to inhibit MtbHU-DNA interaction: Leads for a new target. ” of this thesis presents an elaborate elucidation of the above mentioned work. The candidate has additionally carried out structure based computational and theoretical work to elucidate the interaction of amino acid based metal complexes which efficiently bind to DNA via minor-groove, major-groove or base intercalation interaction and display DNA cleavage activity on photo-irradiation. This understanding is crucial for the design of molecules towards Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). PDT is an emerging method of non-invasive treatment of cancer in which drugs like Photofrin show localized toxicity on photoactivation at the tumor cells leaving the healthy cells unaffected. The work carried out in our group in close collaboration with Prof. A. R. Chakravarty of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry Department elaborates the structure based design of Amino acid complexes containing single Cu (II), such as [Cu(L-trp) (dpq) (H 2 O) ]+, [Cu (L-arg) 2](NO 3) 2, Amino acid complexes containing oxobridged diiron Fe(III), such as [{Fe(L-his) (bpy) } 2 (μ-O) ](ClO 4) 2, [{Fe(L-his) (phen) } 2 (μ-O) ](ClO 4) 2, and Complexes containing Binuclear Cu(II) coordinated organic moiety, such as [{(dpq) CuII} 2 (μ-dtdp) 2], which bind to DNA through minor groove/major groove/base intercalation interactions. Docking analysis was performed with the X-ray crystallographic structure of DNA as receptor and the metal complexes as ligands, to study the mode of binding to DNA and to understand the possible mode of DNA cleavage (single/double strand) when activated with laser. Section II: “Structure based computational and theoretical analysis of metal coordinated complexes containing amino acids and organic moieties designed for photo induced DNA cleavage” of this thesis presents a detailed presentation of the above mentioned work...|$|R
