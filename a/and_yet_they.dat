5|$|The {{day after}} the final Japanese assault on the knoll, 292 dead Japanese were counted around 'B' Company's perimeter. In total, {{over the course of}} the battle, the Australians counted 620 Japanese killed, and {{estimated}} that another 1,000 had probably been wounded. Information obtained from captured Japanese clarified that the Australians had come up against a force of at least 2,400 troops. The commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Kawano Koji, was among the dead, as was a senior divisional staff officer, Lieutenant Colonel Honda Matsuo. Four wounded Japanese were also taken prisoner of war. Casualties for the Australians included 10 officers and 179 other ranks killed or wounded, while there had been a further 81 Australians evacuated due to non-combat related issues. Wartime Japanese casualty estimates vary from these figures, though, claiming to have killed 1,800 Australians, while placing their own losses at 280 killed and 320 wounded. Long argues that these figures are problematic, as based upon the same report, the Japanese believed that there were only 400 Australians in the region during the battle, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> claimed to have killed almost five times that number.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, a Cohen–Macaulay ring is a {{commutative}} {{ring with}} some of the algebro-geometric properties of a smooth variety, such as local equidimensionality. Under mild assumptions, a local ring is Cohen–Macaulay exactly when it is a finitely generated free module over a regular local subring. Cohen–Macaulay rings {{play a central role in}} commutative algebra: they form a very broad class, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> are well understood in many ways.|$|E

When war erupts, Chaereas successfully storms the Persian stronghold of Tyre on behalf of the Egyptian rebels, and then wins a naval victory against the Persians, after which the lovers are finally reunited. Callirhoe writes to Dionysius, telling him to bring up her son and send him to Syracuse when he grows up. Chaereas and Callirhoe return in triumph to Syracuse, where Callirhoe offers prayers to Aphrodite, who has guided the events of the narrative.|$|E

He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|James Hildreth {{scored a}} quick 46 off 26 {{deliveries}} at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres set a challenging target of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. No Glamorgan bowler really had {{control over the}} Somerset batsmen, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> lost their wickets. A highlight of the innings was the effort of Somerset's No. 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before part-timers Keith Parsons and Hildreth {{got the better of}} them and took wickets at a leisure - however, Alex Wharf hung in there with Michael Powell and carried the Dragons to 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, which of course was pleasing to the home side.|$|E

25|$|To access this region, two provincial roads: Provincial Route No. 28 (gravel), {{linking the}} towns of Tanti with Taninga (near the town of Salsacate). After {{traveling}} nearly 40km from Tanti, and climb over 1,700 meters you reach the far north of the region, more precisely {{at the foot of}} the massif 'Los Gigantes'. From there you can follow the same route to the town of Taninga. The second option is the provincial route RP 34 (tarmac), located about 30km south of the former. It crosses the city of Villa Carlos Paz, crossing {{the towns of}} San Antonio de Arredondo, Villa Icho Cruz, Mayu Sumaj, Cuesta Blanca, and deposited us in the Pampa de Achala. This road is also known as Camino de las Altas Cumbres or route Jorge Raúl Recalde, in tribute to this rally racer. Continuing along the same route, it accesses the Traslasierra Valley. While these are the two most relevant options, there are regional roads and tourist access to reach specific sectors within the region. As mentioned above, except for these two alternatives, the other, in most cases are suitable only for special vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> can not access certain areas.|$|E

500|$|On April 28, 2008, Beghe posted online {{a letter}} to Church leader David Miscavige, {{requesting}} the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions. In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> maintain these files about what people have said to them in private sessions. Why would you want these people to hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the conspirators}} {{expressed}} worries about fellow Catholics {{who would be}} caught up in the planned explosion; Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and when the young Earl of Arundel's name was mentioned Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. Keyes's suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was, however, derided. On 26October William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton, warning him not to attend Parliament, and forecasting that [...] "they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> shall not see who hurts them". Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to go hunting with James, but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle's servant. He immediately suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour. Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator, and threatened to [...] "hang him", but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, and the next day urged them to abandon the plot.|$|E

A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of being a kid soprano, a true phenomenon.

But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>they</b> rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish."
