The {{findings}} indicate that the susceptibility to these phages is primarily a group-specific phenomenon, although it is modified by several {{factors such as the}} hyaluronic acid capsule, lysogeny, and possibly the presence of surface proteins.

This is in agreement with the observation that group A phages are not specific for their homologous streptococcal types. The purified group C carbohydrate inactivates group C phage but not the group A phages, thus suggesting that the carbohydrate, a component of the cell wall, may serve as the phage receptor site. It has not been possible to inactivate the group A phages with group A carbohydrate.
