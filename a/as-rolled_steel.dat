40|$|Manganese {{partitioning}} {{and long}} fibrous martensite were obtained in several dual-phase steels by annealing, followed by hot rolling {{in their respective}} intercritical annealing temperature regions. The volume fraction of martensite was varied by changing the intercritical annealing temperature. Long annealing times were required to obtain complete manganese partitioning {{in order to increase}} the strength of the austenite phase and subsequently the martensite phase. Post-roll annealing improves the ductility through ferrite recrystallisation and also by changes to the martensite morphology, however, this results in a decrease in strength. The <b>as-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> shows two distinct work-hardening processes with different exponents and shows a laminated fracture appearance due to the ribbon-like morphology of the martensite...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} electron microscopical {{investigation of}} three Ti-Nb Al deoxidized steels with different N:Ti ratios has been undertaken. In each steel, {{a large number}} of small (< 10 nm) particles were observed. Parallel electron energy loss spectroscopy (PEELS) showed that their compositions in the three steels were consistent with those reported for the caps on the TiN cores in the equivalent steels in Part I, i. e. NbC 0. 7 N 0. 3, NbC and (Nb 0. 7 Ti 0. 3) C, respectively. The Nb incorporated in these caps added to that dissolved in the TiN cores results in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} small particles which give effective dispersion hardening. The size of this reduction depends on a number of competing factors. AlN precipitation also occurred in the <b>as-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> with highest N content and in the normalized steels with the two higher N contents. AlN is usually expected to control the austenite grain growth. NbC-based material grew on the AlN. A dendritic complex based on the iso-structural compounds MnSiN 2 and AlN was observed in the high N steel...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{of carbon}} (black) steel {{reinforcing}} bars (rebar) {{is the major}} cause of damage and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures in maritime regions and in climates where de-icing salts are used. The cause of the corrosion is diffusion of chloride ions to the steel surface through the concrete {{in which it is}} placed. The bars are naturally passivated by the high pH of concrete interstitial pore fluid, and will not corrode in chloride-free concrete. Chloride ions break down the passive film, allowing dissolution of the steel. Corrosion of reinforcing steel drastically reduces the service lives of concrete structures. Where chlorides can not be avoided, stainless steel is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative reinforcing material. Stainless steel is able to withstand greater concentrations of chlorides, extending the service lives of structure in which they are placed. Due to high initial cost, stainless steel is often avoided in the design of new structures. In order to reduce the cost of stainless rebar, it has been proposed that the standard process of abrasive blasting and pickling of the steels not be performed, as these steps are mainly used to restore a bright and shiny surface, a quality not required for steels embedded in concrete. AISI 304 LN, AISI 316 LN and 2205 duplex stainless steels were tested with pickled surfaces as well as with mill-scale intact (as-rolled) {{in order to determine the}} affect of pickling vs. not pickling on the corrosion behaviour of the steels. Steels were tested in solutions simulating concrete interstitial pore fluid containing from 0 to 16 % Cl- by mass of solution, simulating cement paste with 0 to 7. 5 % Cl- by mass of cement, which is near the solubility limit of Cl- in pore fluid. Steels were also tested in thin mortar shells, with Cl- ions being rapidly diffused to the surface due to an applied potential gradient. The microcell corrosion performance of the <b>as-rolled</b> <b>steels</b> was slightly worse than that of pickled steels; however, the corrosion rates of the <b>as-rolled</b> <b>steels</b> at 16 % Cl- in pore fluid are near 3 µm/year, while black steel is normally observed to be actively corroding at 10 µm/year in cement containing as low as 0. 1 % Cl- by mass of cement, or 0. 2 % Cl- by mass of solution. No significant difference was observed between different grades of stainless steel in either the as-rolled or pickled conditions. <b>As-rolled</b> stainless <b>steels</b> exhibited poor pitting resistance when an anodic potential is applied, but the corrosion occurs at potentials much higher than experienced in service and at Cl- concentrations far greater than that needed to initiate corrosion on black steel; the time required to reach these higher Cl- levels would allow for maintenance free service long enough to justify the cost of <b>as-rolled</b> stainless <b>steel</b> over black steel. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code, CSA S 6 - 06, specifies that reinforced concrete bridges should meet a service life of 75 years. It is concluded that, given the time required for concentrated chlorides to accumulate at the steel, the stainless steel rebar in the as-rolled condition would allow reinforced concrete structures to reach the specified service life, as long as care is taken to avoid contamination of the steel/surface by black steel from handling, or by secondary phases within the steel, Cr 23 C 6 and MnS in particular...|$|R
40|$|Deterioration of {{reinforced}} concrete structures due primarily to chloride induced corrosion of plain carbon-steel reinforcement {{is a widespread}} problem, particularly in areas close to marine environments and where de-icing salts are used to keep roadways clear of ice. Replacing plain carbon-steel rebar with highly corrosion resistant stainless steel rebar {{has been shown to}} greatly increase the lifespan of concrete structures in harsh environments, and yields favourable life-cycle costs despite high initial costs. In attempt to lower stainless steel rebar’s initial cost of processing, this research compared its corrosion resistance in the pickled (mill scale removed) and as-rolled (mill scale intact) surface conditions. Rebar was embedded in highly-chloride contaminated concrete, and corrosion performance between the two surface types was compared in order to determine if conventional pickling of stainless steel rebar is necessary. A second part of this research addressed possible concern of reduced corrosion resistance of pickled stainless steel rebar in concrete exposed to chlorides when subjected to dynamic loading due to micro-motion at the concrete/crack interface. It was concluded that <b>as-rolled</b> stainless <b>steel</b> rebar in aggressive environments would provide sufficient corrosion resistance for the 75 year lifespan currently specified by the Canadian Bridge Code (CAN/CSA-S 6 - 06, 2006), however it is recommended that monitoring of these specimens be continued to ensure high corrosion rates and/or concrete cracking do not develop. As well, investigation into the effects crevice corrosion cells found in typical concrete structures could have on <b>as-rolled</b> stainless <b>steel</b> rebar’s corrosion resistance should be undertaken. With regard to loading conditions, no significant evidence was found suggesting that pickled stainless steel rebar has reduced corrosion resistance when loaded dynamically versus statically. Therefore pickled stainless steel rebar is recommended for use in dynamically loaded concrete structures if others factors permit. However, the higher electrochemical noise measured during cyclic loading suggests that corrosion behaviour could be influenced largely by frequency of loading, and so further study should be undertaken for applications involving more extreme cyclic loading conditions than those used in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to study {{critically}} the effects of heat treatment on the properties of rolled medium carbon steel. Representative samples of <b>as-rolled</b> medium carbon <b>steel</b> were subjected to heat treatment processes which are; Quenching, Lamellae Formation and Tempering {{in the following order}} (Q + Q + L + T), (Q + L + T) and (L + T). The steel was heated to the austenizing temperature of 830 ºC and water quenched. The quenched steel was subjected to lamellae formation by reheating it to the ferrite-austenite dual-phase region at a temperature of 745 ºC below the effective A C 3 point and then rapidly quenched in water. The lamellae formed was tempered at 480 ºC to provide an alloy containing strong, tough and lath martensite in a soft and ductile ferrite matrix. Mechanical tests {{were carried out}} on the samples and the results shows that the steel developed has excellent combination of tensile strength, hardness and impact strength which is very good for structural applications. The corrosion behaviour of the samples; heat treated rolled medium carbon <b>steel</b> and <b>as-rolled</b> medium carbon <b>steel</b> in sodium chloride medium were also investigated from where it was also confirmed that improved corrosion resistance is achievable by the treatment...|$|R
40|$|Crystallographic {{reconstruction}} of parent austenite grain boundaries from the martensitic microstructure in a wear resistant steel {{was carried out}} using electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD). The present study mainly aims to investigate the parent austenite grains from the martensitic structure in an <b>as-rolled</b> (reference) <b>steel</b> sample and samples obtained by quenching at different cooling rates with corresponding dilatometry. Subsequently, {{this study is to}} correlate the nearest cooling rate by the dilatometer which yields a similar orientation relationship and substructure as the reference sample. The Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship was used to reconstruct the parent austenite grain boundaries from the martensite boundaries in both reference and dilatometric samples using EBSD crystallographic data. The parent austenite grain boundaries were successfully evaluated from the EBSD data and the corresponding grain sizes were measured. The parent austenite grain boundaries of the reference sample match the sample quenched at 100 °C/s (CR 100). Also the martensite substructures and crystallographic textures are similar in these two samples. The results from hardness measurements show that the reference sample exhibits higher hardness than the CR 100 sample due to the presence of carbides in the reference sample.

40|$|Abstract. Cryogenic cooling is an {{environmental}} friendly and effective cooling technology. The present work investigates {{the role of}} cryogenic cooling on tool wear at various cutting conditions. An indigenous method of applying cryogenic coolant was developed. Different methods of circulating the liquid nitrogen and vaporizing it inside the tool holder were tried {{with the objective of}} lowering down the temperature at the cutting zone. This was achieved through more efficient heat transfer. <b>As-rolled</b> AISI 4340 <b>steel</b> shafts were turned using coated cemented carbide inserts. Results of tool wear show improvement of tool life during cryo-machining as compared to dry machining especially when heavy depths of cut, high feed values and high cutting speeds are employed. The effect of cryogenic cooling was not pronounced at low speeds, small feed and depths of cut...|$|R
40|$|Manganese {{partitioning}} {{and mechanical}} properties of dual phase steels have been examined. The manganese partitioning coefficient increases to a limit with increasing isothermal holding time, {{and the final}} equilibrium partitioning coefficient decreases with increasing annealing temperature. The combination of diffusion equations in austenite and ferrite plus mass balance and austenite growth can give the manganese distribution in austenite and ferrite respectively, and the manganese partitioning coefficient at any isothermal holding time. The introduction of rolling during annealing or {{at the end of}} annealing can strengthen dual phase steels by elongating austenite and introducing internal stresses and dislocations, the magnitude of which depends on finishing rolling temperature and the timing of rolling during annealing. The tensile properties of <b>as-rolled</b> dual phase <b>steels</b> are strongly influenced by finishing rolling temperature and martensite volume fraction because of internal stresses and dislocation density, whereas those of post-rolling annealed steels depend on only martensite volume percentage. To model the heat-treatment for producing dual phase steels (“in-situ” dual phase steel), a steel-steel composite is produced by incorporating high strength steel-wires into ductile steel sheets through hot-rolling (“artificial” dual phase steel). The properties of the reinforcing wire, matrix steels, interfacial strength between wire and matrix steels and steel-steel composite are affected by the surface condition of wire, finishing rolling temperature, preform holding time at rolling temperature before rolling, and heat-treatment after fabrication of composites. Mileiko’s theory can predict the relationship between the steel-steel composite strength and the volume fraction of wire. But for dual phase steels, Mileiko’s theory can be applied only when martensite volume fraction is over 30 % because the residual stress, high dislocation density and carbide are produced at low temperature, at which low martensite volume fraction is obtained. Continuous wire composites can simulate the <b>as-rolled</b> dual phase <b>steel</b> when the reinforcement content is over 30 %, but discontinuous wire composites can not simulate the post-rolling annealed dual phase steel...|$|R
40|$|The {{grain growth}} {{behaviour}} during reheating between 950 ºC and 1300 ºC of as-cast Al-Nb steel (containing 0. 019 wt% Nb and 0. 057 wt% Al) and rolled Nb-containing steel (containing 0. 028 wt% Nb and 0. 031 wt% Al) have been investigated. In particular {{the role of}} microalloying element segregation during casting and, hence the spatial distribution of microalloying precipitates, on grain boundary pinning during reheating has been considered. The Al-Nb containing steel has been examined in separate initial conditions, including as-cast (segregated structure), homogenised and forged (reduced separation of segregated bands) samples. It was found that microalloy segregation occurred between the dendritic and interdendritic regions, where the secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) was 150 ± 50 μm. Nb showed strong segregation into the interdendritic regions resulting in a higher number density of Nb(C,N) precipitates (2. 64 × 104 /mm 2) compared to the dendritic region (0. 73 × 104 /mm 2). However, Al did not show strong segregation resulting in relatively well-distributed AlN precipitates in the matrix (1. 29 × 104 /mm 2 in the interdendritic region and 1. 89 × 104 /mm 2 in the dendritic region). After forging, the separation between the segregated bands was reduced to 65 ± 10 μm from the previous 150 ± 50 μm in the as-cast sample. The increased Nb content in the rolled Nb-containing steel compared to the Al-Nb steel gave a greater extent of segregation in the solute-enriched regions resulting in a larger number density of Nb(C,N) present (5. 9 × 104 /mm 2), whilst the separation between in the segregated bands in the <b>as-rolled</b> Nb-containing <b>steel</b> was 35 ± 10 μm...|$|R
40|$|The 'published {{literature}} on strength, structural and thermal aspects of hot working has been reviewed with particular reference to their {{application to the}} hot rolling of stainless steel. Mild and stainless steel slabs. have been hot rolled on a mill instrumentated to measure load, torque and speed. Internal temperatures have been measured during rolling using embedded thermocouples whose outputs have been recorded on a U. V. recorder coupled with an automatic back-off system. <b>As-rolled</b> stainless <b>steel</b> slabs recrystallised very slowly relative to the rate found by previous workers for simpler austenitic stainless steels. Additionally, slabs exhibited retarded recrystallisation at the surface compared with the centre whereas theoretical analysis predicts the reverse. These phenomena have been explained by rapid precipitation at temperatures 950 oC and limited electron microscopical evidence has been obtained to support this. Precipitation also increased the flow stresses at lower rolling temperatures and masked any effects that different substructures were expected {{to have on the}} hot strength. A finite difference computer programme has been developed to predict the temperature changes that occur through a two dimensional transverse section of a slab during a hot rolling SChedule. The air cooling and roll contact heat transfer coefficients have been derived by comparison of measured and computed temperature-time curves. This programme enabled a mean pass temperature to be derived from measured temperatures which then resulted in good agreement between hot strengths derived from rolling and torsion tests on stainless steel. The programme has been simplified to a one dimensional model for simulating temperature changes over central regions of wide sections during industrial hot rolling. Data have been presented to enable mean temperatures to be derived from measured surface temperatures and to illustrate the effects of various parameters on the heat loss during a pass...|$|R
40|$|Rail steels rely {{primarily}} on possessing adequate wear and rolling contact fatigue resistance. These properties, {{together with the}} toughness, can in principle be optimized by implementing thermomechanical processing assisted by controlled niobium additions. The {{purpose of the current}} work is to develop a Nb-microalloying strategy in the context of high-carbon pearlitic and cementite-free bainitic steels. The conventional methods do not leave the critical regions of a rail section in a suitably processed state. An attempt has been made for the first time, to create a pancaked austenite grain structure, with an examination of the consequences on the final product. One of the major difficulties is to ensure that niobium does not segregate during manufacturing, since niobium is a strong carbide former and rail steels traditionally contain large carbon concentrations. Niobium solubility in austenite has been assessed critically and thermodynamic calculations for microsegregation have been taken into account. The aim is to ensure that any primary niobium carbide precipitated from solute-enriched liquid during non-equilibrium solidification, can be taken into solution in austenite during reheating, to mitigate potential effects of coarse precipitates on the final mechanical properties. Rail steels containing 0. 01 - 0. 02 wt% Nb have been designed and characterised. In as-cast condition, primary niobium carbides as large as ~ 10 µm can be observed, which dissolve slowly during reheating. An attempt has been made to develop a model to estimate the dissolution kinetics of the carbides. Dissolved niobium in reheated austenite precipitates during hot deformation as fine niobium carbides (< 50 nm) which inhibit austenite recrystallisation by pinning the austenite grain boundaries. Nb-microalloying increases the ‘no-recrystallisation temperature’ of deformed austenite during multi-pass compression tests. The topology of grain deformation has been analysed in terms of stereological calculations and dilatometric experiments have shown that transformation kinetics tend to accelerate when the austenite is deformed below the no-recrystallisation temperature, however the effect is relatively small. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the <b>as-rolled</b> Nb-microalloyed <b>steels</b> have been characterised along with their rolling-sliding wear performance and compared with their non-microalloyed counterparts. Increased austenite grain boundary area and increased dislocation activity due to pancaking, hinder bainite growth which leads to an increased retained austenite volume fraction. This in turn, leads to slightly improved ductility, improved toughness and improved wear resistance in Nb-microalloyed bainitic alloys. Microstructural refinement in Nbmicroalloyed pearlitic alloys does not have any significant effect on tensile and toughness properties, but wear resistance improves significantly. A Bayesian neural network model has been developed to estimate the wear of rails. Predicted trends have been found consistent with metallurgical experience and the perceived noise levels are consistent with reasonable repeatability of the wear testing method used. The model can be applied widely to estimate wear because of its capacity to indicate uncertainty, including both the perceived level of noise in the output, and an uncertainty associated with fitting the function in the local region of input space...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the surface hardening of steels via experimental tests using a multi-kilowatt fiber laser as the laser source. The influence of laser power and laser power density on the hardening effect was investigated. The microhardness analysis of various laser hardened steels was done. A thermodynamic model was developed to evaluate the thermal process of the surface treatment of a wide thin steel plate with a Gaussian laser beam. The effect of laser linear oscillation hardening (LLOS) of steel was examined. An <b>as-rolled</b> ferritic-pearlitic <b>steel</b> and a tempered martensitic steel with 0. 37 wt% C content were hardened under various laser power levels and laser power densities. The optimum power density that produced the maximum hardness {{was found to be}} dependent on the laser power. The effect of laser power density on the produced hardness was revealed. The surface hardness, hardened depth and required laser power density were compared between the samples. Fiber laser was briefly compared with high power diode laser in hardening medium-carbon steel. Microhardness (HV 0. 01) test was done on seven different laser hardened steels, including rolled steel, quenched and tempered steel, soft annealed alloyed steel and conventionally through-hardened steel consisting of different carbon and alloy contents. The surface hardness and hardened depth were compared among the samples. The effect of grain size on surface hardness of ferritic-pearlitic steel and pearlitic-cementite steel was evaluated. In-grain indentation was done to measure the hardness of pearlitic and cementite structures. The macrohardness of the base material was found {{to be related to the}} microhardness of the softer phase structure. The measured microhardness values were compared with the conventional macrohardness (HV 5) results. A thermodynamic model was developed to calculate the temperature cycle, Ac 1 and Ac 3 boundaries, homogenization time and cooling rate. The equations were numerically solved with an error of less than 10 - 8. The temperature distributions for various thicknesses were compared under different laser traverse speed. The lag of the was verified by experiments done on six different steels. The calculated thermal cycle and hardened depth were compared with measured data. Correction coefficients were applied to the model for AISI 4340 steel. AISI 4340 steel was hardened by laser linear oscillation hardening (LLOS). Equations were derived to calculate the overlapped width of adjacent tracks and the number of overlapped scans in the center of the scanned track. The effect of oscillation frequency on the hardened depth was investigated by microscopic evaluation and hardness measurement. The homogeneity of hardness and hardened depth with different processing parameters were investigated. The hardness profiles were compared with the results obtained with conventional single-track hardening. LLOS was proved to be well suitable for surface hardening in a relatively large rectangular area with considerable depth of hardening. Compared with conventional single-track scanning, LLOS produced notably smaller hardened depths while at 40 and 100 Hz LLOS resulted in higher hardness within a depth of about 0. 6 mm...|$|R
