5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of <b>arbitrariness.</b> First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of <b>arbitrariness.</b> As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|The {{widely known}} sources {{including}} published and written memoirs by victims of psychiatric <b>arbitrariness</b> convey moral and physical sufferings {{experienced by the}} victims in special psychiatric hospitals of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|There is some <b>arbitrariness</b> {{to which}} glyphs are grouped together, {{and there are}} {{inconsistencies}} in the assignments of numerical codes {{and the use of}} affixes which make the system rather complex. However, despite its shortcomings, Barthel's is the only effective system ever proposed to categorize rongorongo glyphs.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of <b>arbitrariness</b> are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|Following his Macedonian triumph, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by his officer Cleonymus. The Spartan convinced the Epiriote king to aid him in a scheme to seize control of his homeland. Cleonymus' reasons for seeking to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he was angry {{that he had been}} overlooked for the Agiad kingship of Sparta in favour of his nephew, Areus II. Plutarch ascribes Cleonymus' failure to secure the throne to his <b>arbitrariness</b> and violent nature. Furthermore, Cleonymus had become a target of ridicule in Sparta by the fact that his new wife, Chilonis, was engaging in an affair with Acrotatus, the son of Areus.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{seizure of}} the Macedonian throne, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by a Spartan Prince, Cleonymus who was serving as an officer in his army. The Spartan persuaded Pyrrhus to assist him in his plot to capture Sparta. Cleonymus' motives in wanting to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he bore a grudge because his countrymen had overlooked him in favour of his nephew, Areus I when determining the successor of the Agiad throne. Plutarch, the Greek historian, attributed Cleonymus' non-selection as king to his violent disposition and <b>arbitrariness.</b> Moreover, Cleonymus had been slighted because his new wife, Chilonis, had been seduced by Areus' son, Arcotatus. These perceived insults spurred Cleonymus to leave Sparta and scheme to usurp the throne.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the <b>arbitrariness</b> of the linguistic sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words and words build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds and words, that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stage of French settlement, legal matters fell within the Governor of New France's purview. Under this arrangement, legal {{disputes}} were settled in an incoherent fashion due to the Governor's <b>arbitrariness</b> in issuing verdicts.|$|E

25|$|It is {{only fair}} {{to admit that}} the task of imputing an {{intention}} to the parties in the third situation presents the courts with another opportunity for uncertainty and <b>arbitrariness,</b> but this overall approach is nevertheless felt to be the lesser of the available evils.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{indirect}} rule was to allow natives to govern their own affairs through “customary law.” In practice though, the native authority decided on and enforced its own unwritten rules {{with the support}} of the colonial government. Rather than following the rule of law, local chiefs enjoyed judicial, legislative, executive, and administrative power in addition to legal <b>arbitrariness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kretzer's play thereby is {{described}} as intellectual comprehension of the text, which {{is in fact the}} secret to the legitimacy of natural, emotionally justified forming. He gives area to the inspiration of the moment without getting lost in <b>arbitrariness</b> or mannerisms. He puts manual virtuosity in the service of precise articulations, rhythmic precision and a dynamic highly versatile, orchestral tone intended color palette.|$|E
25|$|Too great obsequiousness or abjection of oneself; {{this would}} be {{considered}} an excess of humility, and could easily be derogatory to one's office or holy character; or it might serve only to pamper pride in others, by unworthy flattery, which would occasion their sins of tyranny, <b>arbitrariness,</b> and arrogance. The virtue of humility may not be practiced in any external way that would occasion vices in others.|$|E
25|$|A {{differential}} equation of motion, usually identified as some physical law and applying definitions of physical quantities, {{is used to}} set up an equation for the problem. Solving the {{differential equation}} will lead to a general solution with arbitrary constants, the <b>arbitrariness</b> corresponding to a family of solutions. A particular solution can be obtained by setting the initial values, which fixes the values of the constants.|$|E
25|$|The {{disillusionment with}} {{domestic}} socio-economic elites at municipal {{and national levels}} was expressed at the 2012–2013 Slovenian protests on a wider scale than in the smaller 15 October 2011 protests. In relation to the leading politicians' response to allegations made by the official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, legal experts expressed the need {{for changes in the}} system that would limit political <b>arbitrariness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mendeleev wrote that, 'It is... {{impossible}} {{to draw a}} strict line of demarcation between metals and nonmetals, there being many intermediate substances'. Several other sources note confusion or ambiguity as {{to the location of}} the dividing line; suggest its apparent <b>arbitrariness</b> provides grounds for refuting its validity; and comment as to its misleading, contentious or approximate nature. Deming himself noted that the line could not be drawn very accurately.|$|E
25|$|The case {{brought by}} the {{defenders}} of the old faith found many supporters among different strata of the Russian society, which would give birth to the Raskol movement. A {{part of the old}} faith low-ranking clergy protested against the increase of feudal oppression, coming from the church leaders. Some members of the high-ranking clergy joined the Raskol movement due to their discontent over Nikon's aspirations and the <b>arbitrariness</b> of his church reforms.|$|E
25|$|Krylenko {{promoted}} {{his views}} on socialist legality during the work on two drafts of the Soviet Penal Code, one in 1930 and one in 1934. Krylenko's views were opposed by some Soviet theoreticians, including the Soviet Prosecutor General Andrey Vyshinsky, who argued that Krylenko's imprecise definition of crimes and his refusal to define terms of punishment introduced legal instability and <b>arbitrariness</b> and were, therefore, against {{the interests of the}} Soviet state. The debate continued throughout 1935 and was inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|This same year, {{and against}} the advice of Galician nobility, the Catholic monarchs sent to Galicia a Castilian police and {{military}} corps, the Santa Hermandad, soon criticised not only as an institution composed mostly by foreigners, but also as a heavy burden to the local economy, raising and consuming more than 6 million maravedi per year—the budget of Columbus' first journey to America was of just 2 million maravedi—whilst also becoming growingly unpopular due to its <b>arbitrariness</b> and rudeness with the local inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The {{disillusionment with}} {{domestic}} socio-economic elites at municipal and the State's level was expressed at the 2012–2013 Slovenian protests on a wider scale {{than in the}} smaller 15 October 2011 protests – Slovenian disillusionment with the elites and financial institutions at the European and global level. In relation to the leading politicians' response to allegations made by official Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia, law experts expressed the need {{for changes in the}} system that would limit political <b>arbitrariness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 'lower house' {{politicians}} are elected to represent smaller constituencies. The 'upper house' is usually elected to represent {{states in a}} federal system (as in Australia, Germany or the United States) or different voting configuration in a unitary system (as in France). In the UK the upper house is appointed by the government as a house of review. One criticism of bicameral systems with two elected chambers is that {{the upper and lower}} houses may simply mirror one another. The traditional justification of bicameralism is that an upper chamber acts as a house of review. This can minimise <b>arbitrariness</b> and injustice in governmental action.|$|E
25|$|Ortega y Montañés was {{a native}} of Cartagena. Some sources give a {{different}} birth date: June 23, 1627. He studied at Cartagena, at Málaga, and at Alcalá de Henares, where he graduated with a doctorate in jurisprudence. He was named inquisitor for New Spain, and it was there that he entered the service of the Church. He was bishop of Durango, then Guatemala, then Michoacán (Valladolid). He was known for his opposition to clerical abuse and <b>arbitrariness,</b> and also for his support of simple happiness and poverty among the clergy. He had also a reputation for charity, concern for the parishioners, and energy in his work.|$|E
25|$|A traditional, {{widespread}} view {{of these}} reforms {{is that they}} only affected the external ritualistic side of the Russian Orthodox faith and that these changes were deemed a major event by the religious Russian people. However, these reforms, apart from their <b>arbitrariness,</b> established radically different relations between {{the church and the}} faithful. It soon became obvious that Nikon had used this reform for the purpose of centralization of the church and strengthening of his own authority. Nikon's forcible introduction of the new divine service books and rituals caused a major estrangement between the Zealots of Piety and Nikon. Some of its members stood up for the old faith and opposed the reforms and patriarch's actions.|$|E
25|$|The Black Parents Movement later {{formed an}} {{alliance}} with the Black Youth Movement and the Race Today Collective, which had, with the Race Today journal, by then separated from the IRR. Together they established a formidable cultural and political movement, successfully fighting many cases against police oppression and <b>arbitrariness</b> and for better state education. It was the Alliance that formed the New Cross Massacre Action Committee {{in response to the}} alleged arson attack which resulted in the death of 14 young blacks, and mobilised 20,000 black people and their supporters in March 1981 to protest the death of the young people and the failure of the police to conduct a proper investigation. La Rose was Chairman of the New Cross Massacre Action Committee.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasonable}} relation test {{applied to}} Article 12(1) by the Privy Council {{has been applied}} {{in a number of}} local and foreign cases. It was reformulated into a three-stage test by the Court of Appeal in Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong (1998). The Court applied {{a modified version of the}} test to situations involving the discriminatory application of neutral laws in Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), and expressed the view that Article 12(1) would only be infringed in such cases where there was intentional and arbitrary discrimination, or inequalities due to inadvertence or inefficiency on a very substantial scale. The element of <b>arbitrariness</b> was also mentioned by the Court in Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988) – it said a law that allows a public authority to exercise arbitrary discretionary power is in violation of Article 12(1).|$|E
25|$|The {{integrals}} of the XYZ {{color matching}} functions must all be equal by requirement 3 above, {{and this is}} set by the integral of the photopic luminous efficiency function by requirement 2 above. The tabulated sensitivity curves have {{a certain amount of}} <b>arbitrariness</b> in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 XYZ color spaces are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{scene is}} very formal with a long, {{ceremonial}} introduction, {{but as the}} combatants are about to fight, Richard interrupts and sentences both to banishment from England. Bolingbroke is originally sentenced to ten years' banishment, but Richard reduces this to six years upon seeing John of Gaunt's grieving face, while Mowbray is banished permanently. The king's decision {{can be seen as}} the first mistake in a series leading eventually to his overthrow and death, since it is an error which highlights many of his character flaws, displaying as it does indecisiveness (in terms of whether to allow the duel to go ahead), abruptness (Richard waits until the last possible moment to cancel the duel), and <b>arbitrariness</b> (there is no apparent reason why Bolingbroke should be allowed to return and Mowbray not). In addition, the decision fails to dispel the suspicions surrounding Richard's involvement in the death of the Duke of Gloucester – in fact, by handling the situation so high-handedly and offering no coherent explanation for his reasoning, Richard only manages to appear more guilty. Mowbray predicts that the king will sooner or later fall at the hands of Bolingbroke.|$|E
500|$|Stage 2. Is the {{discrimination}} founded on intelligible ? ("Intelligible differentia" [...] is defined {{under the first}} form of <b>arbitrariness.)</b> ...|$|E
500|$|... (a) Are persons {{falling into}} the same class treated equally? If all the persons in the class are equally {{discriminated}} against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against, then {{the law does not}} offend this second order of <b>arbitrariness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some classifier-noun pairings are arbitrary, or {{at least}} appear to modern {{speakers}} to have no semantic motivation. For instance, the classifier bù {{may be used for}} movies and novels, but also for cars and telephones. Some of this <b>arbitrariness</b> may be due to what linguist James Tai refers to as [...] "fossilization", whereby a count-classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns. For example, the classifier pǐ used for horses is meaningless today, but in Classical Chinese may have referred to a [...] "team of two horses", a pair of horse skeletons, or the pairing between man and horse. <b>Arbitrariness</b> may also arise when a classifier is borrowed, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not. In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain [...] "prototypical" [...] nouns (such as horse) rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus <b>arbitrariness</b> has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers. Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct: in their conception, some classifiers constitute [...] "well-defined categories", others make [...] "prototype categories", and still others are relatively arbitrary.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{approach}} in Ong Ah Chuan, Judge of Appeal M. Karthigesu, sitting {{as a judge}} of the High Court in Taw Cheng Kong, sought to succinctly express the reasonable classification test {{as a means to}} combat three forms of <b>arbitrariness.</b> This can be expressed as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|However, the Public Prosecutor {{qualified}} {{the statement}} {{by providing a}} limitation, namely, that [...] "the <b>arbitrariness,</b> the disregard of fundamental rules of natural justice for which the Act provides, must be of general application to all citizens of Singapore {{so as to avoid}} falling foul of the anti-discriminatory provisions of Art 12(1)".|$|E
500|$|John of Küküllő {{emphasized}} that Louis [...] "ruled neither with passion, nor with <b>arbitrariness,</b> {{but rather as}} the guardian of righteousness". Antonio Bonfini also described Louis as a just king wandering among his subjects in disguise to protect them the royal officials' arbitrary acts. Even Jan of Czarnków underlined that Louis [...] "did not rule in an absolute manner; on the contrary, the foundations ... of [...] freedom were laid by him".|$|E
