40|$|This is the {{official}} water pollution site for Canada. In the introduction, the problem is stated with reference to pollutants of the Great Lakes over 360 chemical compounds have been identified. Many are persistent toxic chemicals - <b>alkylated</b> <b>lead,</b> benzo(a) pyrene, DDT, mercury and mirex - potentially dangerous to humans and already destructive to the aquatic ecosystems. In referring to water quality, pollutants, toxic substances, and acid rain in the aquatic environment are discussed along with long-range transport of airborne pollutants and toxic chemicals {{said to be the}} legacy of a chemical society. Efforts to control water pollution include a multi-barrier approach to protecting drinking water, stated water quality objectives and guidelines, regulations, and advice on how to be a responsible consumer. Other sections include the effects of pollution and groundwater pollution. Educational levels: High school, Middle school, Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|E
40|$|The ethene {{oligomerization}} {{performance of}} heterogeneous, Ni-based acid catalysts has been assessed by combining experimental measurements and Single-Event MicroKinetic (SEMK) modelling. In {{addition to the}} independently determined physisorption parameters, two catalyst descriptors, i. e., the ethene coordination enthalpy on the Ni-ion sites and the alkene protonation enthalpy on the acid sites, sufficed to adequately describe experimental data acquired on 1. 8 wt% Ni-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 and 4. 9 wt% Ni-Beta zeolite. While Ni-sites ensure ethene dimerization, further alkylation, isomerization and cracking reactions occur on the acid sites. Unavoidably, <b>alkylated</b> species <b>lead</b> to product inhibition by hindering the accessibility of active Ni-ion sites for ethene. Very pronounced product physical adsorption was demonstrated to even result in reduced ethene conversion and, hence, catalyst activity. Through extensive reaction pathway analyses, guidelines for rational catalyst design for heterogeneous, Ni-based acid catalysts were proposed which are simulated to lead to selectivities of 60 % towards 1 - alkenes, 50 % towards gasoline and 25 % towards propene...|$|R
40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization in-source decay (MALDI-ISD) is {{initiated}} by hydrogen transfer from matrix molecules to the carbonyl oxygen of peptide backbone with subsequent radical-induced cleavage leading to c 0 /z• fragments pair. MALDI-ISD {{is a very}} powerful method to obtain long sequence tags from proteins or to do de novo sequencing of peptides. Besides classical fragmentation, MALDI-ISD also shows specific fragments for which the mechanism of formation enlightened the MALDI-ISD process. In this study, the MALDI-ISD mechanism is reviewed, and a specific mechanism is studied in details: the N-terminal side of Cys residue (Xxx-Cys) is described to promote the generation of c 0 and w fragments in MALDI-ISD. Our data suggest that for sequences containing Xxx-Cys motifs, the N–Ca bond cleavage occurs following the hydrogen attachment to the thiol group of Cys side-chain. The c•/w fragments pair is formed by side-chain loss of the Cys residue with subsequent radical-induced cleavage at the N–Ca bond located at the left side (N-terminal direction) of the Cys residue. This fragmentation pathway preferentially occurs at free Cys residue and is suppressedwhen the cysteines are involved in disulfide bonds. Hydrogen attachment to alkylated Cys residues using iodoacetamide gives free Cys residue by the loss of •CH 2 CONH 2 radical. The presence of alkylated Cys residue also suppress the formation of c•/w fragments pair via the (Cb) -centered radical, whereas w fragment is still observed as intense signal. In this case, the z• fragment formed by hydrogen attachment of carbonyl oxygen followed side-chain loss at <b>alkylated</b> Cys <b>leads</b> to a w fragment. Hydrogen attachment on peptide backbone and side-chain of Cys residue occurs therefore competitively during MALDI-ISD process. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} and implementation of transparent electron transport materials (ETM) in vacuum deposited p-i-n type organic solar cells (OSC) for substituting the parasitically absorbing standard ETM composed of n-doped C 60. In addition to transparency in the visible range of the sun spectrum, the desired material properties include high electron mobility and conductivity, thermal and morphological stability, as well as good energy level alignment relative to the adjacent acceptor layer which is commonly composed of intrinsic C 60. In this work, representatives of three different material classes are evaluated {{with regard to the}} above mentioned criteria. HATCN (hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile) is a small discoid molecule with six electron withdrawing nitrile groups at its periphery. It forms smooth thin films with an optical energy gap of 3. 3 eV, thus being transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. Doping with either 5 wt% of the cationic n-dopant AOB or 7 wt% of the proprietary material NDN 1 effectively increases the conductivity to 7. 6 * 10 ^- 6 S/cm or 2. 2 * 10 ^- 4 S/cm, respectively. However, the fabrication of efficient OSC is impeded by the exceptionally high electron affinity (EA) of approximately 4. 8 eV that causes the formation of an electron injection barrier between n-HATCN and intrinsic C 60 (EA= 4. 0 eV). This work presents a strategy to remove the barrier by introducing doped and undoped C 60 intermediate layers, thus demonstrating the importance of energy level matching in a multi-layer structure and the advantages of Fermi level control by doping. Next, a series of six Bis-Fl-NTCDI (N,N-bis(fluorene- 2 -yl) -naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide) compounds, which only differ by the length of the alkyl chains attached to the C 9 positions of the fluorene side groups, is examined. When increasing the chain length from 0 to 6 carbon atoms, the energy levels remain nearly unchanged: We find EA= 3. 5 eV as estimated from cyclic voltammetry, an ionization potential (IP) in the range between 6. 45 eV and 6. 63 eV, and Eg,opt= 3. 1 eV which means that all compounds form transparent thin films. Concerning thin film morphology, the addition of side chains results in the formation of amorphous layers with a surface roughness < 1 nm on room temperature glass substrates, and (1. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm for deposition onto glass substrates heated to 100 °C. In contrast, films composed of the side chain free compound Bis-HFl-NTCDI exhibit a larger surface roughness of (2. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm and 9 nm, respectively, and are nanocrystalline already at room temperature. Moreover, the conductivity achievable by n-doping is very sensitive to the side chain length: Whereas doping of Bis-HFl-NTCDI with 7 wt% NDN 1 results in a conductivity in the range of 10 ^- 4 S/cm, the attachment of alkyl chains causes a conductivity which is more than three orders of magnitude smaller despite equal or slightly higher doping concentrations. The insufficient transport properties of the <b>alkylated</b> derivatives <b>lead</b> to the formation of pronounced s-kinks in the jV -characteristics of p-i-n type OSC while the use of n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI results in well performing devices. The last material, HATNA-Cl 6 (2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15 - hexachloro- 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18 -hexaazatrinaphthylene), exhibits Eg,opt= 2. 7 eV and is therefore not completely transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. However, its energy level positions of EA= 4. 1 eV and IP= 7. 3 eV are well suited for the application as ETM in combination with i-C 60 as acceptor. The compound is dopable with all available n-dopants, resulting in maximum conductivities of sigma= 1. 6 * 10 ^- 6, 3. 5 * 10 ^- 3, and 7. 5 * 10 ^- 3 S/cm at 7. 5 wt% AOB, Cr 2 (hpp) 4, and NDN 1, respectively. Applying n-HATNA-Cl 6 instead of the reference ETM n-C 60 results in a comparable or improved photocurrent density at an ETM thickness d(ETM) = 40 nm or 120 nm, respectively. At d(ETM) = 120 nm, the efficiency eta is more than doubled as it increases from eta(n-C 60) = 0. 4 % to eta(n-HATNA-Cl 6) = 0. 9 %. Optical simulations show that the replacement of n-C 60 by n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI, n-HATNA-Cl 6, or the previously studied n-NTCDA (naphthalenetretracarboxylic dianhydride) in p-i-n or n-i-p type device architectures is expected to result in an increased photocurrent due to reduced parasitic absorption. For quantifying the gain, the performance of p-i-n type OSC with varying ETM type and thickness is evaluated. Special care has to be taken when analyzing devices comprising the reference ETM n-C 60 as its conductivity is sufficiently large to extend the area of the aluminum cathode and thus the effective device area which may lead to distorted results. Overall, the experiment is able to confirm the trends predicted by the optical simulation. At large ETM thickness in the range between 60 and 120 nm, the window layer effect of the ETM is most pronounced. For instance, at d(ETM) = 120 nm, eta(C 60) is more than doubled using n-HATNA-Cl 6 and even more than tripled using n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI or n-NTCDA. At optimized device geometry the photocurrent gain is slightly less than expected but nonetheless, the efficiency is improved from eta(max) = 2. 1 % for n-C 60 and n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells to eta(max) = 2. 3, and 2. 4 % for n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI and n-NTCDA devices, respectively. This development is supported by generally higher Voc and FF in solar cells with transparent ETM. Finally, p-i-n type solar cells with varying ETM are aged at a temperature of 50 °C and an illumination intensity of approximately 2 suns. Having extrapolated lifetimes t(80) of 36, 500, and 14000 h and nearly unchanged jV-characteristics after 2000 h, n-C 60 and n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI devices exhibit the best stability. In contrast, n-NTCDA devices suffer from a constant decrease in Isc while n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells show a rapid dscegradation of both Isc and FF associated with a decomposition of the material or a complete de-doping of the ETM. Here, lifetimes of only 4500 h and 445 hare achieved...|$|R
