5000|$|Due to the {{idiosyncratic}} {{nature of}} mercury toxicity, {{the risk of}} severe disease and sudden death are unpredictable and frequently show no warning signs. Physicians during the 20th century believed that a fever/rash complex suggested the risk of severe side effects for the next upcoming doses if treatment was not halted. Warkany and Hubbard (1953) noted in their seminal paper establishing mercury {{as the cause of}} infantile <b>acrodynia</b> that [...] "... in modern times the capricious behavior of mercurial diuretics has been rather disturbing to those who use them frequently. Thousands of injections are given without untoward effects but occasionally a therapeutic dose results in sudden death. Only rarely is this caused by the first dose. More often the patient tolerates several - in one case 164 - doses before the fatal reaction occurs. The mechanism of these reactions is not clear: they can neither be explained nor predicted; yet they cannot be denied." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ironically, while {{teething}} is {{a natural}} process which creates little more than discomfort, some methods for relieving teething pain have caused serious harm and even death. Old remedies for teething include [...] "blistering, bleeding, placing leeches on the gums, and applying cautery {{to the back of}} the head". In the sixteenth century the French surgeon Ambroise Paré introduced the lancing of gums using a lancet, in the belief that teeth were failing to emerge from the gums due to lack of a pathway, and that this failure was a cause of death. This belief and practice persisted for centuries, with some exceptions, until towards the end of the nineteenth century lancing became increasingly controversial and was then abandoned, although as late as 1938 an Anglo-American dental textbook advised in favour of lancing, and described the procedure. In the first half of the twentieth century, teething powders in the English-speaking world often contained calomel, a form of mercury. It was removed from most powders in 1954 when it was shown to cause [...] "pink disease" [...] (<b>acrodynia),</b> a form of mercury poisoning.|$|E

40|$|Since Gyorgy {{reported}} as rat <b>acrodynia</b> {{on the specific}} dermatitis of the vitamin B_ 6 deficient rat, {{there have been many}} reports in the dermatological field discussing the therapeutical effect of B_ 6.

The main impressions were epidermal hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis and the inter as well as intracellular edema. The upper part of the dermis showed edems and vascular dilatations, and the follicular sebaceous glands were usually atrophic. The activity of alkaline-phosphatase was ultimately lowered.

40|$|Abstract: A {{superantigen}} or autoimmunity {{has been}} hypothesized {{to be the}} main cause of the Kawasaki`s Disease but the etiology is unknown. Medical literature, epidemiological findings, and some case reports have suggested that mercury may play a pathogenic role. Several patients with Kawasaki`s Disease have presented with elevated urine mercury levels compared to matched controls. Most symptoms and diagnostic criteria which are seen in children with <b>acrodynia,</b> known to be caused by mercury, are similar to those seen in Kawasaki´s Disease. Genetic depletion of glutathione S-transferase, a susceptibility marker for Kawasaki´s Disease, is known to be also a risk factor for <b>acrodynia</b> and may also increase sus-ceptibility to mercury.

40|$|The diet {{originally}} (1) {{and still}} commonly {{used for the}} production of "rat <b>acrodynia,</b> " the specific vitamin Be deficiency disease in this animal, consists of casein, cane sugar (or rice starch), melted butter fat, cod liver oil and salt mixture and is supplemented with vitamin BI and riboflavin. During the last few years it has become evident that this ration lacks at least two (2) and probably more factors (3), one of which is vitamin Bs. Under the conditions chosen, vitamin Be deficiency is the primary disturbance and prevails over the other deficiencies. This is an illustration of the phenomenon of "concurrence " or "competition " of vitamin deficiency diseases. In a previous paper (3) observations were reported to the effect that this rule might have its exception even under identical conditions. For example, in several instances of <b>acrodynia</b> which had developed in rats kept on the diet deficient in vitamin Be, spontaneous improvement of the skin lesion occurred but the rats became, at the same time, progressively anemic, exhibiting the typical picture of panmyelophthisis with all its manifestations [...] agranulocytosis and hemorrhagic diathesis in addition to the anemia. In these rats the concurrence of deficiency diseases ended in favor of a disease which usually is relegated to a latent position. In view of this conception it was logical to expect to find, as was actually the case, panmyelophthisis present in the majority of the animals after the specific Be deficiency disease had been successfully treated with purified Be preparations. Panmyelophthisis is not the only disease that might complicate experimental work on vitamin Be deficiency, owing {{to the fact that the}} ration used is deficient in several respects. During the past 2 years deaths have occurred in our stock of experimental rats kept on the diet devoid of Be. At first no explanation could be found...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveMercury {{poisoning}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} recent causes of mortality andmortality in children worldwide, particularly in industrial environments; mercuryis a poisonous metal, especially harmful to the nervous and immune systemsand the kidneys and can even be fatal. Elemental mercury is present inthermometers, barometer batteries, sphygmomanometers and latex paints. Inorganic mercury salts are found in antiseptics, pesticides, pigments andexplosives and are used as preservatives in medicine. Mercury was once usedto stop fever, and this worked because the immune system was so weakenedthat it could no longer sustain the attack for which the fever was created. Somemedical drugs still contain mercury chloride and mercurous chloride and certainforms of mercury are still used in some laxatives. Mercury toxicity of the nervous system causes anorexia, ataxia, lack of abilityto coordinate voluntary muscle movements, dementia, depression, dizziness,emotional instability, erethism (abnormal irritability in response to stimulation),incoordination, insomnia, irritability, loss of ability to speak, memory impairment,numbness, saresthesias (sensation of prickling, tingling or creeping on the skin),psychosis, tremors, drowsiness, fatigue and weakness. Other organ damages include kidney failure, headaches, hearing impairment,visual impairment, hypertension, dermatitis, digestive tract problems, colitis,diarrhea, stomatitis and excessive salivation, loss of teeth, metallic taste,chromosomal damage, birth defects and ensuing organ failure. Chronic mercurypoisoning can cause <b>Acrodynia</b> (Pink disease). Mercury poisoning is a rarecause of hypertension in children. Herein we report 3 cases, the first a childwith hypertensive encephalopathy due to severe mercury poisoning and histwo siblings with moderate symptoms.

40|$|THE SUGGESTION IN 1948 that mercury {{poisoning}} was {{the principal}} cause of pink disease (<b>acrodynia)</b> in children (Warkany and Hubbard, 1948; Fanconi and Botezn, 1948) resulted in the withdrawal from sale of all mercury containing teething powders in the United Kingdom.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about {{mechanisms}} of idiosyncratic sensitivity to the damaging effects of mercury (Hg); however, there is likely a genetic component. The aim {{of the present study was}} to search for genetic variation in genes thought to be involved in Hg metabolism and transport in a group of individuals identified as having elevated Hg sensitivity compared to a normal control group. Materials and Methods: Survivors of pink disease (PD; infantile <b>acrodynia)</b> are a population of clinically identifiable individuals who are Hg sensitive. In the present study, single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes thought to be involved in Hg transport and metabolism were compared across two groups: (i) PD survivors (n = 25); and (ii) age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 25). Results: Analyses revealed significant differences between groups in genotype frequencies for rs 662 in the gene encoding paraoxanase 1 (PON 1) and rs 1801131 in the gene encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).

40|$|Pink disease (infantile <b>acrodynia)</b> was {{especially}} {{prevalent in the}} first half of the 20 th century. Primarily attributed to exposure to mercury (Hg) commonly found in teething powders, the condition was developed by approximately 1 in 500 exposed children. The differential risk factor was identified as an idiosyncratic sensitivity to Hg. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have also been postulated to be produced by Hg. Analogous to the pink disease experience, Hg exposure is widespread yet only a fraction of exposed children develop an ASD, suggesting sensitivity to Hg may also be present in children with an ASD. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that individuals with a known hypersensitivity to Hg (pink disease survivors) may be more likely to have descendants with an ASD. Five hundred and twenty-two participants who had previously been diagnosed with pink disease completed a survey on the health outcomes of their descendants. The prevalence rates of ASD and a variety of other clinical conditions diagnosed in childhood (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, Fragile X syndrome, and Down syndrome) were compared to well-established general population prevalence rates. The results showed the prevalence rate of ASD among the grandchildren of pink disease survivors (1 in 25) to be significantly higher than the comparabl...|$|E
