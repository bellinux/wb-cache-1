5000|$|Oh, {{once upon}} a time in Arkansas,An old man sat in his little cabin doorAnd fiddled at a tune that he liked to hear,A jolly old tune that he played by ear.It was raining hard, but the fiddler didn't care,He sawed away at the popular air,Tho' his rooftree leaked like a waterfall,That didn't seem to bother the man at all.A {{traveler}} was riding by that day,And stopped to hear him a-practicing away;The cabin was <b>a-float</b> and his feet were wet,But still the old man didn't seem to fret.So the stranger said [...] "Now the way it seems to me,You'd better mend your roof," [...] said he.But the old man said as he played away,"I couldn't mend it now, it's a rainy day."The traveler replied, [...] "That's all quite true,But this, I think, is the thing to do;Get busy on a day that is fair and bright,Then patch the old roof till it's good and tight."But the old man kept on a-playing at his reel,And tapped the ground with his leathery heel."Get along," [...] said he, [...] "for you give me a pain;My cabin never leaks when it doesn't rain." ...|$|E

"She was a-visiting {{there at}} Booth's Landing, {{and just in}} {{the edge of the}} evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went <b>a-floating</b> down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple--and oh, he WAS the best cretur!--I most wish 't it had been me, I do." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt good}} and all washed clean of sin {{for the first}} time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn't do it {{straight}} off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we <b>a-floating</b> along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.|$|R
