Self-service is a very cost efficient way of delivering services since the retailer harnesses the customers labour power to carry out many of the retail tasks. However, many customers appreciate full service and are willing to pay a premium for the benefits of full-service.|$|E

In March 2013, TLC announced that What Not to Wear would air its final season starting in July. London said of the experience [...] "This show changed me and the trajectory of my life... I hope we touched [...] as much as they touched me. I hope we touched our viewers."

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this thesis {{is the notion that}} in order for organisations to understand what customers value and how customers experience service, they need to learn <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> The first and perhaps most important link in an organisation-wide learning process directed at customers is the frontline contact person. Service- and sales organisations can only learn <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> if the individual frontline contact persons learn <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> Even though it is commonly recognised that learning <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> is the basis for an organisation’s success, few contributions within marketing investigate the fundamental nature of the phenomenon as it occurs in everyday customer service. Thus, what learning <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> is and how it takes place in a customer-service setting is an issue that is neglected in marketing research. In order to explore these questions, this thesis presents a socio-cultural approach to understanding learning <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> Hence, instead of considering learning equal to cognitive processes {{in the mind of the}} frontline contact person or learning as equal to organisational information processing, the interactive, communication-based, socio-cultural aspect of learning <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> is brought to the fore. Consequently, the theoretical basis of the study can be found both in socio-cultural and practice-oriented lines of reasoning, as well as in the fields of service- and relationship marketing. As it is argued that learning <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> is an integrated part of everyday practices, it is also clear that it should be studied in a naturalistic and holistic way as it occurs in a customer-service setting. This calls for an ethnographic research approach, which involves direct, first-hand experience of the research setting during an extended period of time. Hence, the empirical study employs participant observations, informal discussions and interviews among car salespersons and service advisors at a car retailing company. Finally, as a synthesis of theoretically and empirically gained understanding, a set of concepts are developed and they are integrated into a socio-cultural model of learning <b>about</b> <b>customers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Knowledge sharing is an {{acknowledged}} pre-requisite {{for effective}} knowledge management. There is an extensive literature upon knowledge sharing practices and potential barriers. There is increasing {{recognition of the}} value of knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> within organisations. There are often several distinct avenues through which such knowledge is channelled. An assessment tool of knowledge flows is used to identify patterns in knowledge sharing for different facets of knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> within a case study organisation. An analysis is undertaken of sharing of knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> among customer service, sales and operations management teams, within the teams with peers, horizontally with other teams, and vertically within the organisation. The study demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} identify patterns of sharing knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> The research highlights the value of the approach towards analysing knowledge sharing in organisations generally. © 2011 Operational Research Society.

40|$|Product {{development}} {{is recognized as}} cross-functional, knowledge-intensive work that has become increasingly important in the fast-paced, globally competitive environment. Researchers and practicing managers contend that design engineers may {{play an important role}} in product development efforts. However, their effect on the product development process is not well understood and the extent of their impact on product development performance has not been adequately accessed. This research defines the changing role of design engineers, and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of design engineers, clarity of project targets, shared knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of design engineers expands the clarity of project targets increase. This increase impacts the extent of shared knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers.</b> Increases in the clarity of project targets and shared knowledge <b>about</b> <b>customers</b> appear to enhance product development productivity...|$|R
