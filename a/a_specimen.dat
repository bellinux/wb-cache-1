5|$|A. f. styani {{has been}} {{described}} by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> collected in Sichuan. Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.|$|E
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal are light yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the {{expedition}} left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{molecular}} studies, the preservation of <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> that can vouch {{for the source of}} the tissue sample used to gather genetic data has been recommended, as genetic analysis often yields surprising results that make reexamination of the original specimen crucial.|$|E
5|$|New {{specimens}} {{were not}} described {{for many years}} following {{the activity of the}} early 1900s.

5|$|Research on Iguanodon {{decreased}} {{during the}} early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the Great Depression enveloped Europe.

5|$|Surgeon-General to the First Fleet John White caught <b>a</b> <b>specimen</b> in May 1788, {{calling it}} a yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, which was {{published}} in 1790. Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler. John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848, which has become its official name.

5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used.
