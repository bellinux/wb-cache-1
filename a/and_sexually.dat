5|$|In the Netherlands, Hidjo {{stays with}} a local family and enjoys {{the beauty of the}} Netherlands. The family's daughter, Betje, finds him {{intriguing}} because of his ethnicity. Although Hidjo initially receives her coldly, the two later become romantically <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> involved. In Surakarta, Walter becomes attracted to Biroe and breaks off his engagement with Roos, who in turn aborts their child. This, and Biroe's rejection, leads him to return to the Netherlands, where he and Hidjo meet.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Kenny's speech is {{achieved}} by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more {{like that of a}} fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.|$|E
5|$|Traditional beliefs {{regarding}} {{slow lorises}} {{have been part}} of the folklore of Southeast Asia for at least several hundred years. Their remains are buried under houses and roads to bring good luck, and every part of their body is used in traditional medicine to make products ranging from love potions to unproven cures for cancer, leprosy, epilepsy, <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> transmitted diseases. The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives.|$|E

50|$|Pandeidae is {{a family}} of hydroids in the class Hydrozoa. Like other {{jellyfish}} there is usually a mature medusa form which is pelagic <b>and</b> reproduces <b>sexually</b> <b>and</b> a hydroid or polyp form which is often benthic and reproduces asexually by budding.|$|R
5|$|Wheeler is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} important British archaeologists of the twentieth century, responsible for successfully encouraging British public interest in the discipline and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording. Further, he is widely acclaimed as a major figure in the establishment of South Asian archaeology. However, many of his specific interpretations of archaeological sites have been discredited or reinterpreted, and he was often criticised for bullying colleagues <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> harassing young women.|$|E
5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual {{interpretations of}} Batman have {{continued}} into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> explicit poses. DC threatened both the artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action {{if they did not}} cease selling the works and demanded the surrender of all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them.|$|E

Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} recordings of vampire activity came from the region of Istria in modern Croatia, in 1672. Local reports cited the local vampire Giure Grando of the village Khring near Tinjan {{as the cause of}} panic among the villagers. A former peasant, Guire died in 1656; however, local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E

Angered, Loco attempts to shoot him, but he is stopped by Burnett, who arrests him for attempted murder and prepares {{to take him to}} a prison in Tonopah.

5|$|Presociality is when animals exhibit {{more than}} just sexual {{interactions}} {{with members of the}} same species, but fall short of qualifying as eusocial. That is, presocial animals can display communal living, cooperative care of young, or primitive division of reproductive labor, but they do not display all of the three essential traits of eusocial animals. Humans and some species of Callitrichidae (marmosets and tamarins) are unique among primates in their degree of cooperative care of young. Harry Harlow set up an experiment with rhesus monkeys, presocial primates, in 1958; the results from this study showed that social encounters are necessary in order for the young monkeys to develop both mentally <b>and</b> <b>sexually.</b>|$|E

5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E
5|$|The Platte Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a hostage taking and {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six female students hostage <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E

Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, <b>and</b> <b>sexually</b> transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal.
