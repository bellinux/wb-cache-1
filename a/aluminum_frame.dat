5|$|The HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android {{smartphone}} designed, developed, {{and manufactured}} by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC’s seventh flagship smartphone. It is {{the successor to}} the company’s 2012 flagship model, the One X—which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful {{due in part to}} insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame,</b> a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC’s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed—an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device’s power button.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice}} of {{material}} was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
25|$|On August 3, 2013, Polaris {{announced}} three all-new Indian-branded motorcycles {{based on}} the traditional styling of the Indian marque, along with the Thunder Stroke 111 V-twin engine. The motor has a triple-cam design with a chain-driven center cam turning front and rear cams via gears, permitting parallel placement of the pushrods to give a similar appearance to older Indian designs. It is air cooled, with large traditional fins and an airbox in the cast <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame.</b> All Indians using the Thunder Stroke 111 engine share this <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> design, though the wheelbase and front end rake vary depending on model. The integrated transmission is also gear-driven.|$|E
50|$|The first frames were {{available}} in two colors, red and white, and painted with DuPont Imron paint. Cannondale achieved the distinction of becoming the first high-volume producer of <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames.</b> Previously only steel frames were mass-produced, while <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames</b> were handmade in low volumes.|$|R

25|$|ULDs {{come in two}} forms: pallets and containers. ULD pallets are rugged {{sheets of}} {{aluminum}} with rims designed to lock onto cargo net lugs. ULD containers, also known as cans and pods, are closed containers made of aluminum or combination of <b>aluminum</b> (<b>frame)</b> and Lexan (walls), which, depending {{on the nature of}} the goods to be transported, may have built-in refrigeration units. Examples of common ULDs and their specifics are listed below.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, a {{back porch}} {{was added to}} the home and a garage was built on the {{northwest}} corner of the lot. A year later, the new owners added a second bedroom to the northwest corner of the house. With that addition, today’s historic structure was complete. Subsequent alterations changed some of the original characteristics. For example, in the 1970s, the original double-hung windows were replaced by <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> windows. The original doors were also replaced during that period.|$|E
25|$|Ergonomic and {{cosmetic}} {{changes for the}} 2008 model include a higher windscreen, and interlocking gauge faces with a digital speedometer, {{as well as a}} new gear indicator and adjustable shift light. The fairing fasteners were hidden to uncomplicate custom paint work. The twin-spar <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> was carried over from the previous version, and wheelbase, rake/trail, and seat height were the same, while overall length grew by two inches, and the taller windscreen added about ½inch. Weight was saved by omitting the centerstand.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{attention to}} energy saving in buildings {{has led to}} more accurate analysis of the thermal performance of windows. In particular, the use of <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames</b> has known a rapid development; thanks to the installation of thermal break systems, the performance of <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames</b> is nowadays comparable to the one wooden frames. The numerous air cavities inside <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames</b> suggest a deep investigation of the heat exchange process; the paper, therefore, analyzes {{the effect of the}} geometric and surface characteristics of the cavities on the overall performance of the profile. The attention was focused on the emissivity properties of the cavity inner surfaces, since they play a fundamental role on radiation heat transfer; furthermore, the frame thermal performance was evaluated when the geometries of some cavities are changed with the insertion of rubber gaskets. All the analysis were conducted with two different approaches: numerical and experimental, obtaining a good match between the methods; the validation of the CFD model makes it a quick and user-friendly tool for the preliminary design and optimization of <b>aluminum</b> window <b>frames</b> with a high thermal resistance...|$|R
40|$|A major {{objective}} of the U. S. Department of Energy {{is to have a}} zero energy commercial building by the year 2025. Windows have a major influence on the energy performance of the building envelope as they control over 55 % of building energy load, and represent one important area where technologies can be developed to save energy. <b>Aluminum</b> <b>framing</b> systems are used in over 80 % of commercial fenestration products (i. e. windows, curtain walls, store fronts, etc.). <b>Aluminum</b> <b>framing</b> systems are often required in commercial buildings because of their inherent good structural properties and long service life, which is required from commercial and architectural frames. At the same time, they are lightweight and durable, requiring very little maintenance, and offer design flexibility. An additional benefit of <b>aluminum</b> <b>framing</b> systems is their relatively low cost and easy manufacturability. Aluminum, being an easily recyclable material, also offers sustainable features. However, from energy efficiency point of view, <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames</b> have lower thermal performance due to the very high thermal conductivity of aluminum. Fenestration systems constructed of aluminum alloys therefore have lower performance in terms of being effective barrier to energy transfer (heat loss or gain). Despite the lower energy performance, aluminum is the choice material for commercial framing systems and dominates the commercial/architectural fenestration market because of the reasons mentioned above. In addition, there is no other cost effective and energy efficient replacement material available to take place of aluminum in the commercial/architectural market. Hence it is imperative to improve the performance of <b>aluminum</b> <b>framing</b> system to improve the energy performance of commercial fenestration system and in turn reduce the energy consumption of commercial building and achieve zero energy building by 2025. The {{objective of}} this project was to develop high performance, energy efficient commercial fenestration framing systems, by investigating new technologies that would improve the thermal performance of <b>aluminum</b> <b>frames,</b> while maintaining their structural and life-cycle performance. The project targeted an improvement of over 30 % (whole window performance) over conventional commercial framing technology by improving the performance of commercial framing systems...|$|R
25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame.</b> It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{original}} LF-A concept, development time was lengthened by {{the switch from}} an <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> to a carbon fibre tub, the result of engineering efforts aimed at improving the LF-A's power-to-weight ratio. The LF-A was reported to draw engineering resources from Toyota's Formula One team. In January 2007, a restyled LF-A concept car premiered alongside the first production F marque vehicle, the IS F sports sedan. The second LF-A concept featured a more aerodynamic exterior, a near-production interior, and F marque emblems. Later that year, Lexus GB director Steve Settle indicated plans for a V10 and hybrid version of the LF-A. The hybrid version, combining a petrol engine with electric motors, would likely feature a V8 powertrain similar to that designed for the Lexus LS 600h L. LF-A test mules continued to be spotted at the Nürburgring, including early models with a large, fixed rear wing. In December 2007, Auto Express reported that the LF-A had set an unofficial 7:24 lap record at the Nürburgring.|$|E

500|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame, which weigh about [...] each. Their one-piece <b>aluminum</b> <b>frame</b> and handlebars conceal {{cables and}} fasteners {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with a Shimano Nexus three-speed, twist-shifter-operated internal geared hub, full mudguards/fenders and chainguard. The heavy-duty tires are puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. The tires are also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame, whose bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec, region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan.
