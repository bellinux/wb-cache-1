5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> {{the assumption that}} hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E

In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers.

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|In his 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, the {{freelance}} dinosaurologist Gregory Paul {{proposed that}} A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build {{compared to a}} postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an illium, and ankle and foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species was followed in some semi-technical and popular works, the 2000 thesis on Allosauridae noted that Charles Gilmore mistakenly reconstructed USNM 4734 as having a shorter skull than the specimens referred by Paul to atrox, refuting supposed differences between USNM 4734 and putative A. atrox specimens like DINO 2560, AMNH 600, and AMNH 666.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.|$|E
