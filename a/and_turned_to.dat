He remained active in the world of business and as a military commentator, before dying at the age of 75.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a well-defined structure as it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat low and an approaching cold front.|$|E

He spent {{three to four}} years in various locations, before settling in Boston, Massachusetts. On 12 August 1714, he married Eliza Marble at the First Church of Boston. They had a son, who died when he was an infant, and then a daughter named Elizabeth, born in the winter of 1719.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{moving over}} warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened. Elida fell to {{a tropical storm}} on July 27, then degenerated into a remnant low <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. The remnant dissipated over the open ocean about 535mi (861km) west of Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|That year, {{relations}} with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled Israeli military advisers <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and the Soviet Union for support. Amin became {{an outspoken critic}} of Israel. In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin. In the 1974 French-produced documentary film , Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers, and suicide squadrons.|$|E
5|$|A {{depression}} {{formed on}} October 18 {{in the central}} Bay of Bengal {{and moved to the}} north. It gradually intensified <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, becoming a cyclonic storm on October 20. The storm became the second severe cyclonic storm of the season the following day, and turned onto a more northerly track towards the Ganges Delta. The storm peaked with winds of 130km/h (80mph) before it made landfall near the West Bengal-East Pakistan border during the morning of October 23. The storm then crossed over East Pakistan, before dissipating over southern Assam on October 24.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Chapala {{skirted the}} Yemeni island of Socotra on 1November. Drier air and {{increased}} wind shear weakened the cyclone, although it maintained {{much of its}} intensity upon entering the Gulf of Aden on 2November, becoming the strongest known cyclone in that body of water. After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E

Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français. She was very proud of these achievements, listing them on the title pages of her books.|$|E
5|$|An {{unstable}} area {{developed a}} circulation {{and became a}} tropical depression on July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm on July 7. The next day, it was a hurricane <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the west. Continuing to strengthen, it reached Category4 intensity on July 9. This windspeed was the highest of the season. The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm on July 13. It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter. Denise brought winds of near-gale force to parts of Mexico, but otherwise caused no damage or casualties.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it {{was considered to be}} {{only a matter of time}} before they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe did not want to see the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

Shortly after, the JTWC assessed Nancy to have peaked with winds of 230km/h (145mph 1-minute winds). Increasing forward motion {{to the southeast}} and increasing wind shear caused Nancy to weaken. Early on February15, the storm passed directly over Manuae. Continued weakening took place as a trough approached from the southwest. By February16, Nancy weakened below hurricane intensity <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the southwest as it began to undergo a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Olaf to the north.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{violence}} {{had broken}} out between the two sides; {{less than three months}} after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E

5|$|Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> selling {{underwater}} electrical detonators and waterproof cable {{of his own}} invention. Soon {{after the}} failure of the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company, he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds. Colt's waterproof cable, made from tar-coated copper, proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes, rivers, bays, and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean. Morse used the battery from one of Colt's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal.|$|E
5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders.

Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carrie was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1957 Atlantic hurricane season. The third named storm and second hurricane of the year, Carrie formed from an easterly tropical wave off the western coast of Africa on September2, a type of tropical cyclogenesis typical of Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Moving to the west, the storm gradually intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September5. Carrie intensified further, before reaching peak intensity on September8 as a Category 4hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) in the open Atlantic Ocean. The hurricane curved northwards and fluctuated in intensity as it neared Bermuda on September14. However, Carrie passed well north of the island <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the northeast towards Europe. Weakening as it reached higher latitudes, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September23, prior to affecting areas of the British Isles.|$|E
