25|$|<b>Apricot</b> <b>Jam</b> and Other Stories (2010) by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In a {{short story}} about Marshal Georgii Zhukov's futile {{attempts}} at writing his memoirs, the retired Marshal reminisces about serving against the peasant uprising in Tambov province. He recalls Mikhail Tukhachevsky's arrival to take command of the campaign and his first address to his men. He announced that total war and scorched earth tactics are to be used against civilians who assist or even sympathize with the peasant rebels. Zhukov proudly recalls how Tukhachevsky's tactics were adopted and succeeded in breaking the uprising. In the process, however, they virtually depopulated the surrounding countryside.|$|E
50|$|A {{particular}} {{variety of}} this confection, known primarily by various regional names listed below, is {{with layers of}} brightly colored, almond-based sponge cake, <b>apricot</b> and/or raspberry <b>jam,</b> and a chocolate coating. Many bakeries sell them by the pound, {{and because of the}} many layers, these cookies tend to be somewhat heavy estimating in about fifteen to a pound.|$|R
50|$|In Denmark, cookie {{butter is}} known as trøffel-masse and is used for many {{traditional}} confectionery cakes such as studenterbrød, romkugler (known as trøfler {{in some parts of}} the country) and træstammer (a bit similar to the Swedish dammsugare) on sale in most bakeries. The cookie butter is mostly flavoured with cocoa and often includes other types of crumbled cakes. It is sometimes mixed with shredded coconut, rolled oats and/or jams. For the <b>jam,</b> <b>apricot</b> or raspberry is the preferred ingredient.|$|R
5000|$|Doughnuts {{similar to}} the Berliner are {{prepared}} in the northern Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia and Serbia (pokladnice or krofne). They are also called krofna, krafna or krafne, a name derived from the Austrian Krapfen for this pastry. In Croatia, they are especially popular during Carneval season {{and do not have}} the typical ring shape, but instead are solid. Traditionally, they are filled with <b>jam</b> (<b>apricot</b> or plum). However, they can be filled with vanilla or chocolate cream. Another types of doughnuts are uštipci and fritule.|$|R

40|$|Strobilurins are {{a family}} of {{synthetic}} natural-derived pesticides widely used for fungi control in many crops. As {{part of a larger}} research project, a collection of monoclonal antibodies {{to one of the most}} relevant strobilurins, i. e. pyraclostrobin, has been generated using functionalized haptens with the spacer arm located at different sites. The toxophore aliphatic moiety, as observed with other strobilurins, and the planar aromatic two-ring system characteristic of this molecule were revealed as the best tethering sites for high-affinity monoclonal antibody production. A central derivatization position did not generate a good immune response, but such derivatives were useful as heterologous competitors in order to improve assay sensitivity. Direct and indirect assays were characterized in terms of solvent influence, pH, and ionic strength. Immunoassays with limits of detection below 0. 1 Î¿g/L were developed. A QuEChERS-based procedure was applied to the extraction of blueberry, strawberry, raspberry, peach, <b>apricot,</b> and plum <b>jams.</b> Clean acetonitrile extracts were properly diluted in water and analyzed by both optimized immunoassays with good accuracy and precision at levels covering the European maximum residue limits for those fruits.

5000|$|In his drawings, prints, and {{paintings}} throughout the 1970s, Ruscha experimented {{with a range}} of materials including gunpowder, vinyl, blood, red wine, fruit and vegetable juices, axle grease, chocolate syrup, tomato paste, bolognese sauce, cherry pie, coffee, caviar, daffodils, tulips, raw eggs and grass stains. Stains, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in edible substances such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like A Blvd. Called Sunset (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colourings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio Insects (1972) consists of six screen prints - three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine’s title in a salad of squashed foods. Ruscha's Fruit Metrecal Hollywood (1971) {{is an example of the}} artist's use of unusual materials, this silkscreen of the [...] "Hollywood" [...] sign is rendered in <b>apricot</b> and grape <b>jam</b> and the diet drink Metrecal on paper.|$|R

For being now in the open sea a slight breeze had sprung up, which cheered her {{as well as her}} two younger companions. But {{unfortunately}} it had a reverse effect upon the vicar, who, after turning a sort of <b>apricot</b> <b>jam</b> colour, interspersed with dashes of raspberry, pleaded indisposition, and vanished from their sight.|$|E
60|$|Sunday morning found Anna in a {{different}} frame of mind {{from that of the}} evening before. Uncle Clement had been very ill all night, and the house was to be kept as quiet as possible. When Anna came in from early Celebration, Aunt Cherry came out looking like a ghost, and very anxious, and gave a sigh of relief on Adrian being reported still sound asleep. Gerald presently came down, pale and languid, but calling himself all right, and loitering over his breakfast till after the boy appeared, so rosy and ravenous as to cause no apprehension, except that he should devour too much <b>apricot</b> <b>jam,</b> and use his new boots too noisily on the stairs.|$|E
60|$|The dinner passed off well enough. Mr. Gibson, at {{the head}} of the table, did, indeed, look very much out of his element, as though he {{conceived}} that his position revealed to the outer world those ideas of his in regard to Dorothy, which ought to have been secret for a while longer. There are few men who do not feel ashamed of being paraded before the world as acknowledged suitors, whereas ladies accept the position with something almost of triumph. The lady perhaps regards herself as the successful angler, whereas the gentleman is conscious of some similitude to the unsuccessful fish. Mr. Gibson, though he was not yet gasping in the basket, had some presentiment of this feeling, which made his present seat of honour unpleasant to him. Brooke Burgess, at the other end of the table, was as gay as a lark. Mrs. MacHugh sat on one side of him, and Miss Stanbury on the other, and he laughed at the two old ladies, reminding them of his former doings in Exeter,--how he had hunted Mrs. MacHugh's cat, and had stolen Aunt Stanbury's best <b>apricot</b> <b>jam,</b> till everybody began to perceive that he was quite a success. Even Sir Peter Mancrudy laughed at his jokes, and Mrs. Powel, from the other side of Sir Peter, stretched her head forward so that she might become one of the gay party.|$|E
6000|$|A {{pleasant}} room {{it was as}} {{any party}} need desire to muster in on a cold November evening. The fireplace alone was a picture: a wide and deep recess with a low brick altar in the middle, where great logs of dry wood sent myriad sparks up the dark chimney-throat; and over the front of this recess a large wooden entablature bearing this motto, finely carved in old English letters, 'Fear God and honour the King'. And beyond the party, who formed a half-moon with their chairs and well-furnished table round this bright fireplace, what a space of chiaroscuro for the imagination to revel in! Stretching across {{the far end of}} the room, what an oak table, high enough surely for Homer's gods, standing on four massive legs, bossed and bulging like sculptured urns! and, lining the distant wall, what vast cupboards, suggestive of inexhaustible <b>apricot</b> <b>jam</b> and promiscuous butler's perquisites! A stray picture or two had found their way down there, and made agreeable patches of dark brown on the buff-coloured walls. High over the loud-resounding double door hung one which, from some indications of a face looming out of blackness, might, by a great synthetic effort, be pronounced a Magdalen. Considerably lower down hung the similitude of a hat and feathers, with portions of a ruff, stated by Mrs. Bellamy to represent Sir Francis Bacon, who invented gunpowder, and, in her opinion, 'might ha' been better emplyed.' ...|$|E
