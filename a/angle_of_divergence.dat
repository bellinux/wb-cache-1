Many specimens have a pointed or rounded apex. Leaf base is extended. Leaf texture is leathery, tough, but also pliable. Midribs are medium becoming less visible close to the apex. Secondary veins are thin, generally indistinct; Veins: often 6 to 10 pairs, indifferently opposite, subopposite, and alternate, camptodrome. Venation branches from the midrib at different angles, which may vary from 12° to 70°. The basal veins are very ascending in some plants: the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>divergence</b> may be close to 45°. The basal secondary venation branches from a point near the base of the main vein and becomes parallel with the leaf margin, with the distance of 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters from the edges.

The flowers are yellow to orange-red and produced in panicles about 2.5 cm in length. The flowers may be only male or female ones, and one plant bears either male or female flowers. However, sometimes they are observed to bear flowers of both sexes. The pollen is transported by anemophily.

While divergence hugely destabilises, slip dramatically stabilizes the linear mode.

60|$|It is so {{necessary}} {{to appreciate the}} important effects {{of the laws of}} growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain fir-trees, the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the leaves differ, according to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous. In many Compositae and Umbelliferae (and in some other plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact, previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other characters. In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields achenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferae the exterior seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance. Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in {{the lower part of the}} spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the same manner.|$|R

The battery thermal management system (BTMS) is critical to remove the heat generated by the battery pack, which guarantees the appropriate working temperature for the battery pack. Air cooling {{is one of the}} most commonly-used solutions among various battery thermal management technologies. In this paper, the cooling performance of the parallel air-cooled BTMS is improved through choosing appropriate system parameters. The flow field and the temperature field of the system are calculated using the computational fluid dynamics method. Typical numerical cases are introduced to study the influences of the operation parameters and the structure parameters on the performance of the BTMS. The operation parameters include the discharge rate of the battery pack, the inlet air temperature and the inlet airflow rate. The structure parameters include the cell spacing and the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>divergence</b> plenum and the convergence plenum. The results show that the temperature rise and the temperature difference of the batter pack are not affected by the inlet air flow temperature and are increased as the discharge rate increases. Increasing the inlet airflow rate can reduce the maximum temperature, but meanwhile significantly increase the power consumption for driving the airflow. Adopting smaller cell spacing can reduce the temperature and the temperature difference of the battery pack, but it consumes much more power. Designing the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the <b>divergence</b> plenum and the convergence plenum is an effective way to improve the performance of the BTMS without occupying more system volume.

40|$|Convergent-divergent nozzles, when run at {{off-design}} conditions, often undergo flow resonance {{accompanied by}} the emission of a tone. Apart from screech occurring at higher operating pressures, resonance is also common at lower Mach numbers near transonic as well as subsonic conditions. With data from six nozzles of different size and design Mach number, the present paper documents {{the characteristics of the}} latter phenomenon that is morphologically quite different from conventional screech. The resonance is due to a feedback loop internal to the nozzle and is apparently driven by unsteady laminar boundary layer separation near the throat of the nozzle. Appropriate boundary layer tripping prior to the throat is found to eliminate or alter most of the tones. The Helmholtz number of the resonance, based on the throat-to-exit length, is found to attain a value of approximately 0. 15 at M(sub j) = 1 for all nozzles. However, its variation with M(sub j) may be different and depend on the nozzle geometry. With nozzles having larger throat-to-exit <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>divergence,</b> the frequency is found to increase, in some cases having stage jumps to lower frequencies, with increasing operating pressure. With nozzles having smaller <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>divergence,</b> the frequency variation exhibits an increase followed by a decrease involving one prominent stage occurring around transonic (M(sub j) = 1) condition.

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, diode lasers have {{established}} {{in a number of}} fields of application in research and industry. Such light sources feature a high degree of efficiency as well as a long duration of life. Thanks to steady further developments, modern diode lasers exhibit an output power in the range of some watts and have become a cost-efficient alternative solution for other types of lasers. In addition, diodes are suitable sources for pumping solid state lasers. However, due to the functional principle and the setup, diode lasers exhibit an elliptical beam profile, resulting in a limited focusability. In addition, both the short and the long axis of diode lasers propagate at different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>divergence.</b> As a consequence, astigmatism can occur. In order to overcome these disadvantages, several techniques for shaping diode laser beams are in hand. For example, anamorphic lenses, consisting of an assembly of cylindrical lenses or gradient-index elements, can be used for shaping a circular beam profile. For this purpose, anamorphic micro-lenses can be applied moreover. Further, anamorphic prisms or prism pairs allow converting circular laser beams from elliptical diode laser irradiation. Such a shaping is also achieved by combinations of aspheric, cylindric and toric micro-lenses and macroscopic lenses. Other techniques for generating circular beam profiles are based on micro-optical elements such as crossed micro step-mirrors in order to shape the short and the long axis successively. This method can be used for fibre-coupling applications. In addition, micro-mirrors are used to assemble beam-shaping devices where the functional principle is comparable to imaging micro-lens beam homogenisers. The incoming beam is divided into a number of partial beams by a series of tilted plane micro-mirrors. Subsequently, the partial beams are recomposed by a micro-mirror recombiner. A similar technique is based on a stepped mirror. Here, only the short axis is divided in subunits, leading to a rectangular beam profile after further reflection. This rectangular beam profile is then shaped by macroscopic lenses. Instead of micro-mirrors, diffractive optical elements or arrays of right-angled prisms can be used furthermore for shaping diode laser beams. Beam shaping can also be achieved using two offset plane mirrors. Due to its simple design, this technique presents a costefficient solution...|$|R
