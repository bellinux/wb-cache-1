5|$|Social wasps are {{considered}} pests {{when they become}} excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods {{and are more likely}} to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{workers are}} gamergates, meaning they can {{reproduce}} with winged males. With workers {{taking over the}} reproductive role, queens are relatively insignificant and are rarely produced in colonies. Nuptial flight begins in spring, with males mating {{with one or two}} females. Queens that establish their own colonies are semi-claustral, going out and forage to support their young. Another way colonies are formed is through budding, where a subset of the colony leaves the main colony for an alternative nest site. The green-head ant is known for its painful and venomous sting that can cause <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shock</b> in sensitive humans. However, they can also be beneficial to humans, acting as a form of pest control by preying on agricultural pests such as beetles, moths and termites.|$|E

The Tanox' anti-IgE antibodies were designed to target free IgE in blood and IgE-expressing B lymphocytes {{for the purpose of}} intercepting the IgE-mediated pathway, without binding to IgE already bound by the high affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils or bound by the low-affinity IgE receptors on many cell types. An ordinary anti-IgE antibody, if were injected into a patient, would cause a massive activation of mast cells and basophils and hence <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shocks.</b> By 1989, Tanox had collected data showing that their proposed therapeutic lead anti-IgE antibody could not induce the activation of basophils isolated from the blood of any {{of a large number of}} extremely allergic individuals, even under the most permissive conditions.|$|R
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shock,</b> adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shock.</b> In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western honeybee and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|The green-head ant {{possesses}} a highly potent sting {{that can be}} painful but is short-lived. An icepack or commercially available spray {{can be used to}} relieve the pain, but individuals experiencing an allergic reaction are normally taken to the hospital for treatment. The venom is powerful enough to cause <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shock</b> in sensitive humans. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, of which the objective was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 34 participants reacted to the venom of the green-head ant. The rest of the participants reacted to Myrmecia venom, in particular, 176 to M. pilosula alone. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. The green-head ant was the only ant that was not a Myrmecia species to cause allergic reactions in participating individuals. Green-head ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Despite its potential danger to sensitive humans, green-head ants can be beneficial. They can serve as a form of pest control by killing agricultural pests such as beetle and moth larvae and termites.|$|E
50|$|TNX-901 is a humanized anti-IgE {{antibody}} with {{a unique}} set of binding specificity to human IgE. The therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies, like TNX-901, were designed to neutralize free IgE in the blood and in interstitial space and to target IgE-expressing B lymphocytes via their surface B cell receptors, without triggering the activation of mast cells and basophils, which bear on their surface high affinity IgE receptors, which are essentially fully occupied and armed by IgE. If an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, which does not possess the unique set of binding specificity of CGP51901 or TNX-901, were injected into a human subject, it would probably invariably induce an extensive scale of mast cell and basophil activation and hence the development of <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shocks.</b> TNX-901 can intervene with the IgE-mediated allergic pathway {{at the top of the}} pathway, and hence prevent the down-stream release of pharmacological mediators from activated basophils and mast cells. It was also discovered in the early clinical trials that the depletion of IgE in the blood gradually cause the down-regulation of the high-affinity IgE receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells, rendering these cells insensitive to allergen activation.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, {{after several}} rounds of pre-IND ("investigational new drug") {{meetings}} with officials/scientists of the FDA, the FDA finally gave a nod for CGP51901 {{to be tested}} in human subjects. This approval of IND for an anti-IgE antibody {{for the first time}} was regarded a brave demonstration of professionalism for both the FDA officials and the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team. The scientists participating in the pre-IND discussion comprehended that an ordinary anti-IgE antibody (i.e., one without the set of binding specificity of CGP51901) would invariably activate mast cells and basophils and cause <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shocks</b> and probably deaths among injected persons. Notwithstanding this concern, they came to the same view that based on the presented scientific data, CGP51901 should have an absolutely required clean distinction from an ordinary anti-IgE antibody in this regard. In 1991-1993, researchers from Ciba-Geigy and Tanox and a leading clinical research group (headed by Stephen Holgate) in the asthma/allergy field ran a successful Phase I human clinical trial of CGP51901 in Southampton, England and showed that the tested antibody is safe. In 1994-1995, the Tanox/Ciba-Geigy team conducted a Phase II trial of CGP51901 in patients with severe allergic rhinitis in Texas and showed that CGP51901 is safe and efficacious in relieving allergic symptoms.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Administration of {{meropenem}} to penicillin-allergic {{patients who}} {{might benefit from}} this treatment is usually avoided because of a 47. 4 % rate of cross-reactivity to imipenem, the prototype of the carbapenem class of beta-lactam antibiotics, demonstrated in a single study {{on the basis of}} positive responses to skin tests with imipenem reagents. However, recent studies of ours have demonstrated a very low rate of cross-reactivity between penicillins and both meropenem and imipenem in adults. OBJECTIVE: To assess cross-reactivity and tolerability of meropenem in children with documented penicillin allergy. METHODS: One hundred and eight consecutive children who had suffered a total of 129 immediate reactions (120 urticarial and/or angioedematous manifestations and 9 <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shocks)</b> to penicillins and had positive results to skin tests for {{at least one of the}} penicillin reagents tested underwent skin tests with meropenem and negative subjects were challenged with it. RESULTS: One subject (0. 9 %) displayed a positive intradermal test to meropenem. The remaining 107 subjects with negative skin tests to meropenem tolerated challenges. Challenges were not followed by full therapeutic courses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a low rate of cross-reactivity between penicillins and meropenem. Therefore, the practice of avoiding meropenem in children with immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity could be abandoned; in those who especially require meropenem treatment, prophylactic skin tests are advisable, because negative results indicate tolerability...|$|R

40|$|Surveillance of {{productivity}} and diseasesin the farm under study for economic viability indicated that brucellosis {{was the cause}} of losses in production and consequently effects on farming economy and human health, the high incidence of abortion led to development of resistance against further abortions, and as a result infected animals looked apparently normal. This perhaps, was a reason for the infection going unnoticed till its effects on production were detected. Although lack of proper reporting and observation by the keeper staff contributed heavily to the spread of infection in the flock. The major reason seems to be the slackness {{on the part of the}} management. Study to evolve a more realistic approach towards the treatment and control of brucellosis in sheep under field conditions, with a greater emphasison the cost of treatment in relation to the market value of the animal, indicated that the actual cost of treatment amounts to 14. 5 % of its market value. Use of patents from countries like India that make available good quality drugs at the lowest possible prices, did reduce the overall cost significantly. The cost of treatment is negligible compared to the beneficial effects of the treatment; as such, the cost of treatment cannot be viewed as an obstacle in the control of the disease. This trial has, for the first time thrown a deeper insight on the extent of losses a farmer would incur, should he opt to skip off the treatment. Realistic estimates of losses as a consequence of disposing the infected animal without treatment would include the reduced sale price, earlyreplacement cost (difference between the actual market value and the reduced saleprice), cost of the investigations and the cost of feeding till the date of disposal. Such an estimate showed that the losses on this account exceeded the actualmarket value of the animal itself. Further, the losses in production are bound to crop up unless replacement is effected early. This is an enormous loss to the farmer individually and for the country as a whole. The damaging effects of brucellosis on the economy of 6 farming and the health hazards to humanscan only be prevented by application of proper control measures including surveillance, testing and massive immunization of animals and most importantly the treatment of the infected ones. (Saleh et al 1994) Screening of 6000 sheep of Naimi breed – a local breed of Saudi Arabia, revealed a high seroprevalence of 33. 4 % ofthe mature stock[. The flock had to be screened for six times to filter all the infected sheep. The interval between the tests in one of the earlier trials was three months (Radwan etal 1995) at which rate the total duration for screening of a flock of 6000 would be 540 days – a time long enough to exhaust the patience of the farmer and permit a long exposure of the uninfected lot of the flock to infection, in addition, it would cost heavily for feeding and management of as many as 1500 infected animals. that would be an enormous burden and loss to the farmer. However, in another trial the interval has been reduced to 30 days. (Radwan etal 1995) Whereas, during the course of this investigation it was seen that the results were variable even when the interval between the sampling was as short as two minutes…This, indicates that there is no need to allow an interval as long as three months or even one month. The interval between the tests in this trial was therefore reduced to ten days, which enabled completion of the whole investigation in a matter of 60 days. This has minimized to a great extentthe risk of exposure to the brucellae free animals to infection. All the 1500 young lambs between 3 to 6 months of age tested negative, although they were born to infected mothers and sucked infected milk, showing that the vertical transmission of the disease was either absent or the lambs had passive immunity through colostrums. Oxytetracycline combined with Streptomycin by injection together with intra mammary infusions to the milking ones given over an extended period of 46 days 7 resulted in a cure rate of 100 % as evidentfrom the results of the serological and cultural investigations carried out at random Comparison of the antibody titre of the treated sheep and the controls determined periodically showed that there was a gradual decline in the titre in case of treated sheep whereas persistent levels wereshown in the untreated controls. Applying strict hygiene using single use sterile disposable syringes for the administration of the antimicrobial agents, lead to cmplete elimination of subcutaneous abscesses, <b>anaphylactic</b> <b>shocks</b> and irritability encountered in earlier trials. Weight gains, reduced mortality and improved conception rate observed in treated animals is, perhaps, due to action of the therapeutic agents employed in the regimen of treatment on sensetive organism other than brucllae rsposible for sub-clinical infection...|$|R
