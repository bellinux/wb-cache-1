5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Treaty of Pereyaslav, the Ottomans (supposedly acting on behalf of the Russian regent Sophia Alekseyevna) pressured the Patriarch of Constantinople into transferring the Metropoly of Kiev from the jurisdiction of Constantinople to that of Moscow. The controversial transfer brought millions of faithful <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> dioceses under the pastoral and administrative care of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', leading to the significant Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continued well into the 18th century, with Theophanes Prokopovich, Epiphanius Slavinetsky, Stephen Yavorsky and Demetrius of Rostov being among the most notable representatives of this trend.|$|E

25|$|Greig had {{his first}} epileptic fit {{at the age of}} 14, during a tennis match. Successfully {{controlling}} the condition with medication and self-management, largely by sleeping as and when he could during Test Matches, few knew about it for much of his playing career. He was often forewarned by auras. In 1971–72, he collapsed on the field during his first match for Eastern Province <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> teammates were required to hold down his large frame. The incident was explained away as heat stroke thanks to sympathetic media and team management. Returning from the tour of Australia in 1975, Greig had another epileptic fit at Heathrow Airport. His affliction became public during the Packer furore, when a number of commentators questioned his judgement in the matter and speculated that epilepsy impaired his ability to make decisions.|$|E
500|$|Brian Clough {{was not at}} Leeds much longer, being sacked on 12 September {{less than}} eight weeks after he arrived. In later years, he {{reflected}} on the 1974 Charity Shield and said: [...] "Billy Bremner's behaviour was scandalous, producing {{one of the most}} notorious incidents in Wembley history". Actually, as the Leeds website says, it was probably [...] "six of one <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> of the other", and Clough's [...] "one-eyed version of events" [...] was coloured by his nightmare experience at the club.|$|E
500|$|The western {{facade of}} the house was altered during the 20th century to {{compensate}} for the demolition of large parts of the house in 1805. The house is now largely built around the wing that had been built for William Pitt. Pitt's wing contained a library for himself and a 'bird room' for his wife, away from their children's rooms. The house was designated Grade II* listed status on 1 June 1984.

In March 1994, he said [...] "the Department of Transport's pig-headed approach to the M11 link road has been a shambles, and a costly one at that," [...] and described the ongoing police presence as [...] "a miniature equivalent of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait." [...] According to him, squatter Hugh Jones had been threatened by demolition men wielding sledgehammers and pickaxes, adding [...] "the project has cost £500,000 in police time alone, to take over and demolish a 250-year-old chestnut tree <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> houses" ...|$|E

There was no electricity, running water, or toilet. There were two pictures in the house; one of the Glorybound Singers (a Clarksdale-based Gospel group) and another of John F. Kennedy. Jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked, [...] "Is you really Mr. Bobby Kennedy?" [...] Kennedy smiled and shook his hand, replying, [...] "Yes.

500|$|Heinlein rapidly {{became one}} of the most {{prolific}} contributors to Astounding, publishing three novels in the next two years: If This Goes On—, Sixth Column, and Methuselah's Children; <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> short stories. [...] In September 1940, van Vogt's first novel, Slan, began serialization; the book was partly inspired by a challenge Campbell laid down to van Vogt that it was impossible to tell a superman story from the point of view of the superman. [...] It proved to be one of the most popular stories Campbell published, and is an example of the way Campbell worked with his writers to feed them ideas and generate the material he wanted to buy. [...] Isaac Asimov's [...] "Robot" [...] series began to take shape in 1941, with [...] "Reason" [...] and [...] "Liar!" [...] appearing in the April and May issues; as with [...] "Slan", these stories were partly inspired by conversations with Campbell. [...] The September 1941 issue included Asimov's short story [...] "Nightfall", probably the most famous U.S. science-fiction [...] story ever written, [...] and in November, Second Stage Lensman, the next novel in Smith's Lensman series, began serialization.|$|E
