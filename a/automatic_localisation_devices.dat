40|$|Abstract â Dynamic contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has become {{an important source of}} information to aid cancer diagnosis. Nevertheless, due to the multitemporal nature of the 3 D volume data obtained from DCE-MRI, evaluation of the image data is a challenging task and tools are required to support the human expert. We investigate an approach for <b>automatic</b> <b>localisation</b> and characterisation of suspicious lesions in DCE-MRI data. It applies an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture which combines unsupervised and supervised techniques for voxel-by-voxel classification of temporal kinetic signals. The algorithm is easy to implement, allows for fast training and application even for huge data sets and can be directly used to augment the display of DCE-MRI data. To demonstrate that the system provides a reasonable assessment of kinetic signals, the outcome is compared with the results obtained from the model-based three-time-points (3 TP) technique which represents a clinical standard protocol for analysing breast cancer lesions. The evaluation based on the DCE-MRI data of twelve cases indicates that, although the ANN is trained with imprecisely labelled data, the approach leads to an outcome conforming with 3 TP without presupposing an explicit model of the underlying physiological process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Computer {{vision has}} been widely used in the {{inspection}} of electronic components. This paper proposes a computer vision system for the <b>automatic</b> detection, <b>localisation,</b> and segmentation of solder joints on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) under different illumination conditions. Design/methodology/approach: An illumination normalization approach is applied to an image, which can effectively and efficiently eliminate the effect of uneven illumination while keeping {{the properties of the}} processed image the same as in the corresponding image under normal lighting conditions. Consequently special lighting and instrumental setup can be reduced in order to detect solder joints. These normalised images are insensitive to illumination variations and are used for the subsequent solder joint detection stages. In the segmentation approach, the PCB image is transformed from an RGB color space to a YIQ color space for the effective detection of solder joints from the background. Findings: The segmentation results show that the proposed approach improves the performance significantly for images under varying illumination conditions. Research limitations/implications: This paper proposes a front-end system for the <b>automatic</b> detection, <b>localisation,</b> and segmentation of solder joint defects. Further research is required to complete the full system including the classification of solder joint defects. Practical implications: The methodology presented in this paper can be an effective method to reduce cost and improve quality in production of PCBs in the manufacturing industry.

40|$|Identification of {{anatomical}} landmarks on skeletal tissue reconstructed from CT/MR {{images is}} indispensable in patient-specific preoperative planning (turnout referencing, deformity evaluation, resection planning, and implant alignment and anchoring) {{as well as}} intra-operative navigation (bone registration and instruments referencing). Interactive localisation of landmarks on patient-specific anatomical models is time-consuming and may lack in repeatability and accuracy. We present a computer graphics-based method for <b>automatic</b> <b>localisation</b> and identification (labelling) of anatomical landmarks on a 3 D model of bone reconstructed from CT images of a patient. The model surface is segmented into different landmark regions (peak, ridge, pit and ravine) based on surface curvature.

The methodology has been implemented in a software program and its results (automatically identified landmarks) are compared with those manually palpated by three experienced orthopaeclic surgeons, on three 3 D reconstructed bone models.

However, {{the analysis of}} aerial TIR images entails a number of difficulties which have thus far prevented monitoring tasks from being totally automated. One of these issues {{that needs to be}} addressed is the appearance of flame projections during the geo-correction of off-nadir images. Filtering these flames is essential in order to accurately estimate the geographical location of the fuel burning interface. Therefore, we present a methodology which allows the <b>automatic</b> <b>localisation</b> of the active fire contour free of flame projections. The actively burning area is detected in TIR georeferenced images through a combination of intensity thresholding techniques, morphological processing and active contours. Subsequently, flame projections are filtered out by the temporal frequency analysis of the appropriate contour descriptors. The proposed algorithm was tested on footages acquired during three large-scale field experimental burns. Results suggest this methodology may be suitable to automatise the acquisition of quantitative data about the fire evolution. As future work, a revision of the low-pass filter implemented for the temporal analysis (currently a median filter) was recommended. The availability of up-to-date information about the fire state would improve situational awareness during an emergency response and may be used to calibrate data-driven simulators capable of emitting short-term accurate forecasts of the subsequent fire evolution.

40|$|An MR-only {{radiotherapy}} planning (RTP) workflow {{would reduce}} the cost, radiation exposure and uncertainties introduced by CT-MRI registrations. In the case of prostate treatment, one of the remaining challenges currently holding back the implementation of an RTP workflow is the MR-based localisation of intraprostatic gold fiducial markers (FMs), which is crucial for accurate patient positioning. Â  Currently, MR-based FM localisation is clinically performed manually. This is sub-optimal, as manual interaction increases the workload. Attempts to perform automatic FM detection often rely {{on being able to}} detect signal voids induced by the FMs in magnitude images. However, signal voids may not always be sufficiently specific, hampering accurate and robust <b>automatic</b> FM <b>localisation.</b> Â  Here, we present an approach that aims at <b>automatic</b> MR-based FM <b>localisation.</b> This method is based on template matching using a library of simulated complex-valued templates, and exploiting the behaviour of the complex MR signal {{in the vicinity of the}} FM. Clinical evaluation was performed on seventeen prostate cancer patients undergoing external beam radiotherapy treatment. <b>Automatic</b> MR-based FM <b>localisation</b> was compared to manual MR-based and semi-automatic CT-based localisation (the current gold standard) in terms of detection rate and the spatial accuracy and precision of localisation. The proposed method correctly detected all three FMs in 15 / 17 patients. The spatial accuracy (mean) and precision (STD) were 0. 9 mm and 0. 5 mm respectively, which is below the voxel size of 1. 1 Ã 1. 1 Ã 1. 2 mm 3 and comparable to MR-based manual localisation. FM localisation failed (3 / 51 FMs) in the presence of bleeding or calcifications in the direct vicinity of the FM. Â  The method was found to be spatially accurate and precise, which is essential for clinical use. To overcome any missed detection, we envision the use of the proposed method along with verification by an observer. This will result in a semi-automatic workflow facilitating the introduction of an MR-only workflow...|$|R

Its performance is subject to change due to multipath propagation {{and changes in the}} environment (people, building layouts, antenna characteristics etc.) which cannot be easily eliminated. This thesis addresses the <b>automatic</b> <b>localisation</b> of indoor user and proposes solutions for both positioning and seamlessly tracking a user using WLAN technology in addition to image sensing. By fusing these modalities we obtain better performance than using them individually. A fusion function designed to merge both analysis results into one semantic interpretation of user location is presented. Also a tracking approach based on an adaptive function that converts times between locations into probabilities and employs a Viterbi-based solution is proposed. An indoor localisation algorithm is described which is based on the creation of a database of WLAN signal strengths at pre-chosen calibration points (CPs). The need for fewer CPs than in standard methods is achieved due to the use of a novel interpolation algorithm, based on the specification of robust range and angle-dependent likelihood functions that describe the probability of a user being in the vicinity of each CP. The actual location of the user is estimated by solving a system of equations with two unknowns derived for a pair of CPs. Different pairs of CPs can be chosen to make several estimates which can then be combined to increase the accuracy of the estimate. The effectiveness of the fusion and the tracking approaches is evaluated on a very challenging dataset throughout a university building. Results that are presented demonstrate high accuracy that can be achieved. The methods are compared to several competing localisation methods and are shown to give superior results. The potential usefulness of this work is envisaged in a range of ambient assisted living applications including lifelogging and as an assistive technology for the memory or the visually impaired...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>automatic</b> {{subcellular}} <b>localisation</b> {{of proteins}} in living cells {{is a critical}} step in determining their function. The evaluation of fluorescence images constitutes a common method of localising these proteins. For this, additional knowledge about {{the position of the}} con-sidered cells within an image is required. In an automated system, it is advantageous to recognise these cells in bright-field microscope images taken in parallel with the regarded fluorescence micrographs. Unfortu-nately, currently available cell recognition methods are only of limited use within the context of protein localisation, since they frequently re-quire microscopy techniques that enable images of higher contrast (e. g. phase contrast microscopy or additional dyes) or can only be employed with too low magnifications. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach to the robust automatic recognition of unstained living cells in bright-field microscope images.
