40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} {{to identify the}} relationship between tenure <b>security</b> <b>and</b> food <b>security.</b> The literatures on tenure issues <b>and</b> food <b>security</b> issues are not well connected and the scientific evidence on the causal links between tenure <b>security</b> <b>and</b> food <b>security</b> is very limited. The paper explores the conceptual linkages between land tenure reforms, tenure <b>security</b> <b>and</b> food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> illustrates how these vary across diverse contexts. The paper then reviews {{the limited number of}} high quality studies that contribute to a causal chain analysis between tenure <b>security</b> <b>and</b> food <b>security</b> <b>and</b> identifies important research gaps...|$|R

5|$|A small {{ministry}} of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) <b>and</b> <b>security</b> (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E
