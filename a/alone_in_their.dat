In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E
5|$|Ben aggressively pursues Clara. She finally asks Alan {{what his}} {{intentions}} are, {{and does not}} like what she hears. A defeated Jody finds his father <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> barn. Jody bolts the entrance and sets the barn on fire, but he cannot {{go through with it}} and releases Will. The incident leads to a reconciliation between father and son. Men from town assume Ben is the culprit and start toward him, but Will claims he accidentally started the fire by dropping his cigar.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On the ground floor of Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located {{on the ground floor of}} Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E
25|$|Though modern neo-nazis often invoke National Socialist {{iconography}} {{on behalf}} of white nationalism, National Socialist Germany repudiated {{the idea of a}} unified white race, instead promoting Nordicism. In National Socialist propaganda, Eastern European Slavs were often referred to as Untermensch, and the relatively under-developed status of Eastern European countries such as Poland and the USSR were attributed to the racial inferiority of their inhabitants. Fascist Italy took the same view, and both of these nations justified their colonial ambitions in Eastern Europe on racist, anti-Slavic grounds. These nations were not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> view; there are numerous cases in the 20th century where some European ethnic groups labeled or treated other Europeans as members of another, inferior race.|$|E
25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> school assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E

With the help of his newly hired servant, Morgiana (Amira Casar), Ali takes down the body and gives Kasim a lavish funeral.

500|$|Of Shaw's various {{reviewing}} {{activities in}} the 1880s and 1890s it was as a music critic that he was best known. After serving as deputy in 1888, he became musical critic of The Star in February 1889, writing under the pen-name Corno di Bassetto. In May 1890 he moved back to The World, where he wrote a weekly column as [...] "G.B.S." [...] {{for more than four}} years. In the 2016 version of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Robert Anderson writes, [...] "Shaw's collected writings on music stand <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> mastery of English and compulsive readability." [...] Shaw ceased to be a salaried music critic in August 1894, but published occasional articles on the subject throughout his career, his last in 1950.|$|E
500|$|There is a sharp {{contrast}} between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the movie. [...] "We wanted an art deco stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, [...] "and {{a place that was}} falling into ruin after having seen better days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a [...] "ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: [...] "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> rooms".|$|E
50|$|The Liberals weren't <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> fielding <b>their</b> {{greatest}} number of candidates, as the Communists matched their 1950 record of seven candidates, surpassing one percent {{for the first time}} (beyond 1950). Despite these advances, the only change was {{to be found in the}} Conservative-Labour battleground of Wortley, with Labour gaining the seat by a mere three votes.

500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because he thought they were out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Tarrant Hightopp, The Mad Hatter. Wasikowska {{said that}} the characters, [...] "both feel like outsiders and feel <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{separate}} worlds, and have a special bond and friendship." [...] Burton explained that Depp [...] "tried to find a grounding to the character ... {{as opposed to just}} being mad." [...] Burton also said that, [...] "In a lot of versions it's a very one-note kind of character and you know [...] goal was to try and bring out a human side to the strangeness of the character." [...] The orange hair is an allusion to the mercury poisoning suffered by hatters who used mercury to cure felt; Depp believes that the character [...] "was poisoned ... and it was coming out through his hair, through his fingernails and eyes". Depp and Burton decided that the Hatter's clothes, skin, hair, personality and accent would change throughout the film to reflect his emotions. In an interview with Depp, the character was paralleled to [...] "a mood ring, [...] his emotions are very close to the surface". The [...] Hatter is [...] "made up of different people and their extreme sides", with a gentle voice much like the character's creator Lewis Carroll reflecting the lighter personality and with a Scottish Glaswegian accent (which Depp modeled after Gregor Fisher's Rab C. Nesbitt character) reflecting a darker, more dangerous personality. Illusionary dancer David [...] "Elsewhere" [...] Bernal doubled for Depp during the [...] "Futterwacken" [...] sequence {{near the end of the}} film.|$|E

2500|$|The {{potentially}} severe {{consequences for}} individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. [...] This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. [...] Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, can find themselves open to retaliation {{by a number of}} different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters - designed to protect those who raise concerns. A whistleblower is almost always <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> fight - their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct. [...] If the accusations prove false, their career is completely destroyed, but even in case of positive decision the career of the whistleblower can be under question: their reputation of [...] "troublemaker" [...] will prevent many employers from hiring them. There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns. If a university fails to investigate suspected fraud or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal.|$|E
