The spermatic head is rounded and formed by the nucleus containing granular chromatin, firmly packed resulting in a mass extremely electron dense. The acrossome is absent.

40|$|Introduction. Monitoring of {{antibiotic}} prescribing promotes rational {{use of these}} drugs, reduces costs and slows down the progress of resistance. The objective of {{present study was to}} analyze the effects of drug utilization reform strategy realized by the Republic Health Insurance Fund of Montenegro, during the period 2000 - 2004. Material and methods. This before-after comparative pharmacoepidemiological study comprised a sample of 100 % prescription only antibiotics available in public pharmacies during the period 2000 - 2004. The drug use was calculated using A TC/DDD methodology and Wilcoxon's test for matched pairs was used in order to calculate the statistical significance of difference. Results. Antibiotic prescribing was <b>aproximately</b> lower by 12 % in 2004 in regard to 2000 (12. 80 vs. 14. 57 DDDs, p> 0. 05). The participation of this pharmacotherapeutic group in the total drug dispensing has remained almost equal (<b>aproximately</b> 8 %). The highest increase in prescribing was established for macrolides (1. 05 vs. 1. 64 DDDs, 59 %); penicillins were also prescribed more frequently (6. 41 vs. 6. 56 DDDs, 2 %). but other subgroups were prescribed less frequently: cephalosporins - (23 %) (3. 11 vs. 2. 43 DDDs) and quinolones - (63 %) f 1. 10 vs. 0. 47 DDDs). Conclusion The drug utilization reform strategy showed mostly positive effects on antibiotic prescribing during the period 2000 - 2004. Further educational activities are necessary in order to establish more rational approach to prescribing and utilization {{of antibiotic}}s. ...|$|E
