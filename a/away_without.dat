5|$|A local {{department}} store announces {{the formation of}} a new August holiday called Love Day intended to boost sales. The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces causes the garbage to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails {{to make it to the}} curb in time. As the garbage men drive <b>away</b> <b>without</b> collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on their front lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E
5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore of southwestern Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, this storm had a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of Baja California. On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, this storm turned <b>away</b> <b>without</b> causing any impact.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them <b>away</b> <b>without</b> inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|During a {{field trip}} to an archeological dig, Cartman discovers a mysterious stone triangle, which he {{promptly}} throws <b>away</b> <b>without</b> interest. Shortly after Kyle picks it up, the guide identifies the writing on the triangle as Anasazi. Kyle appears on television to discuss the find, resulting in a jealous Cartman wanting the triangle back. Cartman constantly pesters Kyle until he returns the triangle to him. Meanwhile, Leonard Maltin comes to South Park and asks Chef whether he has seen Barbra Streisand. Maltin, having seen Kyle and the triangle on television, tells Chef the boys are in great danger.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt <b>away</b> <b>without</b> a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, when Horatio was 14 and due {{to leave}} the orphanage, he ran <b>away</b> <b>without</b> waiting for the formalities. His aunt Caroline Praill—his mother's sister—who lived in nearby Edgbaston, gave him a home, while he worked as an errand boy in a Birmingham {{building}} firm. This arrangement lasted {{only a few months}} before Horatio, impatient to be reunited with his sister from whom he had been separated for six years, went to London where he began an apprenticeship with a wood engraver.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all drivers {{at the front of the}} grid got <b>away</b> <b>without</b> {{incident}} and with no changes in position. On the outside of turn three, Nico Hülkenberg was able to get around Pastor Maldonado for sixth position. Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa, who both started from the rear end of the grid, made up places early in the race, running in twelfth and thirteenth by lap 9, when Vettel came into the pit lane for his first stop. The pit stop did not go well, as his car was stationary for about six seconds. Massa in turn went past Marcus Ericsson for eleventh two laps later in a wheel-to-wheel manoeuvre through turns one and two. Meanwhile, at the front, Lewis Hamilton had built a sufficient gap to second-placed Rosberg to deny Rosberg the chance to use DRS and try to overtake.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{wanted to}} secure the {{southern}} borders of Aquitaine and decided to betroth his youngest son to Alais, the daughter and heiress of Humbert III of Savoy. As part of this agreement John was promised the future inheritance of Savoy, Piedmont, Maurienne, and the other possessions of Count Humbert. For his part in the potential marriage alliance, Henry II transferred the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau into John's name; as John was only five years old his father would continue to control them for practical purposes. Henry the Young King was unimpressed by this; although {{he had yet to}} be granted control of any castles in his new kingdom, these were effectively his future property and had been given <b>away</b> <b>without</b> consultation. Alais made the trip over the Alps and joined Henry II's court, but she died before marrying John, which left the prince once again without an inheritance.|$|E
5|$|If pure {{platinum}} {{is found}} in placer deposits or other ores, it is isolated from them by various methods of subtracting impurities. Because platinum is significantly denser than many of its impurities, the lighter impurities can be removed by simply floating them away in a liquid. Platinum is paramagnetic, whereas nickel and iron are both ferromagnetic. These two impurities are thus removed by running an electromagnet over the mixture. Because platinum has a higher melting point than most other substances, many impurities can be burned or melted <b>away</b> <b>without</b> melting the platinum. Finally, platinum is resistant to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, whereas other substances are readily attacked by them. Metal impurities can be removed by stirring the mixture in {{either of the two}} acids and recovering the remaining platinum.|$|E

5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten <b>away</b> <b>without</b> paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent tax for each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E
5|$|On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). On the bus home, Veronica {{talks to}} Meg one more time, {{but she is}} still passive-aggressive. Veronica {{explains}} to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a rest stop, Veronica sees Weevil and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives <b>away</b> <b>without</b> her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they look over at the crashed bus.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk <b>away</b> <b>without</b> getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E

5|$|This {{short-sighted}} belief had a detrimental {{impact on}} the tactical effectiveness of RAF Fighter Command until the summer, 1940. With German bombers perceived as the only prey, AOC Fighter Command Hugh Dowding and his planners devised a system and tactics which used unwieldy and tight fighter formations to bring the RAF fighters into combat with bombers, followed by set-piece tactics for the engagement. Because the bomber's return fire was considered so dangerous, fighter pilots were trained to open fire at long range, 300 to 400 yards, then break <b>away</b> <b>without</b> closing to short-range. These tactics, practised so thoroughly over the years, proved totally useless in the battle situation facing them over Britain in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal fielded {{the opening}} kickoff from Kansas kicker Scott Webb, {{returning}} it 59yards to the 41-yard line of Kansas. The return gave the Virginia Tech offense excellent field position {{to begin the}} game. Tech quarterback Sean Glennon connected on an 11-yard pass to Justin Harper for a first down on the opening play of the game, but Kansas' defense stiffened on subsequent plays. After Virginia Tech's Tyrod Taylor entered the game at quarterback, Kansas sacked Taylor twice, pushing Virginia Tech 19yards backward, out of field goal range. Because of the sacks, Virginia Tech was forced to punt the ball <b>away</b> <b>without</b> scoring any points.|$|E
5|$|Chapman played {{infrequently}} in 1936, and the captaincy {{was shared}} {{between him and}} two others. He was reluctant to bat, {{to the extent of}} dropping down the batting order to avoid doing so, and his friends believed that his nerve had gone. At the end of the season, he announced that business commitments forced him to give up the captaincy. Over the following three seasons, Chapman played for Kent in three more matches: against the New Zealand touring side in 1937 and in two Championship games in 1938. He also captained a non-representative England XI in a festival game against the New Zealanders in 1937, batting at number ten in the order and scoring 61. His remaining first-class matches were low-profile games against Oxford and Cambridge Universities; he played 13 games in his final three seasons. In his last first-class game, in 1939, he captained MCC against Oxford, scoring 12 and 0. In all first-class cricket, Chapman scored 16,309 runs in 394 matches at an average of 31.97, and held 356 catches. By the time his career ended, his weight had increased even further, and Lemmon believes that he had become an embarrassment to other cricketers. Subsequently, Chapman faded <b>away</b> <b>without</b> much comment.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, a tax {{was placed}} on land owned by the proprietors. In {{exchange}} for collecting the tax, the government promised to abandon its attempts to enforce the payment of quitrents. In 1836, a bill was passed to place a penal tax on unoccupied land. Although the Colonial Office initially refused to recommend Royal Assent, comments by Lord Durham led the Privy Council to give Royal Assent to the bill in 1838. Despite the change in property arrangements in Prince Edward Island {{with the introduction of}} these taxes, tenants were still unable to take possession of their land. In 1830, Roman Catholics were given the vote, and in 1838 the Escheat Party won a large majority in the General Assembly. Another bill to implement escheat passed the lower house, but was rejected by the Legislative Council. The leader of the Escheat Party, William Cooper, travelled to London to meet the Colonial Secretary, but he was turned <b>away</b> <b>without</b> a meeting. Instead, the Secretary advised the Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island that the government would not recommend assent to any bill advocating escheat. The Escheat Movement disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in August 480 BC, {{when the}} Persian army was {{approaching}} Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took {{command of the}} Athenian contingent of the fleet, and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail <b>away</b> <b>without</b> fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles {{appears to have been}} more-or-less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at every place where the Persian fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes would at least begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.|$|E
