In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within Brütal Legends soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of Guitar Hero and Rock Band, though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions of crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

5|$|Prior to the German invasion, the {{population}} of Jews {{was estimated to be}} about210,000, although <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> from the Lithuanian statistics department, as of 1 January 1941 there were 208,000 Jews.

It is difficult to estimate the exact number of casualties of the Holocaust and the latter number cannot be final or indisputable. The numbers given by historians differ significantly ranging from 165,000to254,000, the higher number probably including non-Lithuanian Jews among other Reich (empirical) dissenters labeled as Jewish killed in Lithuania.|$|E
