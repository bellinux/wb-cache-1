25|$|Writer Jack Olsen {{had earlier}} {{advanced}} a similar theory {{in his book}} The Bridge at Chappaquiddick, published early in 1970. Olsen's book was the first full-length examination of the case. Olsen wrote that Kopechne's shorter height (she was , a foot (30cm) shorter than Kennedy) could have accounted for her possibly not even seeing the bridge, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> Kennedy's car over unfamiliar roads, at night, with no external lighting, after she had had several alcoholic drinks at the party both had attended. Olsen wrote that Kopechne normally drove a smaller Volkswagen model car, which was much lighter and easier to handle than Kennedy's larger Oldsmobile.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Googoosh began a {{meteoric}} rise to {{fame and}} success <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> {{the edge of}} Iranian pop music further and further. Known for her flamboyant outfits and fashion sense, Googoosh wowed her pop culture hungry fans in Iran and abroad with her trademark hairdos and hip-elegant style. Iranian women changed hairdos with Googoosh and she was always {{one step ahead of}} them with a new look. Her music ranged from upbeat 1960s and 1970s pop, given an Arabic-tinged edge, to declamatory, emotional ballads dealing with love and loss, which at times edged towards chanson and Ã‰dith Piaf territory. She starred in over 25 movies, one of which was to be the most commercially successful Iranian motion picture of all time. Googoosh performed many times for the royal family and was a favorite of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's wife and children. She performed at the party given for the 1977 birthday of Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran.|$|E

She pretended to be talkun' to Conrad, but she kep' her eye on you pretty close, I can tell you. I bet she just got us there to see how him and you would act together. And I reckon she was satisfied. He's dead gone on you, Chris." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clausen's mother, Leonell Wilkes Clausen, was {{a native}} of Centerville who {{formerly}} lived in Verdunville, both communities in St. Mary Parish in South Louisiana. She died in 1999 while living in Baton Rouge. [...] "Mama Nell" [...] Clausen, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was known, <b>drove</b> a school bus, delivered food to shut-ins, worked in a school for the handicapped, and was a justice of the peace in St. Mary Parish. Clausen's late brother, Thomas Greenwood Clausen, was the last elected Louisiana superintendent of education, a position which he held from 1984 to 1988.|$|R

2500|$|She left Euple, {{her first}} husband, {{before the birth}} of their third daughter. That baby {{developed}} spinal meningitis, and Wynette tried to earn extra money by performing at night. Euple did not support her ambition to become a country singer, and according to Wynette, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> away he told her, [...] "Dream on, Baby". Years later, he appeared at one of her concerts as she was signing autographs and asked for one. She signed it [...] "Dream on, baby." [...] In 1965, Wynette sang on the Country Boy Eddie Show on WBRC-TV in Birmingham, meanwhile working as a hairdresser in Midfield, Alabama, and this led to performances with Porter Wagoner. In 1966, she moved with her three daughters (Gwen, Tina, and Jackie) from Birmingham to Nashville, Tennessee, where she attempted to get a recording contract. After being turned down repeatedly by all of the other record companies, she auditioned for the producer Billy Sherrill. Sherrill was originally reluctant to sign her, but decided to do so after finding himself in need of a singer for [...] "Apartment No.9". When Sherrill heard Wynette sing it, he was impressed and decided to sign her to Epic Records in 1966.|$|E

60|$|Lady Trevlyn went to {{her room}} to rest, leaving the girl free to ride, drive, or amuse herself <b>as</b> <b>she</b> liked.

50|$|As mayor, Geeben drove herself {{around in}} a 1983 Mercury Marquis. Every Sunday, <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> the few blocks north to the Jensen Beach Christian Church, where she was the {{treasurer}} and organist. Every week, she played bingo, and occasionally, {{she would go to}} the hair salon. Geeben balanced her bills through a typewriter and adding machine, just <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did in the 1920s.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> away, {{smiling and}} waving {{her hand to}} the old lady at her window; but the last thing <b>she</b> saw <b>as</b> <b>she</b> left the well-beloved lane, was David going slowly up the path, with Kitty close beside him, talking busily.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>drove</b> {{the latter}} {{into the back}} of a big gray-and-white sea <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went by, and when she hove it high once more while the water sluiced along her deck, Jimmy, who could look down at her from his bridge, {{recognized}} her as a vessel that had once belonged to his father. <b>She</b> <b>drove</b> past with a drenched object clinging desperately to her wheel, and Jimmy smiled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> vanished into the rain again, for it seemed to him that, as his comrade had said, fortune favored the little man now and then. Merril had evidently sent two schooners up to the cannery, but the Tyee was some sixty miles astern of the Shasta, and it was clear that the skipper of the other vessel could no longer thrash her to windward in that weather. There was, he believed, a good deal of salmon at the cannery, and all he had to do was to take the Shasta there.|$|R

60|$|He helped her, however, {{into her}} little pony carriage, and at parting {{she gave him}} her hand. He just touched it, and then, taking off his hat, bowed courteously to her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> from his door.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll just stroll on," [...] she said, but <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> away <b>as</b> swiftly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could. Her father's {{worry about}} {{obligations}} disturbed her, {{and she did}} not wish to seem too troublesome an amateur to Milt. She would see him in Livingston, and tell him how well she had driven.

60|$|So it {{came about}} that Madeline unconsciously {{admitted}} the cowboy to a place in her mind never occupied by any other. The instant {{it occurred to her}} why he was proof against the wiles of the other women <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> that amazing and strangely disturbing thought from her. Nevertheless, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was human, she could not help thinking and being pleased and enjoying a little the discomfiture of the two coquettes.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{seized the}} sheet and Carnally plied the paddle; but the warning had come too late. While the canoe slanted over until her lee side was under water <b>as</b> <b>she</b> altered her course, there was a sharp crash. Her speed slackened {{for a moment or}} two. Then <b>she</b> lifted <b>as</b> a white wave surged by; and when <b>she</b> <b>drove</b> on again the water poured in through a rent in her side.|$|R
