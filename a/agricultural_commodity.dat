25|$|Agriculture was {{the primary}} source of revenue in the Mamluk economy. Agricultural {{products}} were the main exports of Mamluk Egypt, Syria and Palestine. Moreover, the major industries of sugar and textile production were also dependent on agricultural products, namely sugar cane and cotton, respectively. Every <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity</b> was taxed by the state, with the sultan's treasury taking the largest share of the revenues; emirs and major private brokers followed. An emir's main source of income were the agricultural products of his iqtaʿ, and with those revenues, he was able to fund his private corps.|$|E
25|$|The Southern slavery-based {{societies}} {{had become}} wealthy {{based on their}} cotton and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity</b> production, and some particularly profited from the internal slave trade. Northern cities such as Boston and New York, and regional industries, were tied economically to slavery by banking, shipping, and manufacturing, including textile mills. By 1860, there were four million slaves in the South, nearly eight {{times as many as}} there were nationwide in 1790. The plantations were highly profitable, due to the heavy European demand for raw cotton. Most of the profits were invested in new lands and in purchasing more slaves (largely drawn from the declining tobacco regions).|$|E
25|$|A {{database}} containing {{pesticide residue}} data at the raw <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity</b> level is the USDA Pesticide Data Program (PDP). The USDA initiated the PDP in 1991 to test commodities in the U.S food supply for pesticide residues. Since {{the passage of}} the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), one of the focuses of the PDP has been testing foods that are most likely consumed by infants and children. The monitoring program is run by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) which partners with state agencies to collect and analyze pesticide residue data. The EPA uses this data to enhance its programs for food safety and evaluate dietary exposure to pesticides.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{relative}} price of <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> versus that of industrial commodities is analyzed via domestic {{terms of trade}} during 1990 - 2009 when trade liberalization gained impetus in Turkey. The domestic terms of trade which are improved {{in favor of the}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> during 1990 - 1998 except 1994 which is acknowledged as an economic crises year are reversed against the <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> after 1998 and plummeted in 2001 economic crises. The domestic terms of trade which are improved during 2001 - 2004 are deteriorated against the <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> after 2004. In the paper, the factors that define the domestic terms of trade during 1990 - 2009 are estimated via Least Squares Method with quarterly data. The findings of the paper revealed that the domestic terms of trade in Turkey are defined by the market mechanisms like {{the relative}} prices of the previous year and the relative production of the current year. Although the domestic terms of trade is not improved in favor of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> during the examination period, it is evident that the trade liberalization affects the domestic terms of trade in favor of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities.</b> This finding is explained by the current protectionist regulations in the liberalization of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> trade relative to the regulations in industrial commodities trade.

25|$|Residue data {{is often}} {{collected}} on raw agricultural commodities {{at the time}} of harvest which is not necessarily representative or the residue levels present {{at the time of}} consumption. The processing and preparation of commodities is subject to increase or decrease the level of residues at the time of consumption. For example, dehydration of a product may increase the concentration of antibiotic residue whereas washing of produce may reduce the concentration of a pesticide residue. Since chemical residue data is often only available at the raw <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity</b> level and consumption data is often available for foods as consumed, it is necessary to convert between foods as consumed and raw agricultural commodities. This can be completed with custom models or with national databases.|$|E
25|$|O.glaber is more {{potentially}} dangerous {{in some places}} than in others. The United States, and especially the state of California, prohibits the ant from entering lest it should disrupt the country's ecosystems. Its relationship with honeydew-producing insects and consumption of parasitoids could disrupt the biological control of certain pests, risking long-term ecological damage that could reduce biodiversity, disrupt natural communities, or change ecosystem processes. Therefore, the high-risk team and dog team of the California Department of Food and Agriculture have intercepted the ant in nursery stock and fresh plants from Hawaii, and a border station found and stopped it on beehives from Florida. California is especially vulnerable to O.glaber infestation because the state's climate resembles that of those regions where the ant already lives. Nonetheless, O.glaber would not lower crop yields, increase farming costs, degrade water supplies, or likely disrupt Californian <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity</b> markets.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, animal {{breeding}} started to decline in economic importance, as the fields had become overgrazed and denuded. It took nearly 100 years before the region developed its next major <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodity.</b> In the 19th century, Kecskemét was already part of an important wine district, but the city increased in importance after the vine-pest destroyed most vineyards in the hilly regions. Damage was less significant in the plains' areas of loose, sandy soil. In the 1870s, landowners planted large plantations of grapevines around the town. These were the basis of the 20th-century vineyards and wine industry of the 20th century in Kecskemét. Cottage-type settlements grew up at the vineyards to house workers, a pattern still characteristic of the rural areas around the town. The growth of the wine industry stimulated those of the food industry and trade. The city is still known for its barackpálinka, an apricot brandy.|$|E

40|$|The {{recent and}} rapidly growing {{interest}} in biofuel as a green energy source has raised concerns about {{its impact on the}} prices, returns and volatility of related <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities.</b> Analyzing the spillover effects on <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> and biofuel helps commodity suppliers hedge their portfolios, and manage the risk and co-risk of their biofuel and <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities.</b> There have been many papers concerned with analyzing crude oil and <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> separately. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the volatility spillovers for spot and futures returns on bio-ethanol and related <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities,</b> specifically corn and sugarcane, using the multivariate diagonal BEKK conditional volatility model. The daily data used are from 31 October 2005 to 14 January 2015. The empirical results show that in 2 of 6 cases for the spot market, there were significant negative co-volatility spillover effects, specifically corn on subsequent sugarcane co-volatility with corn, and sugarcane on subsequent corn co-volatility with sugarcane. In the other 4 cases, there are no significant co-volatility spillover effects. There are significant positive co-volatility spillover effects in all 6 cases, namely between corn and sugarcane, corn and ethanol, and sugarcane and ethanol, and vice-versa, for each of the three pairs of commodities. It is clear that the futures prices of bio-ethanol and the two <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities,</b> corn and sugarcane, have stronger co-volatility spillovers than their spot price counterparts. These empirical results suggest that the bio-ethanol and <b>agricultural</b> <b>commodities</b> should be considered as viable futures products in financial portfolios for risk management...|$|R
