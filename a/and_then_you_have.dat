25|$|On June 22, 2016, guitarist Williamson made an {{official}} statement {{for the band}} saying that the Stooges are no more."The Stooges is over. Basically, everybody's dead except Iggy and I. So it would be sort-of ludicrous to try and tour as Iggy and the Stooges when there's only one Stooge in the band <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> side guys. That doesn't {{make any sense to}} me."Williamson also added that touring had become boring, and trying to balance the band's career as well as Pop's was a difficult task.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2017, Cyrus stated that she isn't {{a big fan of}} the music video herself. [...] "'Wrecking Ball' -- I'll do it, but I don't love it...

500|$|Meanwhile, Baird had {{graduated}} {{within a matter}} of hours from anonymity to dubious icon. [...] One employment agency head who only hired legal household workers said, [...] "You have no idea, the frustration, sitting here, knocking your head against the wall, trying to do what's right. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a Zoë Baird who exposes the fact that everybody else is breaking the law." [...] The phrase [...] "to have a Zoë Baird problem" [...] became rooted in the vocabulary of the American professional and political classes.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Robert, a man {{thoroughly}} {{versed in}} arts of improving money, but thoroughly honest, said to me, [...] "Madam, I am glad you {{approve of the}} method that I proposed to you; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> begun wrong; <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> come for your interest at the half-year, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{had the money to}} put out. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost half a year's interest of £350, which is £9; for I had but 5 per cent, on the mortgage." ...|$|R
500|$|Soderbergh {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} that he made an unconventional film: [...] "I find it hilarious {{that most of the}} stuff being written about movies is how conventional they are, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> people ... upset that something's not conventional. The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within hopefully the next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though {{they go to the}} darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that [...] "you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to work really, really hard. That's about it." [...] He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that The Beatles' success {{had more to do with}} [...] "the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of The Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010: ...|$|E
5000|$|Susan has, {{on several}} occasions, {{demonstrated}} rather unusual attitudes toward school and education in general: In Soul Music, she cites school {{as one of}} the greatest obstacles to education, and in Hogfather, she compares being educated to having a communicable sexual disease, in that [...] "It made you unsuitable for a lot of jobs <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the urge to pass it on".|$|R
5000|$|Of model Jean Shrimpton, Bailey said: [...] She was {{magic and}} the camera loved her too. In a way she was the {{cheapest}} model in the world - you only needed to shoot half a roll of film <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> it. She had the knack of having {{her hand in the}} right place, she knew where the light was, she was just a natural.|$|R

Now, however, I'll order breakfast for <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better get some sleep." ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little bit older and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to think, 'What are the real battles?' 'What's really important?' You get to a certain point, and it's really hard to remember what music is and to remember what drives you." ...|$|E
500|$|Among Dylan's contemporaries, Phil Ochs was {{impressed}} by Highway 61, explaining: [...] "It's {{the kind of music}} that plants a seed in your mind <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to hear it several times. And as you go over it you start to hear more and more things. He's done something that's left the whole field ridiculously in the back of him." [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine described Highway 61 as [...] "one of those albums that changed everything", and placed it at numberfour in its list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Rolling Stone list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time" [...] ranked [...] "Highway 61 Revisited", [...] "Desolation Row" [...] and [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] at number373, number187, and numberone, respectively. In 2012, The Best 100 Albums of All Time book ranked Highway 61 Revisited as the greatest album of all time. It was also included in Robert Christgau's [...] "Basic Record Library" [...] of 1960s music and Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast. Schur said they sought to [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all summer {{to figure out how to}} get yourself out of it".|$|E

500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for several of the characters, including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{explained}} on her iTunes Radio {{channel that}} [...] "Rocket" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "most sensual songs", adding that it reminded her of the vibes of D'Angelo's song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and I always felt like it was my responsibility to be aware of kids and their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E
500|$|Like other Disney media {{products}} {{which are}} often localized through Disney Character Voices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The Lion King). A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages. Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as [...] "exceptionally challenging"; he explained, [...] "It's a difficult juggling act {{to get the right}} intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to go back and adjust for lip sync! ...requires a lot of patience and precision." [...] Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics. For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to [...] "ensure that the film feels 'local'." [...] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their [...] "blueprint" [...] in casting, and tried to match the voices [...] "as much as possible," [...] meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone. For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing. After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 900 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,300 recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Concerning the {{collaboration}} with Knowles, Petty stated: [...] "I think whenever {{you work with}} Beyoncé it's a collaboration.

[...] There are countless homages to pop culture of the past in this video. I think we were playing with Mod, and '60's and '80's iconic stuff that [...] responded to and related to." [...] She further said that during the filming Knowles put a lot of energy and made many decisions for the finished product. Talking about the development and the filming of the video, Petty said: ...|$|E
2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it.

Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{retired from}} {{acting in the}} early 1960s and later turned down the role of Belle Rosen, a {{character}} with a crucial swimming scene, in The Poseidon Adventure. (The role eventually went to Shelley Winters.) She continued to lend her name to a line of retro women's swimwear. [...] "Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity," [...] said Williams. [...] "I say to women when I talk to them, 'You girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to report to me. My suits are quality fabric.'"

2500|$|Gordon Murray {{analysed}} {{the car in}} Motor Trend 07/1990: [...] "It's {{the lack}} of weight that makes the Ferrari so exciting. There's nothing else magic about the car at all...They're asking two- and three-inch-diameter steel tubes at chassis base datum level {{to do all the}} work, and it shows - you can feel the chassis flexing on the circuit and it wobbles all over the place on the road. It really does shake about. And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one's like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it." [...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It's only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and rollbar. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the marketing Kevlar glues in with a quarter inch of rubber." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{publications}} and analysts predicted {{the failure of}} Apple Stores. It was thought {{that because of the}} stores' diminutive size and non-aggressive sales team, Apple would succeed in presenting the Mac but fail in making a significant number of sales. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that [...] "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that [...] "It's not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something's a little different." [...] In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee. According to the research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of sales per unit area in 2011, with sales of $3,085per square feet, almost doubling Tiffany & Co., the second retailer on the list. On a global level, all Apple Stores had a combined revenue of US$16billion. Under the leadership of Ron Johnson, the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in The New York Times, been responsible for [...] " [...] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets". The Apple Stores have also been credited with raising the company's brand equity, with Scott Galloway stating that the Stores are the [...] "temple to the brand which is this unbelievable experience called an Apple Store, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> this very mediocre experience called an AT or Verizon connect your phone experience for Samsung and the other Android players".|$|E
