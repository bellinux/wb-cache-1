5|$|Although Serbian public {{religious}} celebrations, {{as those}} of other peoples, were discouraged in Socialist Yugoslavia until the early 1990s, they continued among Serbian <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> public badnjak ceremony was held in Serbian Orthodox parishes in the United States during that period, as it is today.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some ceremonialists used face paint, {{performed}} {{dances with}} religious significance, and used objectionable terms regarding Native <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> OA no longer allows these practices, stating {{that this is}} in recognition of preferences of Native American groups that found such actions offensive.|$|E

5|$|Although Republicans {{expressed}} anger {{with his}} actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic.

Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African <b>Americans</b> <b>the</b> vote.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most <b>Americans</b> (<b>the</b> average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

5|$|Fort St. Joseph (the site {{of present-day}} Niles, Michigan) was {{captured}} on May 25, 1763, {{by the same}} method as at Sandusky. Potawatomis seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison outright. Fort Miami (on the site of present Fort Wayne, Indiana) was the third fort to fall. On May 27, 1763, the commander was lured out of the fort by his Native mistress and shot dead by Miami Native <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded.|$|E

5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start a war between the Soviets and the <b>Americans.</b> <b>The</b> similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J.

5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African <b>Americans,</b> <b>the</b> poor, women, and gays all became prominent.
