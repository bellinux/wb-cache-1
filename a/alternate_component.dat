40|$|Component {{inspection}} is {{an important}} part of the facilities management process, especially as repair projects play an increasing role in the life of public facilities management organizations. The decisions facility owners make with regard to component inspection effect the eventual success of their major facility repair projects. This thesis uses a total cost approach to evaluate the effect component inspection methods have on facility repair projects. This problem is examined by comparing the penalty cost of inadequate component inspection to the costs of <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> inspection methods that could have minimized the penalty cost. A general framework is developed to classify the errors that occur in component inspection and predict the penalty costs. Six major facility repair projects in which inadequate component inspection led to penalty coasts are presented and analyzed. The evidence from these cases shows that owners should pursue more costly and more accurate component inspection methods. The reduction in penalty costs due to increased accuracy outweighs the added cost so that the total cost is less. These cases also point to the usefulness of automated non-contract component inspection strategy by facility owners that considers <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> inspection methods as part of the design of facility repair projects. An understanding of the penalty cost concepts presented here will be useful to owners in the design of a component inspection strategy.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{calculation}} of the magnetic field <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> at {{the surface of the}} rotating rotor of turbo generator is presented. It is based on multiposition of the numerical calculations of the magnetic field with the rotor turns and changes of currents in the stator winding. Discrete time functions of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction are selected in points of the surface. The harmonic analysis is conducted for them. The developed method is universal in terms of excitation modes, designs and the magnetic core saturation. The theory is confirmed by computational researches in the no-load and short circuit modes of large turbo generator. In it, the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction on the rotor surface in the short-circuit mode is much greater than in the no-load mode. Values and harmonic composition of the <b>alternating</b> <b>component</b> of the magnetic induction differ substantially at different points of the rotor surface. Harmonics are ponderable in the range from the level determined by the phase structure of stator winding to the level determined by the tooth structure of its core.

40|$|Component {{interoperability}} is {{the ability}} of two or more components to cooperate despite their differences in functional and non-functional aspects such as security or performance. However, the non-functional interoperability, for the lack of adequate methods, is often handled informally. This paper presents a work-in-progress for analyzing and achieving component non-functional interoperability. The approach introduces the concept of nonfunctional required and provided interfaces (called NRI and NPI). The NRI specifies the NFRs the client component expects to be fulfilled while the NPI specifies the NFRs promised or currently supported by the supplier component. NRI and NRI are compared to determine interoperability at the NFR definition and implementation levels. The paper presents three tactics for resolving non-interoperability, including exploring for an <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> that provides a more desirable interoperability, negotiating for more attainable NFRs that are currently supported, and adding a non-functional adapter to bridge the interoperability differences. The preliminary framework is demonstrated using an empirical study that integrates a student registration and a class scheduling systems to build a new conference management system to illustrate how to determine and adapt them for integration. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The new phenylpiperazine {{derivative}} flesinoxan, {{a potent}} and selective serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) agonist, was examined under {{a procedure that}} {{has proved to be}} a reliable and sensitive method for detecting novel anxiolytic drugs believed to produce their effects at the 5 -HT 1 A receptor subtype. Key pecking by pigeons was maintained by the presentation of food following every 30 th response in the presence of a white keylight; during an <b>alternate</b> <b>component,</b> correlated with a red keylight, every 30 th response produced food and electric shock which suppressed responding (punishment). Flesinoxan doses from 0. 001 to 0. 3 mg/ kg, intramuscularly, produced significant increases in punished responding at doses that did not affect unpunished responding. Doses of flesinoxan between 1. 0 and 3. 0 mg/kg also increased punished responding but produced decreases in responding that was not punished. In a second study flesinoxan substituted for the 5 -HT 1 A anxiolytic buspirone under a drug discrimination procedure, providing further evidence that the behavioural effects offlesinoxan are mediated by 5 -HT 1 A mechanisms. Based on these findings, it would appear that flesinoxan should be a useful compound in the clinical management of anxiety...|$|E

40|$|One of the excitements {{generated}} by the cold atom systems is the possibility to realize, and explore, varied topological phases stemming from multi-component nature of the condensate. Popular examples are the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and the ferromagnetic (FM) phases in the three-component atomic condensate with effective spin- 1, to which different topological manifolds can be assigned. It follows, from consideration of homotopy, that different sorts of topological defects will be stable in each manifold. For instance, Skyrmionic texture {{is believed to be}} a stable topological object in two-dimensional AFM spin- 1 condensate. Countering such common perceptions, here we show {{on the basis of a}} new wave function decomposition scheme that there is no physical parameter regime wherein the temporal dynamics of spin- 1 condensate can be described solely within AFM or FM manifold. Initial state of definite topological number prepared entirely within one particular phase must immediately evolve into a mixed state. Accordingly, the very notion of topology and topological stability within the sub-manifold of AFM or FM become invalid. Numerical simulation reveals the linear Zeeman effect to be an efficient catalyst to extract the <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> from an initial topological object prepared entirely within one particular sub-manifold, serving as a potential new tool for "topology engineering" in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates...|$|E
40|$|Vibration is the {{sensation}} produced by sinusoidal oscillation of objects placed against the skin. The vibratory frequency is signaled by {{the frequency of}} action potentials fired by the sensory nerves and {{the total number of}} active sensory nerves is linearly related to the amplitude of vibration. In the last years many works were done evaluating the different clinical applications of the focal muscle vibration; the aim of this work is to analyze the interaction between the vibratory application and the skin. For this study the apparatus of focal muscle vibration analyzed was firstly calibrated by measuring the actual peak to peak displacement of the tip {{as a function of the}} power supplied to the shaker; then were measured the Direct Component (DC) of the force by which the shaker is pushed against the patient’s skin and the <b>Alternate</b> <b>Component</b> (AC). We observed that from displacements imposed by the tip ranging from 0 to about 200 micrometers, the applied load increases monotonically, but non linearly, with the displacement; above this value, any further increase of the peak to peak displacements actually does not lead to an effective increase of the amplitude of the mechanical stimulation. We can conclude that with this focal muscle vibration applied to the muscle we are able to stimulate the spindles that respond to 200 micrometers amplitude that are probably ones able to generate a proprioceptive signal...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pentobarbital}} and d-amphetamine were assessed on key pecking by pigeons under conventional single-key multiple schedules and under two-key multiple schedules in which discriminative stimuli appeared on one key (stimulus key) while pecks {{on a second}} key (constant key) produced food. Pecks on the stimulus key had no scheduled consequences. A 60 -second variable-interval schedule operated in one component of each multiple schedule: either extinction or a 60 -second variable-time schedule operated in the <b>alternate</b> <b>component.</b> When the alternate-component schedule was extinction, {{a high rate of}} responding was maintained in the variable-interval component of the single-key schedule; responding on both keys was maintained in the variable-interval component of the two-key schedule. Pentobarbital increased responding in the variable-interval component of the single-key schedule and increased stimulus-key, but not constant-key responding in that component of the two-key schedule. When the alternate-component schedule was changed to variable time, responding declined in the variable-interval component of the single-key schedule; stimulus-key responding was no longer maintained under the two-key schedule. Pentobarbital decreased responding in the variable-interval component of both schedules. With an exception, d-amphetamine only decreased responding in the variable-interval component of the single- and two-key schedules both when the alternate-component schedule was extinction and when it was variable time. The results suggest that the effects of pentobarbital, but not d-amphetamine, depend {{on the nature of the}} contingency (stimulus-reinforcer, response-reinforcer) that maintains responding...|$|E

40|$|Squirrel monkeys {{were trained}} to respond under a {{multiple}} fixed-interval, fixed-interval schedule in which the first response after 5 min terminated a visual stimulus {{in the presence of}} which electric shocks could occur. During one component of the schedule, correlated with one color of stimulus lights, every 30 th response also produced electric shock; responding was suppressed during this component to approximately 10 to 12 % of that occurring in the <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> in which responding was not punished. In contrast to previous research, morphine (0. 03 to 1. 0 mg/kg) increased punished responding. Unpunished responding, however, was either not affected or decreased at doses of morphine that increased punished responding. Increases in rate of punished responding also occurred when the single-schedule punishment condition was studied alone in these animals. Subsequent experimentation, which systematically analyzed the development of the rate-enhancing effects of morphine on punished responding, involved the study of drug effects in additional monkeys trained initially under a single-schedule punishment condition. The effects of morphine on punished responding were studied before, after, and then during exposure to the multiple schedule that included a component in which responding was not punished. Increases in response rate with morphine did not occur until it was administered during exposure to the multiple schedule that included a component in which responding was not punished. As with the other monkeys, once the rate increases in punished responding occurred under the multiple schedule, these effects of morphine persisted, even when the multiple schedule was removed.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} as a systematic replication of earlier work investigating the phenomenon of behavioral contrast. Behavioral contrast has been consistently reported in alternating two component multiple schedules using infra-human subjects. The {{present study was}} interested in answering the question, 2 ̆ 2 Does behavioral contrast exist in humans? 2 ̆ 2 Two experiments were performed which investigated the behavioral contrast and sequential contrast phenomena in children. In both experiments, lever press responses were analyzed using an ABA single-subject design. The children were instructed to press a lever to obtain as many tokens as possible. In Experiment I, six Ss were equally {{divided into two groups}} of three subjects each. Group I, the mult VI EXT group began the experiment by responding on an alternating two component multiple variable interval (VI) 20 seconds, extinction (EXT), mult VI EXT, schedule of reinforcement. Following stabilization of response rates on a mult VI EXT schedule, Phase I, the three Ss in this group progressed through Phase II, a mult VI 20 second schedule of reinforcement, and Phase III, a mult VI 20 second EXT schedule of reinforcement. Group II, the mult VI VI group began the experiment by responding on a mult VI 20 second VI 20 second schedule of reinforcement. Following stabilization of response rate on the mult VI VI schedule, Phase I, the three Ss in this group progressed through Phase II, the mult VI 20 -sec EXT schedule of reinforcement, and Phase III, a mult VI 20 second VI 20 second schedule of reinforcement. Behavioral contrast, in an alternating two component multiple schedule, defined as an increase in response rate in one component accompanying a decrease in response rate in the <b>alternate</b> <b>component</b> was observed in Experiment I. Regardless of the sequence of exposure to the multiple schedule, all Ss showed similar response patterns under the same multiple schedules. For example, an increase in response rate in the unchanged VI component was observed in all Ss when the response rate in the alternating EXT (previously VI) component decreased (positive behavioral contrast). A decrease in response rate in the unchanged VI component was also observed in all Ss when an increase in response rate in the alternating VI (previously EXT) component occurred (negative behavioral contrast). The appropriate change in response rate in the second component of a multiple schedule appeared to be prerequisite for the occurrence of behavioral contrast whether it be a decrease in responding when the second component programmed EXT or a stable response rate when the second component programmed a VI 20 second reinforcement schedule. In Experiment II, three Ss were exposed to a mult VI 20 second EXT schedule of reinforcement the components of which were presented in a random sequence. Sequential contrast, defined as a greater response rate during S+ when an S+ is preceded by an S- component than when S+ is preceded by other S+ components was not consistently observed in the present experiment. One of three subjects exposed to the sequential contrast experiment showed a consistently higher rate of responding during S+ components that followed an S- component than when an S+ component followed another S+ component, but the other two Ss in the experiment failed to emit response patterns characteristic of sequential contrast...|$|E
