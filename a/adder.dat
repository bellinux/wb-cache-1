5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical <b>adder</b> might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic <b>adder</b> can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{constant}} multiplication (MCM) is {{the problem}} of realizing several constant multiplications with one data using as few additions/subtractions as possible. Almost all previously proposed MCM algorithms have been using carry-propagation <b>adders.</b> However, for high-speed applications carry-save <b>adders</b> are a better choice. Although it is possible to map carry-save <b>adders</b> to carry-propagation <b>adders,</b> this mapping is inconsistent in the number of carry-save <b>adders</b> required for a given number of carry-propagation <b>adders</b> for multiplier blocks. In this work a difference-based MCM algorithm for carry-save <b>adders</b> is proposed and evaluated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of {{redundant}} binary and pipelined 2 's complement <b>adders</b> in out-of-order execution cores. Redundant binary <b>adders</b> reduce the ADD latency to {{less than half that}} of traditional 2 's complement <b>adders,</b> allowing higher core clock frequencies and greater execution bandwidth (in instructions per second). Pipelined 2 's complement <b>adders</b> allow a higher clock frequency, but do not reduce the ADD latency. Machines with redundant binary <b>adders</b> are compared to machines with 2 's complement <b>adders</b> and the same execution bandwidth and bypass network complexity. Results show that on the SPECint 95 benchmarks, the average IPC of an 8 -wide machine with 1 cycle redundant binary <b>adders</b> is 9 % higher than a machine using 2 -cycle pipelined <b>adders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{parallel}} and digit-serial implementations of area-efficient 3 -operand decimal <b>adders</b> are proposed. By using proposed analyzer circuits and {{the generation}} of correction terms with recursive schemes, our proposed decimal <b>adders</b> could perform efficient additions with three operands.

The simplest architecture is the ripple carry <b>adder,</b> which follows the standard multi-digit algorithm.

40|$|Abstract-The {{worst-case}} carry propagation {{delays in}} carryskip <b>adders</b> and block carry-lookahead <b>adders</b> {{depend on how}} the full <b>adders</b> are grouped structurally together into blocks {{as well as the}} number of levels. We report on a multidimensional dynamic programming paradigm for configuring these two <b>adders</b> to attain minimum latency. Previous methods are applicable only to very limited delay models that do not guarantee a minimum latency configuration.

5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the <b>adder</b> is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|The filmography of English actor Robert Bathurst {{comprises}} both {{film and}} television roles spanning almost 30 years. Bathurst made his acting debut for television in 1982 in the never-broadcast pilot episode for the BBC sitcom Blackadder, though his character Prince Henry was recast when the Black <b>Adder</b> series was commissioned. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1980s, Bathurst appeared in episodes of The Lenny Henry Show, Who Dares Wins, The District Nurse, Red Dwarf, and Chelmsford 123, before starring alongside his Cambridge Footlights colleague Stephen Fry in the short-run series Anything More Would Be Greedy. He also appeared in the films Whoops Apocalypse (1986) and Just Ask for Diamond (1988).|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} set during the Elizabethan era (15581603). The {{principal}} character, Edmund, Lord Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), is the great-grandson {{of the original}} Black <b>Adder,</b> {{and is now a}} member of the London aristocracy. Unlike his forefather, he is both dashing and intelligent, although he is still scheming and cynical in his outlook. The series follows his attempts to win the favour of the childish Queen Elizabeth I (Miranda Richardson). As before he is aided, and often hindered, by two less-than-intelligent sidekicks, his servant Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and Lord Percy Percy (Tim McInnerny), heir to the Duchy of Northumberland, with whom Blackadder has a grudging friendship.|$|E

40|$|Tree Multipliers are {{frequently}} {{used to reduce}} the delay of array multipliers. The objective of tree multipliers is to utilize the concept of carry save <b>adders</b> in reducing the partial product. Two well known tree multipliers Wallace and Dadda uses full <b>adders</b> and half <b>adders</b> for the aforesaid purpose. This paper implements a multiplier which will perform reduction of partial products using 4 bit Carry Lookahead <b>Adders</b> primarily instead of Full <b>adders.</b> This will result in fewer reduction stages as Full <b>adders</b> reduces 3 partial products bits to 2 giving a 1. 5 to 1 ratio whereas 4 bit CLA will reduce 9 partial products bits to 5 giving 1. 8 to 1 ratio.

5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death <b>adder</b> (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff <b>adder,</b> but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
