We find that the origin of <b>a</b> <b>country's</b> legal system is more important than its religion and language in explaining shareholder rights. However, <b>a</b> <b>country's</b> principal religion helps predict the cross-sectional variation in creditor rights better than <b>a</b> <b>country's</b> openness to international trade, its language, its income per capita, or the origin of its legal system. Catholic countries protect the rights of creditors less than other countries, and long-term debt is less important in these <b>countries.</b> <b>A</b> <b>country's</b> openness to international trade mitigates the influence of religion on creditor rights.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>country</b> {{with a large}} {{trade surplus}} would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if <b>a</b> <b>country</b> encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities.

Having positive external wealth means <b>a</b> <b>country</b> is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

Originally titled Stanzas Wrote in <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> Church-Yard, the poem was completed when Gray was living near St Giles' parish church at Stoke Poges. It was sent to his friend Horace Walpole, who popularised the poem among London literary circles. Gray was eventually forced to publish the work on 15 February 1751, to pre-empt a magazine publisher from printing an unlicensed copy of the poem.|$|E
