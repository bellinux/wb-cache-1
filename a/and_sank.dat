5|$|The Battle of Beirut was a naval battle off {{the coast}} of Beirut during the Italo-Turkish War. Italian fears that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to {{threaten}} the approach to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area. On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters, retired, then returned <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> an Ottoman torpedo boat.|$|E
5|$|U-47s eighth patrol {{began on}} 14 October 1940 {{when she left}} her home port of Lorient. While her eighth patrol lasted ten days, she sank four enemy vessels and damaged a further two in only two days. On 19 October, U-47 damaged the British vessel Shirak <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> Uganda and Wandby, {{both of which were}} British registered. The next day, the U-boat damaged the British vessel Athelmonarch <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> La Estancia as well as Whitford Point. She {{returned}} to port three days later on the 23rd.|$|E

5|$|All three {{ships were}} {{initially}} assigned to various squadrons in the First Fleet {{and then became}} flotilla leaders in mid-1914. When the war began in August, Amphion and Fearless and their flotillas (the 3rd and 1st Destroyer Flotillas (DF), respectively) {{were part of the}} Harwich Force. The morning after Britain joined the war, the force sortied on a patrol to the Dutch coast. The 3rd DF encountered <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> a German minelayer, SMS Königin Luise, but not before she had laid many of her mines. While returning home the following morning, Amphion accidentally struck a mine on 6 August off the Thames Estuary <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> with the loss of 132 crewmen killed. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to be sunk in the First World War. The wreck site is protected and may not be dived upon without permission from the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|At {{least six}} of the U.S. ships—including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, SanFrancisco, Portland, and Helena—fired at Akatsuki, which drew {{attention}} to herself with her illuminated searchlight.

5|$|By March, {{the newly}} {{converted}} submarine had begun laying mines off the French coast. The French Navy trawler Elisabeth struck one of UB-12s mines off Calais on 13 March <b>and</b> <b>sank.</b> Five days later, the British auxiliary minesweeper Duchess of Montrose sank {{with a loss}} of 12 men after detonating a mine laid by UB-12 off Gravelines.|$|E
40|$|Todays {{smartphone}} users face {{a security}} dilemma: many apps they install operate on privacy-sensitive data, although they might originate from developers whose trustworthiness {{is hard to}} judge. Researchers have addressed the problem {{with more and more}} sophisticated static and dynamic analysis tools as an aid to assess how apps use private user data. Those tools, however, rely on the manual configuration of lists of sources of sensitive data as well as sinks which might leak data to untrusted observers. Such lists are hard to come by. We thus propose SUSI, a novel machine-learning guided approach for identifying sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> directly from the code of any Android API. Given a training set of hand-annotated sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks,</b> SUSI identifies other sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> in the entire API. To provide more fine-grained information, SUSI further categorizes the sources (e. g., unique identifier, location information, etc.) <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> (e. g., network, file, etc.). For Android 4. 2, SUSI identifies hundreds of sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> with over 92 % accuracy, many of which are missed by current information-flow tracking tools. An evaluation of about 11, 000 malware samples confirms that many of these sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> are indeed used. We furthermore show that SUSI can reliably classify sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> even in new, previously unseen Android versions and components like Google Glass or the Chromecast API...|$|R

30|$|Flow matrix creation: Firstly, {{the list}} of all sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> {{that can be found}} in an Android app’s source file are {{gathered}} from a predefined text file, which was downloaded from the FlowDroid GitHub repository. These sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> are then inserted into two individual vectors. The two vectors are combined into a single two-dimensional matrix. Each position within the matrix represents a unique source-to-sink connection (flow) dependent on the corresponding positions of the source’s <b>and</b> <b>sink’s</b> in their original respective vectors.|$|R

5|$|During World War I the South Arklow Lightvessel Guillemot, {{operated}} by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, had given warning of a U-boat.

The 3 -D model employed is identified and biosphere, ocean and fossil fuel sources <b>and</b> <b>sinks</b> are discussed. Some preliminary model results are presented...|$|R

5|$|The British patrol {{aircraft}} prevented Group Trutz {{from attacking}} the Home Fleet. At 21:48 on 17 July, a Consolidated B-24 Liberator assigned to No. 86 Squadron detected <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> U-361; {{none of the}} submarine's crew were rescued. Eight minutes later a No. 210 Squadron Consolidated PBY Catalina piloted by Flying Officer John Cruickshank spotted U-347 on the surface. The submarine's anti-aircraft guns damaged the Catalina, killing the navigator and wounding Cruickshank as well as three other crewmen, but the pilot continued his attack <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> U-347 with depth charges. The Catalina managed to return to base, and Cruickshank was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action. That night the Home Fleet sailed through {{the gap in the}} German patrol line that had been opened by the sinking of the two submarines.|$|E
5|$|The German {{destroyer}} Z3 Max Schultz {{was one of}} four Type 1934-class destroyers {{built for}} the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during the mid-1930s. Completed in 1937, two years before the start of World War II, the ship spent most of her time training although she did participate in the occupation of Memel in early 1939. Shortly before the beginning of World War II, the ship accidentally rammed <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> a German torpedo boat. Max Schultz spent the following month under repair. In mid-February 1940, while proceeding into the North Sea to search for British fishing trawlers, one of her sisters, , was bombed and sunk by a patrolling German bomber. While trying to rescue survivors, Max Schultz struck a British mine <b>and</b> <b>sank</b> with all hands.|$|E
