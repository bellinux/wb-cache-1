5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current <b>ability</b> <b>levels</b> and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to clarify the {{characteristics}} of ADL ability among different ambulatory level groups. The subjects were 448 partially dependent older adults (PD; 126 male, 81. 7 ± 8. 22 year; 322 female, 82. 5 ± 7. 25 year) over 60 years of age, and they were divided into 3 groups based on ambulatory activity level; G 1 could not walk without assistance; G 2 could walk with a stick; G 3 could walk without assistance. The PD were asked 17 ADL questionnaires representing seven ADL domains to evaluate the ADL ability. Total and domain ADL scores, and achievement rates for each item were calculated, and compared among different ambulatory activity groups. It is confirmed that ADL <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> in PD significantly relates to ambulatory level and becomes gradually higher as the ambulatory activity level advances. It is considered that in the G 1, lower limb <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> is low, and the contribution of <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> regarding changing posture and manual activities to total ADL <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> is high. On the other hand, in the G 3 the achievement levels in manual activities and high-difficulty ADLs using lower limbs reflects the differences in the ADD <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> among individuals. Gender differences for ADL ability are not found in any ADL domain, while age differences are found in only the G 3. It is inferred that for the G 1, the achievement levels of ADLs are largely influenced by disease morbidity and age contributes very little to the decline of <b>ability</b> <b>level...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{organization}} {{of social studies}} classroom communication and the format for presenting such communication were investigated. High school students (n- 282) were assigned to groups; determined by the possible combinations of lesson organization, {{also referred to as}} lesson commonality (high versus medium versus low), method of reading (oral versus silent), and student <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> (above average versus average versus below average). After the students were presented an economics lesson, a test was administered to determine their comprehension of the lesson. The students who read the lesson silently scored significantly higher than students who received an oral presentation of the lesson. A significant interaction between lesson organization and student <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> indicated that highly organized lessons increased student learning under certain <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> conditions.

40|$|The {{field study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the simulation game Battle Squares on the learning of the map reading skill of grid-reference determination by year 7 students. The effect of <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> and sex differences on the acquisition of gridreferencing skills were also examined. The simulation game developed is a modification of the traditional children's game Battleships. The modifications produced the major features of the grid system used on Australian Survey Map sheets without substantially altering the characteristics of the game Battleships. Two treatment groups played the simulation game, one group having experienced both a pre test and a post test and the other group only the post test. A third treatment did the pre test and post test without experiencing the simulation game. Students in both treatment groups which experienced the simulation game showed significant gains in the learning of grid-referencing skills. Students in upper <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> groups gained significantly better scores on the post test than students in lower <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> groups. Both upper and lower <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> groups showed significant gains. Girls performed significantly better than boys on the post test. Both boys and girls showed significant gains {{as a result of the}} simulation game experience. <b>Ability</b> <b>level</b> was a more important moderating variable than sex difference in producing variations in performance on the post test of grid-referencing skills. The explicit educational aims of the simulation game were effectively achieved in a short period of time, while maintaining student motivation and interest. The success of the simulation game in producing significant changes in grid referencing skills would appear to have resulted from the frequent practise of these skills the simulation game playing experience offers...|$|R

25|$|In {{composing}} the opera, Mozart evidently kept in {{mind the}} skills of the singers intended for the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary comic actors asked to sing for the occasion. Thus, the vocal lines for Papageno—sung by Schikaneder himself—and Monostatos (Johann Joseph Nouseul) are often stated first in the strings so the singer can find his pitch, and are frequently doubled by instruments. In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer, who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is famous for its difficulty. In ensembles, Mozart skillfully combined voices of different <b>ability</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Ethiopian teach English {{for life}} (TELL) program aims to improve English {{teaching}} in primary schools. [...] New textbooks in English, Amharic and other mother tongues have been printed {{and are being}} distributed to primary schools. TELL is instigating a nationwide in-service teacher training program and an EGRA. Between 2009 and 2011, TELL began by training a group of master trainers in improved instruction techniques with new English textbooks and teacher guides. Master trainers trained trainers of teachers in each region. Trainers of teachers provided a 4 day in-service training to primary school teachers. Teaching techniques for grades 1 and 2 teachers focused on teaching children to speak and listen to English, {{to read and write}} English and on vocabulary and story telling. Seventeen different techniques were taught to grades 3 and 4 teachers which continued the focus on reading, writing, vocabulary and story telling. In a follow-up three months later, some of the teachers were using the new techniques. Teachers for grades 1 and 2 had most difficulty with using unfamiliar techniques that required children to think and talk aloud independently. Teachers for grades 3 and 4 seldom used double entry. This is a technique that requires interaction with peers to categorize information from a text. Constraints for all teachers included large class sizes, children at different <b>ability</b> <b>levels,</b> lack of time and lack of new textbooks. This type of one-shot training is not enough. There needed to be further follow-ups and collective participation involving the headmaster and other teachers to encourage problem solving and reflection.|$|E
