5|$|Matrices {{which have}} a single row are called row vectors, and those {{which have a}} single column are called column vectors. A matrix which has {{the same number of}} rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with <b>an</b> <b>{{infinite}}</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E
5|$|The Greek philosopher Zeno {{considered}} {{the problem of}} summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result, but rejected it as an impossibility: the result was Zeno's paradox. Later, Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox, but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes, {{as it had been}} prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus. It was through Archimedes's method of exhaustion that <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result. Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} {{was thought}} lost until {{the discovery of}} the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> infinitely small parts can be used to determine its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>an</b> <b>infinite</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other {{intermediate}} {{processes in}} which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided {{it is the case}} that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
