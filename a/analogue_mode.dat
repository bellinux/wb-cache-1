40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that it is {{legitimate}} to talk about mental imagery, and thus, to claim that spatial information is coded in an <b>analogue</b> <b>mode.</b> Evidence from research with blind people indicate that they can perform mental rotation and that analogue spatial cognition does not depend on visual information. It is therefore proposed that, if the blind can perform mental rotation in an <b>analogue</b> <b>mode,</b> there exists a common mode, for processing spatial information, which is not modality specific. The results of the presented study, which was conducted on eight blind subjects, and was intended to extend previous findings, was not conclusive.

40|$|Reversible inhibitors are {{associated}} with fewer side effects than covalently binding ones and are, therefore, advantageous for treatment of conditions involving endogenous enzymes. Transition state analogue structures provide one design paradigm for such inhibitors; this paradigm seeks to exploit the capability of an enzyme active site to stabilise a transition state or associated intermediate. In contrast, structures that retain the functionality, and scissile bond of the substrate, can also act as reversible inhibitors; these are referred to here as substrate variants to distinguish them from substrate <b>analogues.</b> Their <b>mode</b> of action depends on destabilisation of a reaction-path transition state or states. As the mode of destabilisation can be quite varied the scope to exploit substrate variants as reversible inhibitors is substantial.

40|$|Mental {{rotation}} is {{a widely}} accepted concept that suggests an <b>analogue</b> <b>mode</b> of visual informationprocessing in certain visuospatial tasks. Typically, these tasks demand the discrimination between the image and mirror-image of rotated figures, for which human subjects need an increasing reaction time depending on the angular disparity between the rotated figures. In pigeons, tests of this kind yielded a time-independent rotational invariance, suggested as being {{the result of a}} non-analogue information-processing that has evolved in response to the horizontal plane that birds perceive from above while flying. Given that marine mammals use the water surface as the horizontal plane for orientation while diving, the ability of a California sea lion to mentally rotate twodimensional shapes was tested. Using a successive twoalternative matching-to-sample procedure, the animal had to decide between the image and mirror-image of a Summary previously shown sample. Both stimuli were rotated by a multiple of 30 ° with respect to the sample. The animal’s reaction time was measured by a computer-controlled touch-screen device, rewarding the animal for pressing its snout against the stimulus matching the sample. A linear regression analysis of the animal’s mean reaction time against the angular rotation of the stimulus yielded a significant correlation coefficient. Thus, the present data {{can be explained by the}} mental rotation model, predicting an image-like representation of visual stimuli in this species. The present results therefore correspond well with those found for human subjects, but are inconsistent with the data reported for pigeons.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{inherent}} temporality embedded within the complex stratigraphic {{sequence of the}} ‘tell’ site of Çatalhöyük, an important Anatolian Neolithic settlement situated upon the Konya Plain, South-Central Turkey. Recently the Çatalhöyük Research Project has digitized all of its single context excavation data, fully integrating their digital archive within an intra-site GIS, {{as an aid to}} analysis and interpretation. This process of digitisation excludes the Harris matrix, which, despite being integral to the recording system, and the main source of relative temporal data {{for the development of the}} site, remains an <b>analogue</b> <b>mode</b> of analysis. This research digitally visualises the stratigraphic sequence, both dynamically and intuitively (moving beyond conventional archaeological methods of phasing and periodisation), utilising the temporal capabilities of ArcGIS 10 to generate robust and dynamic intra-site spatiotemporal models. By focusing upon two case studies as a ‘proof-of-method’ (a ‘typical’ sequence of two fully excavated superjacent buildings – Buildings 65 and 56, and one unusually large and well preserved burnt building – Building 77), the experimental appending of stratigraphically-based temporal data onto the spatial component of an excavation dataset within a GIS, and subsequent analysis of associated material culture within its spatiotemporal context, has proved an innovative way to articulate and visualise the site’s space through time. This represents a transparent, repeatable and critical approach to post-excavation analysis, using current computing technologies. Focusing upon integrated spatiotemporal analysis of excavation data and associated material culture within these models also facilitates greater understanding of the relationship between space and time in archaeology within the data structure of primary recording in archaeological excavations. The resultant spatiotemporal animations combine this data as a new type of ‘visual narrative’ that may help illustrate the social meaning of these structures, potentially telling the bigger story of the site within its wider context of the Anatolian Neolithic...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the growing}} {{availability}} of internet connected devices and {{the widespread use}} of computer mediated communication appear to have reduced barriers to a potential 'normalisation' (Bax 2003, O'Dowd 2010) of online intercultural exchanges (OIE's) in foreign language classes. However, if informal and professional communication has been transformed by digital technology, classroom-based foreign language education has largely remained in a "walled -garden" or an <b>analogue</b> <b>mode.</b> Mentoring of OIE's could be facilitated by students bringing their personal digital devices to a wifi equipped class, but this might also result in unwelcome disruption (Conolé 2008) of teaching space. The use of Web 2. 0 and informal social networking sites to set up 'Telecollaboration 2. 0 ' projects (Guth & Helm 2010) could facilitate communication between learners but boundaries between personal and professional spaces might become uncomfortably blurred for both teachers and learners. More complete integration of OIE's into classroom practices may necessitate a radical rethinking of both teacher and learner roles. While many teachers and learners may now accept some pedagogical benefits of OIE's, they may be ill-prepared either to invest time in such exchanges or to transform their practices {{to take full advantage of}} their virtual partners. Perhaps more complex cultural obstacles are at play here preventing OIE's from becoming a 'core' rather than a 'peripheral' (O'Dowd 2010) element of foreign language education. The C OIE project seeks to 'build bridges' between formal and informal spaces, and to enable 848 learners from a British university (BU), a French university (FU) and a Polish university (PU) to develop digital literacy, linguistic, intercultural and pedagogical competences. The diverse means and modes of interaction and the large numbers of learners involved allow the members of the teaching network to reflect on the different possibilities and the challenges to integrating OIE activities into their pedagogical programs. At the same time, a small group of PU learners involved in the OIE are studying for a master in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and have participated in the exchange as both learners and trainee-teachers. A group of 6 experienced and 6 trainee language teachers from the C project are to be selected. Using Scollon and Scollon's (2004) concepts of 'historical body' and 'historical space' as a backdrop, we will study and analyse narratives relating their past experiences and their current attitudes to technology use in and outside the classroom. A quantitative/qualitative survey will enable us to further identify their professional and informal practices. Examination of interactions during the OIE will help to confirm their technology uses. A semi-directed interview will enable us to capture and analyse their visions of the place of OIE's in their imagined teaching futures. How far will these teachers and learner/teachers' grounding in existing discourses of practice be an obstacle to future transformations in their classrooms? This study's findings may help us to better understand barriers and bridges to wider, deeper integration of OIEs in future foreign language programs...|$|E

Undertaken over a seven-year period, the research investigates sound and acoustics as key features of prehistoric sacred sites, which {{have yet to be}} fully assessed in terms of sonic features and peculiarities. The project significantly expands interdisciplinary research in the areas of art, sound and archaeology, linking <b>analogue</b> pre-computer <b>modes</b> of perception with a distribution method that makes the best of contemporary forms. The research has been published in Time and Mind 4 (2); ‘The end my friend’ in The Design Journal 15 (2); ‘The hills are alive’ in The Wire magazine 339 (Spring 2012) and expanded online at www. thewire. co. uk, and in keynote lectures and seminars at the ‘Punkt’ festival, Kristiansand (2012), ‘Soundworks’, London (2012) and 9 th European Academy of Design conference, Porto (2011). The project looks at two locations, including the Preseli hills in Pembrokeshire, site of the bluestones that were transported to Stonehenge in approximately 2500 BC. A parallel study has been made of Avebury, Wiltshire, a constructed sacred site.
