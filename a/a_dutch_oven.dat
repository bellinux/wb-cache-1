25|$|In the Netherlands, <b>a</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> {{is called}} a , which {{literally}} translates to frying pan or roasting pan. An other name for it is sudderpan, which literally translates to 'simmerpan' or 'simmering pot'. The design most used today is a black (with blue inside) enameled steel pan, that is suitable for gas and induction heating. The model was introduced in 1891 by BK, a well known Dutch manufacturer of cookware. Cheaper and lighter in weight than cast iron, {{it proved to be}} a revolution in the kitchen. A braadpan is mainly used for frying meat only, {{but it can also be}} used for making traditional stews such as hachée. Cast-iron models exist, but are used less frequently.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven</b> is a {{thick-walled}} cooking {{pot with}} a tight-fitting lid. Dutch ovens are usually made of seasoned cast iron, however some Dutch ovens are instead made of cast aluminium, or are ceramic. Some metal varieties are enameled {{rather than being}} seasoned. Dutch ovens {{have been used as}} cooking vessels for hundreds of years. They are called casserole dishes in English speaking countries other than the United States ("casserole" [...] means [...] "pot" [...] in French), and cocottes in French. They are similar to both the Japanese tetsunabe and the Sač, a traditional Balkan cast-iron oven, and are related to the South African Potjie and the Australian Bedourie oven.|$|E

5000|$|Recipes for Dutch {{apple pie}} {{go back to}} the Middle Ages. An early Dutch {{cookbook}} from 1514, Een notabel boecxken van cokeryen ("A notable little cookery book"), documents a recipe for Appeltaerten (compare modern Dutch [...] "apple pies"). This early recipe was a simple one, requiring only a standard pie crust, slices of especially soft apples with their skin and seeds removed, and den selven deeghe daer die taerte af ghemaect es (roughly meaning [...] "the same dough that the pie crust is made of") to fill in the top. It was then baked in <b>a</b> typical <b>Dutch</b> <b>oven.</b> Once baked, the top crust (except at the edges) would be cut out from the middle, after which the apple slices were potentially put through a sieve before the pie was stirred with a wooden spoon. At this point the book recommends adding several spices to the pie, namely: cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, mace and powdered sugar. Finally, after mixing the ingredients into the pie with cream, it is once again put into the oven to dry.|$|R

From time to time a man would ride at a foot-pace into the Club compound, and listlessly loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building. These were supposed to be chambers. Men lived in them, meeting the same white faces night after night at dinner, and drawing out their office-work till the latest possible hour, that they might escape that doleful company.|$|E
