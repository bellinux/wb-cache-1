The vehicle is modeled as a two longitudinally <b>aligned</b> <b>wheels,</b> having two degree of freedom, while the rough ground is modeled as an homogeneous normal field. The time delay induced effect is here overcome by means of a Taylor expansion of the delayed input. In this way the Markovianety of the response is preserved.

40|$|A diwheel {{is a novel}} vehicle made up of {{an inner}} frame which is {{encompassed}} and supported by two large coaxially <b>aligned</b> <b>wheels.</b> The inner frame is typically supported by a common axle or roller type idler wheels and as a result, is free to oscillate back and forth relative to the outer wheels. The outer wheels are driven from the inner frame and forward motion is achieved through a reaction torque generated by the eccentricity of the centre of gravity (CoG) of the inner frame. During operation, diwheels experience slosh (when the inner frame oscillates) and tumbling (when the inner frame completes a revolution). In this paper the dynamics of a generic diwheel are derived. Three control strategies are then proposed; slosh control, swing-up control and inversion control. Finally, simulations are conducted and compared with experimental results all performed on a diwheel built at the University of Adelaide. B. Cazzolato, J. Harvey, C. Dyer, K. Fulton, E. Schumann, T.

Laboratory and field experiments show the high mobility of the robot. This video also describes the localization and mapping strategy that consists in combining 3 D odometry with 3 D scanning and scan registration.

40|$|Troubleshooting {{the causes}} of bandsaw {{cracking}} {{is not a simple}} matter. An in-depth understanding of sawfiling practices is required for efficient operation and maintenance of bandsaws for sawmilling. Bandsaw cracking can result from one or several factors. The following information and checklist provide a starting point for sawfilers in determining causes of cracking in bandsaws that are 6 in. and wider. Front cracks can result from the following problems: 1. Allowing the wheels to wear round at the front, or tracking the saw too far off the front, either of which will leave the front edge unsupported 2. Casehardening the throats of teeth by using a grinding wheel unduly hard, running at too high a speed, or feeding too rapidly to the saw 3. Cross-aligning the wheels 4. Improper tension with the saw too open (i. e., too large a tension radius) just below the teeth Center cracks in line 2 to 3 in. back from the points of teeth are generally caused by tracking the saw too far forward of the wheels or by rounded wheels on the front edge, or both. Barring accidents and incompetence, a 12 -in. -wide 14 -gauge saw on 8 -ft wheels should never crack within a reasonable lifetime, and should wear down to at least 10 or even 8 in. in width. It is not good practice to put a narrow 14 -gauge saw that was previously run on 8 -ft wheels onto smaller wheels. The sawfiler must always check to see that saws have uniform tension, proper pitch (to prevent crowding the back on the <b>wheels),</b> properly <b>aligned</b> <b>wheels,</b> perfectly square or balanced swaging, perfect side dressing (to provide suitable side clearance), rounded gullets, and sharp teeth with points free of glaze or casehardening. Vibration increases undue bandsaw strain. Consequently, particular attention needs to be given to the wheels, their shafts, and bearings. Wheels must be round and balanced, and shafts must be free of play. Occasionally, sawfilers can determine causes of cracking from past knowledge of the bandsaw’s performance. When this does not work, however, the accompanying checklist can be used to systematically check off potential causes until, by the process of elimination, the actual cause is found...|$|R

50|$|Friction is {{the main}} reason this action is effective. If a car is moving across a surface in any {{direction}} other than the direction it's pointed, it is skidding (or sliding), and a sideways load is being imposed against the tires. This causes a lot of friction, even if the tires are allowed to rotate freely. By turning the front wheels into the direction of the skid, the front <b>wheels</b> will become <b>aligned</b> with the direction of travel. The side load will no longer be imposed against the front tires, and they will then roll freely to match the speed of the vehicle. This reduces the friction between the front tires and the surface. But the rear tires will still be sliding sideways, and the greater friction that exists will cause the back end to trail directly behind the front end, similar to a badminton birdie in flight, thus the car straightens out. As the car straightens, the front wheels must be kept aligned with the direction of travel to keep the friction of the front tires at or below the friction of the rear tires, or a skid in the opposite direction will quickly develop. The key is to keep the front <b>wheels</b> <b>aligned</b> with the direction the vehicle is moving-not the direction it is pointed.|$|R
40|$|When {{a vehicle}} with <b>wheels</b> <b>aligned</b> in pairs turn, the wheel {{traveling}} around {{the outside of the}} curve has to roll farther than the wheel on the inside. This means that some sort of device must must be used to allow the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds to prevent wear on the tires. This is usually a mechanical device where the input rotation controls the sum of the two output rotations, this is known as a differential. This solution however has some shortcomings, the biggest one is that the total amount of force that can be transferred between the tires and the road surface is limited by the tire with the least traction. In slippery conditions this can be a big problem since it only takes one wheel to lose traction in order to prevent the vehicle from accelerating. In this thesis a locking differential is used to overcome this shortcoming, this gives the driver the option to lock the shafts of the driving wheels together. This is done by pushing two cogwheels, one attached to each shaft, together. The aim of this thesis is to shorten the lock- and unlock-time of the locking differential by aligning the cogwheels using the service brakes and available sensors. The results were evaluated by implementing the software in a truck and doing test runs on Scanias test track. These tests showed that the system greatly improved both lock- and unlock-times but at cost of lower driver comfort. With additional work with some fine tuning of the system, the overall performance could probably be increased even more...|$|R
40|$|As {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to achieve orbit at Saturn in 2004, Cassini has collected science data throughout its four-year prime mission (2004 - 08), {{and has since}} been approved for a first and second extended mission through 2017. Cassini carries a set of three "fixed" reaction wheels and a backup reaction wheel (reaction wheel # 4) is mounted {{on top of an}} articulable platform. If necessary, this platform could be articulated to orient the backup reaction wheel with the degraded wheel. The reaction wheels are used primarily for attitude control when precise and stable pointing of a science instrument such as the narrow angle camera is required. In 2001 - 02, reaction wheel # 3 exhibited signs of bearing cage instability. As a result, reaction wheel # 4 was articulated to <b>align</b> with reaction <b>wheel</b> # 3. Beginning in July 2003, Cassini was controlled using wheel # 1, # 2, and # 4. From their first use in the spring of 2000 until today, reaction wheels # 1 and # 2 have accumulated more than 3. 5 billions revolutions each. As such, in spite of very carefully management of the wheel spin rates by the mission operation team, there are some observed increases in the drag torque of the wheels' bearings. Hence, the mission operations team must prepare for the contingency scenario in which the reaction wheel # 1 (in addition to wheel # 3) had degraded. In this hypothetical fault scenario, the two remaining reaction wheels (# 2 and # 4) {{will not be able to}} provide precise and stable three-axis control of the spacecraft. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of controlling Cassini using the two remaining reaction wheels and four thrusters to meet the science pointing requirements for two key science operational modes: the Optical Remote Sensing and Downlink, Fields, Particles, & Waves operation modes. The performance (e. g., pointing control error, pointing stability, hydrazine consumption rate, etc.) of the hybrid controllers in both operations scenarios will be compared with those achieved using an all-thruster controller design. Strength and weaknesses of the hybrid control architecture are assessed quantitatively...|$|R
