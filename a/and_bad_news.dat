25|$|Elizabeth {{became the}} {{catalyst}} in the uneasy – and ultimate breakup of – the Savage–Hogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan's overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth. At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches {{during the fall}} of 1988, including matches against King Haku, Akeem, <b>and</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>News</b> Brown that aired on Saturday Night's Main Event. In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth's safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, Slick and Akeem's tag-team partner, The Big Boss Man (who wrestled together as The Twin Towers) when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climatic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth's well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan. At the 1988 Survivor Series, Hogan's obviously friendly behavior toward Elizabeth angered Savage, something pro-heel commentator Jesse Ventura played up during a post-match interview with Savage. Savage emphatically denied any animosity between himself and Hogan, but Savage would become increasingly jealous and wary of Hogan as the weeks went by.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model in which some of the firm’s {{information}} (“new”) can be disclosed verifiably and some information (“type”) cannot, to show that some firms may voluntarily withhold good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> We describe an equilibrium in which high-type firms withhold good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> whereas low-type firms disclose good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Under some parameter values, this equilibrium exists when other more traditional equilibria are ruled out by standard equilibrium refinements. The model explains some otherwise anomalous empirical evidence concerning stock price reactions to disclosure, provides some new empirical predictions, and suggests that mandatory disclosure requirements may have the undesirable consequence of {{making it more difficult}} for firms to reveal information that cannot be disclosed credibly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{flows of}} <b>bad</b> <b>and</b> good <b>news</b> as {{a feature of}} the firm’s information environment. We argue that to the extent that managers delay reporting <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> this leads to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> being more concentrated. Measuring flows of <b>bad</b> <b>and</b> good <b>news</b> using flows of negative and positive abnormal stock returns, we find that firms with higher volatility of operations and managerial incentives to withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> exhibit relatively more concentrated <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> flows. This relative concentration is also positively associated with lower earnings quality and a higher risk of shareholder litigation. Our results suggest that the relative concentration of <b>bad</b> <b>and</b> good <b>news</b> flows is related {{to the quality of the}} firm’s information environment...|$|R

The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by Larry Bowa on October 24, 1986. Boros said at the time, [...] "I was prepared {{for the fact that}} I wouldn't be coming back. ... It's like the good news <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> joke.

2500|$|Luger began wrestling in the Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) {{territory}} of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He got his first victory on October 31, 1985, against Cocoa Samoa and won the Southern Heavyweight Championship from Wahoo McDaniel the next month. For a short time, he feuded with Barry Windham before they began teaming up against Sir Oliver Humperdink {{and his team of}} Ed [...] "The Bull" [...] Gantner, Kareem Muhammed, and The White Ninja. On September 1, 1986, he fought NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair for the title at a show Battle of the Belts III, which resulted in a 60-minute draw. As a result, Flair retained the title. Towards the end of his run in Florida, Luger was involved in angles with Kevin Sullivan <b>and</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>News</b> Allen. He was also in a steel cage match with Bruiser Brody, where Brody stopped cooperating, leading to Luger climbing over the cage and leaving the match.|$|E
2500|$|Bret Hart {{started a}} slow face turn at WrestleMania IV in spring 1988. Hart <b>and</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>News</b> Brown {{were the last}} 2 {{competitors}} in a 20-man Battle Royal and looked to be co-existing heels after eliminating the Junkyard Dog. But Brown then double crossed Hart, hitting him with his Ghetto Blaster finisher before throwing him over the top rope for the win. Immediately after being declared the winner and being awarded a huge trophy, Hart attacked Brown and smashed up the trophy starting his face turn. Neidhart eventually joined Bret's side in the feud with Brown causing a rift between the Foundation and manager Jimmy Hart. As a result, the Hart Foundation were increasingly pushed as fully fledged fan favorites. In the summer of 1988, the Hart Foundation began a feud with WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) for the title. At the inaugural SummerSlam in August 1988, they challenged Demolition for the WWF Tag Team Championship but ended up losing the match after Ax hit Hart with Jimmy Hart's megaphone leaving Smash to get the pinfall. Jimmy Hart had [...] "managed" [...] Demolition alongside their regular manager Mr. Fuji for the match {{as part of the}} ongoing Hart Foundation split. On the October 29 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, they faced Demolition in a rematch for the title but lost due to outside interference by The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers (Jacques and Raymond), old rivals of the Hart Foundation and, until a few months previously, a fan favourite team. In the late fall of 1988, Jimmy Hart signed the Rougeaus who, in the storyline, claimed 25 percent of the Hart Foundation's contract. The Hart Foundation continued their feud with the Rougeaus, and formed an alliance with [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan. At the Royal Rumble in early 1989, Duggan and the Hart Foundation defeated Dino Bravo and the Rougeaus in a two out of three falls match to end the feud.|$|E

40|$|Breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> is {{a complex}} and {{frequent}} clinical task for physicians working in oncology. It can {{have a negative impact}} on patients and their relatives who are often present during breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> consultations. Many factors influence how the delivery of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> will be experienced especially the communication skills used by physicians. A three-phase process (post-delivery phase, delivery phase, pre-delivery phase) has been developed to help physician to handle this task more effectively. Communication skills <b>and</b> specific breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> training programs are both necessary and effective. A recent study conducted in Belgium has shown their impact on the time allocated to each of the three phases of this process, on the communication skills used, on the inclusion of the relative in the consultation and on physicians' physiological arousal. These results underscore the importance of promoting intensive communication skills <b>and</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> training programs for health care professionals.

He marched to Bangor, levelled the cathedral, and that of Saint Asaph, by fire, burnt the episcopal palaces and canons' houses. So formidable did he become that the king issued writs, to the lieutenants of no fewer than thirty-four counties, to assemble their forces at Lichfield, to crush Glendower.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} whether {{managers}} delay disclosure of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> relative to good news. If managers accumulate <b>and</b> withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> up {{to a certain}} threshold, but leak and immediately reveal good news to investors, then we expect the magnitude of the negative stock price reaction to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> disclosures to be greater than the magnitude of the positive stock price reaction to good news disclosures. We present evidence consistent with this prediction. Our analysis suggests that management, on average, delays the re-lease of <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> to investors. 1...|$|R

When God said, Let that man be; when God first thought of us, if I may so speak, before the {{foundation}} of the world- -he thought of us as good. He created each of us good in his own mind, else he would not have created us at all. But why were we not good when we came on earth? Why do we come into this world sinful? Why does God's thought of us, God's purpose about us, seem to have failed? We do not know, and we need not know. St. Paul tells us that it came by Adam's fall; that by Adam's fall sin entered into the world, and each man, as he came into it, became sinful. How that was we cannot understand--we need not understand. Let us believe, and be silent; but let us believe this also, that St. Paul speaks truth not in this only but in that blessed and glorious news with which he follows up his sad <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> 'As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.' ...|$|E

A {{fortnight}} since, on the 2d of January, a petition was brought by deputies from the Common Council of London, asking the king {{to return to the}} capital when all disturbance should be suppressed. King Charles, however, knew not that these gentlemen had the power to carry out their promises seeing that the seditious have the upper hand in the capital, and answered them to that effect. His answer was, however, methinks, far less conciliatory and prudent than it might have been, for it boots not to stir up men's minds unnecessarily, and with a few affectionate words the king might have strengthened his party in London. The result, however, was to lead to a fierce debate, in which Pym and Lord Manchester addressed the multitude, and stirred them up to indignation, and I fear that prospects of peace are further away than ever. In other respects there is good <b>and</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Yorkshire and Cheshire, Devon and Cornwall, have all declared for the crown; but upon the other hand, in the east the prospects are most gloomy. There, the seven counties, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Cambridge, Herts, Lincoln, and Huntingdon, have joined themselves into an association, and the king's followers dare not lift their heads. At Lichfield, Lord Brook, a fierce opponent of bishops and cathedrals, while besieging a party of Cavaliers who had taken possession of the close, was shot in the eye and killed. These are the only incidents that have taken place." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the model}} of an asset market with {{strategic}} interaction among traders, this paper proves that the occurrence of asset price overreaction and underreaction to new information depends on the proportion of conservatism traders, proportion of heuristic traders, degree of conservatism bias, degree of representativeness heuristic {{and the number of}} traders in the market. Specifically, the asset price overreacts to good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> underreacts to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> when the total representativeness heuristic minus the total conservatism bias in the market is greater than zero but less than one; otherwise, the asset price underreacts to good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> overreacts to <b>bad</b> <b>news...</b>|$|R

We find that macroeconomic announcements are most important when they contain <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> for bond returns in expansions and, to a lesser extent, good news in contractions. In expansions, the bond market responds most strongly to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> in non-farm payrolls, while in recessions good news about inflation is relatively more important. We also document that macroeconomic news impacts the volatility of bond returns at all maturities by increasing jump intensities and altering the jump size distribution.

40|$|In this article, we use an {{experimental}} approach {{to examine the}} effect of reporting regimes on asset prices. We examine four different reporting regimes: the no recognition (NR) regime where no expected future cash flows are recognized; the full recognition (FR) regime where both the expected good <b>news</b> <b>and</b> expected <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings; the good news recognition (GR) regime where only the expected good news pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings; <b>and</b> the <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> recognition (BR) regime where only the expected <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> pertaining to the next period cash flows are recognized in current earnings. We find that the NR, BR, and GR regimes are associated with more intense asset price bubbles than the FR regime. We also find that between the BR and GR regimes, the BR regime is associated with more intense asset price bubbles than the GR regime. Our findings shed insights about how biased (non-neutral) reporting regimes could affect the price formation process. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
