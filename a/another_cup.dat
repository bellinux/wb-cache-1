25|$|Roma {{were able}} to add <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> to their {{collection}} in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over Blackpool in the Anglo-Italian Cup. During much of the 1970s, Roma's appearance in {{the top half of}} Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club {{were able to}} achieve during the decade was third in 1974–75. Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders Giancarlo De Sisti and Francesco Rocca.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} season, neither team would reach the quarter {{final stage of}} the Cup. Chelsea were eliminated from the competition in the 4th round, after losing 0–3 to Manchester City at home, while, in the 5th round, Leeds United were upset in a 2–3 away defeat by Fourth Division outsiders Colchester United. Chelsea, however, went on to reach {{the final of the}} European Cup Winners' competition, played in Piraeus, Greece, at Karaiskakis Stadium, where they faced Real Madrid. After yet <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> final that went into a replay, the first game ending 1–1 and the second one 2–1 to Chelsea, the English team won its first European trophy.|$|E

Five weeks later, the teams met in a replay, which went to the Bernese 3–1. In the summer of that year, YB was invited to tour North America. The team played there against some American teams, Liverpool (1–1), and the Republic of Ireland national team (a 4–1 win for YB). YB produced impressive results overseas for Swiss football and was enthusiastically received by thousands upon its return to Bern. From 1957 and 1960, YB were Swiss champions four times in a row. During this time, YB {{became one of the}} more successful teams in European football and was superior to all Swiss opponents. 1958 brought yet <b>another</b> <b>Cup</b> when YB defeated Grasshoppers in a final replay, 4–1.|$|E
25|$|Bourque, Cam Neely and Keith Crowder led the Bruins to <b>another</b> <b>Cup</b> Final {{appearance}} in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers. The Bruins {{lost in a}} four-game sweep, but a memorable moment in the would-be fourth game ensued, when {{in the second period}} with the game tied 3–3, a blown fuse put the lights out at the Boston Garden. The rest of the game was cancelled and the series shifted to Edmonton. The Oilers completed the sweep, 6–3, back at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in what was originally scheduled as Game Five. The event is considered to be the reason the Bruins began work on a new arena. Boston returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990 (with Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, Bobby Carpenter, and rookie Don Sweeney, and former Oiler goalie Andy Moog and Reggie Lemelin splitting goaltending duties), but again lost to the Oilers, this time in five games.|$|E

She dances in a trance and empties <b>another</b> <b>cup,</b> which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E

25|$|October: The month started poorly as a 2–0 home reverse against Cheltenham Town was {{followed}} days {{later by the}} team's elimination from <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> competition, this time losing 1–0 away to Bristol Rovers in the League Trophy. The Shots picked up in form mid-October and recorded their first back-to-back wins of the season against Oxford and Morecambe, with Morgan again on the scoresheet in both fixtures. The results lifted Aldershot into the League Two playoff places {{for the first and}} only time in the season. The next game - away to Crewe - would be a landmark for Aldershot Town captain Anthony Charles, the defender picking up his 200th appearance for the club. The match went poorly for Charles as the team lost 3–1, a result which {{was followed}} a week later by another defeat by the same scorline at home to Bury. Both striker Morgan and manager Dillon were sent off, the latter for complaining about the performance of the match officials.|$|E
500|$|Immature, unopened fruit bodies can {{be mistaken}} for truffles, but are {{distinguished}} by their hollow interior. Mature specimens somewhat resemble the [...] "earthstar scleroderma" [...] (Scleroderma polyrhizum), but this yellowish-brown species {{does not have the}} purple coloration of Sarcosphaera coronaria. Peziza ammophila (formerly classified in the genus Sarcosphaera) has an exterior surface that is colored brown to dark brown, and when young it is cup-shaped. Neournula puchettii also has a pinkish-colored hymenium, but it is smaller and always cup-shaped. Geopora sumneriana is <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> fungus that superficially resembles S.coronaria in its form and subterranean growth habit; however, the surface of its hymenium is cream-colored with [...] tinges, and its outer surface is covered with brown hairs. Geopora sepulta may also be included as a potential lookalike to S.coronaria, as it is macroscopically indistinguishable from G.sumneriana.|$|E
500|$|Other lookalikes include Hymenoscyphus species, {{including}} H.calyculus, {{but these}} can be distinguished by their distinct stalks, and growth on smaller woody debris like sticks and twigs, rather than logs and stumps. Many other small, yellow discos have fringed or hairy margins to the discs, like Anthracobia melaloma; this latter species grows on or near moss, rather than wood. Chlorosplenium chlora is another small cup fungus resembling B.citrina. It has a bright yellow outer surface, but the hymenium becomes develops greenish tints in age. The common jellyspot fungus (Dacrymyces stillatus) is usually smaller but can approach the dimensions of B.citrina. Similar in color, its fruit bodies are usually blob-like rather than cup shaped. <b>Another</b> <b>cup</b> fungus that grows on dead beech wood is Neobulgaria pura, but its fruit bodies are larger, ranging from [...]|$|E

500|$|In {{its first}} {{season in the}} new building, Smythe fired coach Art Duncan after five games and hired Dick Irvin to coach. [...] Irvin {{promptly}} led the Maple Leafs to their first Stanley Cup as the Maple Leafs, and the franchise's third overall. [...] While the Leafs {{would go to the}} finals every year except for 1934 and 1937 during Irvin's nine-year tenure, they were unable to win <b>another</b> <b>Cup.</b> By 1940, Smythe believed that Irvin had taken the Leafs as far as he could, and decided to replace him with former Leafs captain Hap Day, who had retired. Smythe also knew that he would be away in the war and felt that Irvin would not be tough enough without Smythe to back him up. Meanwhile, the Montreal Canadiens had had a ten-win season, and were looking for a new coach. At the suggestion of Smythe, Irvin became the new coach of the Canadiens.|$|E

That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Stevenage {{announced}} that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with defensive partner Jon Ashton, from fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers. Despite the strong transfer speculation over the summer, he captained the side in Stevenage's {{first game of the}} 2012–13 season, scoring the third goal in a 3–1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup. Shortly after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. His second goal of the campaign came in <b>another</b> <b>cup</b> competition, scoring from close range to briefly restore parity in a 3–2 defeat away to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy in September 2012. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4–1 loss to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award {{as a result of his}} work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated — [...] "we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to day work and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was once again placed in temporary charge while the club searched for a new manager. Just four days later, he took charge of Stevenage's televised away trip to promotion-chasing Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1–1 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead despite them having to play with ten men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early dismissal. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was [...] "proud of the phenomenal performance", and that [...] "the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity we faced was probably something I haven't seen all season, to that level anyway". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was again able to concentrate solely on the playing side of his game. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals. During his successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts made 239 appearances in all competitions, an appearance record that places him sixth on the club's all-time appearance list, and scored 27 goals.|$|E

[...] In the 1934 FA Cup Final, Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals. He captained City to a 2–1 victory over Portsmouth. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics. This was typical for a captain of his era, as managers of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.|$|E

2500|$|The Maple Leafs and Canadiens {{met again}} in the 1951 finals, with five {{consecutive}} overtime games played in the series. Defenceman Bill Barilko managed to score the series-winning goal in overtime, leaving his defensive position (in spite of coach Joe Primeau's instructions not to) to pick up an errant pass and score. Barilko helped the club secure its fourth Stanley Cup in five years. His glory was short-lived, as he disappeared {{in a plane crash}} near Timmins, Ontario, four months later. The crash site was not found until a helicopter pilot discovered the plane's wreckage plane about [...] north of Cochrane, Ontario eleven years later. The Leafs did not win <b>another</b> <b>Cup</b> during the 1950s, with rumours swirling that the team was [...] "cursed," [...] and would not win a cup until Barilko's body was found.
