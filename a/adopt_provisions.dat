40|$|To {{mitigate}} the durability issues arising from steel reinforced structures, current {{research in the}} structural engineering field {{has been focused on}} the feasibility of replacing steel with corrosion resistant materials. A promising alternative has been glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars as internal reinforcement. While extensive testing has certified that GFRP bars perform adequately as tensile reinforcement, structural design codes have yet to <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> for its implementation as compressive reinforcement. Quantifying the compressive behaviour of GFRP bars – the rela-tionship between strength and unbraced length, as well as the modulus of elasticity – {{is the first step toward}} developing code provisions. This experimental program consisted of 34 specimens of 25 M GFRP bars tested under di-rect compression; the lengths of the specimens were varied to establish the relationship between length and strength. A pure crushing failure with an ultimate compressive strength of 730 MPa was observed for all specimens under the nominal un-braced length of 230 mm. Longer specimens failed through a global buckling of the bar, with ultimate compressive strength decreasing with increasing unbraced bar length. The average compressive modulus of elasticity was determined to be 60 GPa. Manuscript edited by Karren Yang. Translated b...|$|E

Using a dataset of sovereign bond offerings from 1995 to early 2004, we test the importance of standardization for the modification provisions relating to payment terms. We provide evidence that (a) standardization may lead parties to <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> not necessarily out of preference and (b) standards, nonetheless, may change. The process of change, however, is not necessarily quick or straightforward. In the sovereign bond context, change came by way of an "interpretive shock". Contracts with modification provisions requiring the unanimous consent of bondholders (UACs) suddenly became vulnerable to change with less than unanimous approval through the unexpected use of exit consents. After the shock, sovereigns and investors did not initially react with a significant shift in contract terms. However, we provide evidence that after this initial lull (once investors and sovereign gained experience {{on the value of}} allowing modification of payment terms with less than unanimous consent), large shifts in contract terms followed, moving sovereign bond contracts even further away from UACs toward collective action clauses (CACs). We also report evidence that issuer's attorneys dealing with a high volume of sovereign offerings were the driving factor behind this delayed large shift in contract terms. ...|$|E

The tax treatment of these cross-border transactions is affected by double tax agreements. As tax treaty networks will likely continue to expand, concerns about tax treaty abuse might be expected to grow.

It is contended that a general definition in South Africa's Income Tax Act of 'beneficial ownership' would assist in the interpretation of the term for the purposes of South Africa's tax treaties. It is submitted that the scope for the source taxation of passive investment income (viz. dividends, interest and royalties) in the developing country could be magnified through treaty negotiations.

40|$|To {{contain the}} costs of {{conflicts}} between labor and management, governments in the advanced democracies have adopted far-reaching provisions that regulate labor-management disputes. This close control means that the legal climate is an important determinant of victory in these struggles, but {{there is almost no}} statistical research on the recent politics of labor-management relations despite the theoretical importance of this issue. To begin to fill this void, this study uses a pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis that detects the conditions that best explain the presence of right-to-work laws in U. S. states since 1960. Non contingent findings suggest that racial divisions and small business dominance increase the probability that the legal context will favor manage-ment instead of labor. Historically contingent results suggest that an accord between labor and large firms that broke down after the early 1970 s also influenced these perennial political struggles. Why do some states <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> like right-to-work laws that help employers rather than workers? Accurate answers to this question would have broad implications.

Sebelius – the Supreme Court’s {{decision}} {{upholding the}} individual mandate in Obamacare as a tax, with Arizona Christian Schools v. Winn – the Supreme Court’s decision denying standing to taxpayers with an Establishment Clause challenge {{to a state}} tax credit. It argues that these cases aggravate a growing tension between the economic and legal analyses of taxation by reducing the legal significance of economic analysis in constitutional cases. It suggests that Arizona Christian Schools was a truly radical decision because it conceptualized tax expenditures as private action immune from constitutional attack, rather than state action subject to constitutional limitations, making tax expenditures legally invisible. The article parses the Court’s economic and legal approach, and contends that the Court misunderstood the important issues. It explains how tax cuts are distinguishable from spending through the tax law, and why tax expenditures – in the aggregate – should be legally important. It argues that the Court’s approach to tax expenditures not only reduces the fundamental protection that the Constitution guarantees individuals, but also has other troubling legal and policy implications. These decisions weaken the revenue-raising role of taxation, blur the conceptual structure of the tax law, and undermine the tax reform efforts of other branches of government. They jeopardize established legal doctrine by destabilizing the precedents on unconstitutional conditions attached to tax benefits, which depend on conceiving tax benefits as government subsidies or privileges. These decisions encourage legislatures to <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> that favor high-income taxpayers, while discouraging transparent and equitable government.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{specific}} type of crime, which is, today called a millennium crime. This crime is identity theft. It is not a new crime, but technological development makes it a difficult crime to combat, as nowadays it can be committed by both traditional, so-called non-sophisticated methods, and by more sophisticated, technological means, since the advent of the internet. Identity theft is a crime committed against a person’s means of identification or their financial information. The criminal, legally or illegally obtains another person’s means of identification for the purpose of either himself (or others) using it to commit other illegal activities. Iraq, currently, has no dedicated law to deal with identity theft. Therefore, the Iraq courts will find it difficult when they seek to apply existing legal texts, to deal with it effectively. Through an examination of Iraqi criminal laws, this thesis will assess whether existing Iraq criminal law is adequate to combat identity theft, and it will assess whether Iraq courts can effectively judge an accused who obtains another person’s means of identification, and then uses to commit other crimes. It seems that, first sight that identity theft shares common elements with theft offence in Iraq law, and thus, the Iraqi courts may use the current theft offence laws to fight identity theft, but this study will show that this has limitations and drawbacks. Comparative analysis with the relevant UK and US laws used to combat identity theft will form part of this analysis, in an effort to assess the effectiveness of this approach, and illustrate its weaknesses. While this thesis preparation was being undertaken, the Iraqi Government proposed a project called the Information Crimes Project 2011. This project inter alia proposed to govern identity theft with new model laws. This thesis demonstrates that this project will not succeed in realising this objective, and the thesis shows, in conclusion, existing laws, as well as proposed laws, are inadequate to govern identity theft in Iraq, and their inadequacy requires either a judicial or legislative solution. The thesis demonstrates the limitations of judicial solution because the application of the principle of legality, and concludes that the most effectively way for Iraq to combat identity theft would be to enact a new, dedicated law to fight identity theft. To assist the Iraqi legislature to enact an appropriate piece of legislation, this thesis analyses relevant UK and US laws, and assesses elements of those laws, and their utility for the Iraqi legislature, should it seek to borrow or <b>adopt</b> <b>provisions</b> from them for a new Iraqi identity theft law.
