5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the <b>antihelix,</b> and opens into the ear canal. The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the <b>antihelix,</b> antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
25|$|When {{most of the}} alar lobule {{tissue is}} missing, the nose collapses; the {{correction}} is with an ear concha cartilage-graft harvested from the <b>antihelix,</b> a donor site where the cartilage is most rigidly curved, thus is ideal for replacing an alar lobule.|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of {{granuloma}} annulare (GA), affecting both ear <b>antihelixes,</b> in a 28 -year old male patient that {{presented with a}} 1 -year history of non-tender, firm, skin-colored, 1 ~ 5 mm papules on both ear <b>antihelixes.</b> There was no history of trauma. An excisional biopsy specimen taken {{from one of the}} lesions of the right ear revealed infiltration of histiocytes and lymphocytes around a zone of collagen alteration in the dermis. Based on the clinical and pathological findings, the patient was diagnosed with a rare case of bilateral GA of both antihelixes; this is the first report in the Korean dermatology literature...|$|R
50|$|The <b>antihelix</b> (anthelix) {{is a part}} of {{the visible}} ear; the pinna.The <b>antihelix</b> is a curved {{prominence}} of cartilage parallel with and in front of the helix on the pinna.|$|E
50|$|The <b>antihelix</b> {{normally}} forms a symmetric Y-shaped {{structure in}} which the gently rolled (folded) crest of {{the root of the}} <b>antihelix</b> continues upwards as the superior crus, and the inferior crus branches forwards, from the root, as a folded ridge. The root of the inferior crus of the <b>antihelix</b> sharply defines the rim of the concha. Moreover, the inferior crus also forms the wall that separates the concha from the triangular fossa. The root and superior crus of the <b>antihelix</b> form the anterior wall of the scaphoid fossa, and the helix forms the posterior wall. The triangular fossa dips within the Y-arms of the superior and inferior crura. The corrugated contours of these auricular crests and valleys provide a pillar effect (support) that stabilizes the pinna. The vertical walls of the conchal cup translate to a semi-horizontal plane as the concha merges with the folded crest of the <b>antihelix.</b> The scapha-helix is nearly parallel to the plane of the temporal surface of the head. If the roll of the <b>antihelix</b> and its crest are effaced and flat, rather than rolled or folded, the steep pitch of the conchal wall continues into the un-formed <b>antihelix</b> and scapha and ends at the helix, with little interruption. Said planar orientation places the scapha-helix complex nearly perpendicular to the temporal plane of the head — because of which the ear appears prominent, thus, such an ear also lacks the stability provided by the pillar effect, and so allows the superior auricular pole to protrude. In the literature, effacement (deficiency) of the antihelical fold is the foremost subject of most discussions of the prominent ear, because it is an aurical deformity manifested as a spectrum of defects and deformities — ranging from an indistinguishable <b>antihelix</b> (with a confluent concavity, from <b>antihelix</b> to scapha and the helical rim projected outwards and forwards) to loss of definition solely of the superior <b>antihelix</b> (with prominence of the upper pole of the ear).|$|E

Thus, a big cavum conchae is reduced without any excision of cartilage and the ear moves towards the head to the desired degree.|$|E
5000|$|... (i) Underdeveloped antihelical foldThis {{anatomic}} deformity occurs consequent to the inadequate folding of the <b>antihelix,</b> {{which causes}} the protrusion of the scapha and the helical rim. The defect is manifested by {{the prominence of}} the scapha (the elongated depression separating the helix and the <b>antihelix)</b> and the upper-third of the ear; and occasionally of the middle third of the ear.|$|E
50|$|This <b>antihelix</b> {{plastic surgery}} is {{performed}} with the incision-suture technique. A long incision is made {{on the back of}} the ear and a strip of skin is removed. The cartilage is completely cut through in several places. With thick cartilage, the back of the <b>antihelix</b> is made thinner by using a scalpel to remove cartilage. If the cavum conchae (hollow before the ear canal entrance) is large, it is made smaller by additionally removing a crescent-shaped piece of cartilage from the concha. Or a so-called conchal rotation is performed by first removing muscle and connective tissue from the sulcus posterior (region where the ear is attached to the head), and then the ear is turned towards the head with sutures running between the pericranium and the cartilage of the concha, thus reducing its distance to the head. Using several mattress sutures that are anchored in the cartilage, a new <b>antihelix</b> fold is formed, or a weakly developed <b>antihelix</b> fold is bent more strongly. After the insertion of a drainage tube for 1 or 2 days, the skin wound {{on the back of the}} ear is sutured. Occasionally the newly formed <b>antihelix</b> is additionally fixed with outer mattress sutures that are made over small swabs so that they don’t cut into the skin. Dressing is usually applied for 1 or 2 weeks.|$|E

50|$|The pinnaThe {{external}} ear (pinna) is a surgically challenging anatomy {{composed of a}} delicate and complex framework of shaped cartilage that is covered, on its visible surface, with thin, tightly adherent, hairless skin. Although of small area, the surface anatomy of the {{external ear}} is complex, consisting of the pinna (the auricle) and the external auditory meatus (auditory canal). The outer framework of the pinna is composed of {{the rim of the}} helix, which arises from the front and from below (anteriorly and inferiorly), from a crus (shank) that extends horizontally above the auditory canal. The helix merges downwards (inferiorly) into the cauda helices (tail of the helix), and connects to the lobule (earlobe). The region located between the crura (shanks) of the <b>antihelix</b> is the triangular fossa (depression), while the scapha (elongated depression) lies between the helix and <b>antihelix.</b> The <b>antihelix</b> borders in the middle (medially) to the rim of the concha (shell) and the concha proper, which is composed of the conchal cymba above (superiorly) and the conchal cavum below (inferiorly), which are separated by the helical crus, and meet the <b>antihelix</b> at the antihelical rim. The tragus (auditory canal lobule) and the antitragus (counterpart lobule) are separated by the intertragal notch; the auditory canal lobule does not contain cartilage, and displays varied morphologic shapes and attachments to the adjacent cheek and scalp.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lower}} part of the helix the {{cartilage}} is prolonged downward as a tail-like process, the cauda helicis; this is separated from the <b>antihelix</b> by a fissure, the fissura antitragohelicina.|$|E

5000|$|The Mustardé {{technique}} is an otoplastic surgery (otoplasty) for pinning protruding ears. The method belongs {{together with the}} Stenström [...] and Converse methods to the traditional otoplasties.It is <b>antihelix</b> plastic surgery performed with the suturing technique.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a plastic}} surgery of the <b>antihelix</b> that {{is carried out}} with the scratch or scoring technique. Underlying this method is the {{evidence}} that the cartilage bends itself convexly to the opposite side after scratching or scoring.|$|E

5000|$|Ear print {{analysis}} {{is used as}} a means of forensic identification intended as an identification tool similar to fingerprinting. An earprint is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, <b>antihelix,</b> tragus and antitragus).|$|E
5000|$|Morel's ear is the {{complete}} or partial {{absence of the}} helix or <b>antihelix</b> of the outer ear. Named after Bénédict Morel, a French psychiatrist who regarded {{it as one of}} the hereditary [...] "stigmata of degeneration" [...] that allowed medical professions to identify the mentally ill.|$|E
5000|$|Stahl’s ear {{deformity}} {{describes the}} presence of a third crus (shank) in the pinna, which produces a pointed elfin ear. The third crus is additional to the two crura (shanks) of the normal triangular fossa (depression), which traverses the scapha (elongated depression separating the helix and the <b>antihelix).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{corrective}} splint is emplaced {{by inserting}} {{it to the}} rim of the gully of the deformed ear, then rolling over the ear-edge onto the splint, and fastening it with adhesive tape. Afterwards, the splinted ear is affixed {{to the side of the}} head with adhesive tape. In the case of ears without a gully, helix (rim), or <b>antihelix</b> (common prominent-ear characteristics), the splint is emplaced slightly away from the ear-edge, which then is rolled onto the splint in order to be shaped into a proper helix (ear rim), and also to facilitate the re-formation of the <b>antihelix.</b> In the case of Stahl’s ear deformity (characterized either by a bulging or a kinked gully), the splint is firmly emplaced upon the defect or deformity, fastened in place, and affixed to the side of the head.|$|E
5000|$|According to Weerda: cosmetically disfiguring {{cartilage}} edges {{along the}} anterior {{surface of the}} <b>antihelix</b> if the cartilage is scratched or scored too deeply or is injured; post-operative bleeding; haematoma; relapse (ears protrude again); too closely pinned ear; hypertrophic scar; keloid; hypersensitivity; pressure damage (necrosis) if hard bandages are applied too tightly; perichondritis (inflammation of the cartilage); stronger asymmetry of the ears.|$|E
5000|$|A long {{incision}} is made on {{the back}} of the ear and a strip of skin is removed. Through an incision in the cartilage in the cauda helicis (lower end of the ear cartilage) or in the scapha the skin, together with the perichondrium is raised on the anterior surface of the <b>antihelix.</b> A rasp is inserted in the resulting skin-perichondrium tunnel to blindly score or scratch the cartilage of the anterior (front side) of the <b>antihelix.</b> The skin wound {{on the back of}} the ear is sutured and finally a bandage is applied for 1 or 2 weeks, or longer in exceptional cases. The hollows of the ear on the front (anterior) side of the ear (cavum conchae, scapha) are modelled with ointment-containing swabs for several days and supported this way.According to the opinion of Weerda [...] this method is not suitable for older patients due to the limited elasticity of the cartilage.|$|E
50|$|The inner conch {{piercing}} {{is located}} {{at the center of the}} ear, the cup-shaped area adjacent to the ear canal. An outer conch piercing is positioned in the flat portion of the ear between the rim/edge (helix) and the ridge that defines the <b>antihelix.</b> Both piercings are performed in much the same manner as other ear cartilage piercings and cared for in the same way as well.|$|E
50|$|Through stab incisions in the retroauricular sulcus (the groove {{behind the}} ear), permanent, non-absorbable sutures are placed {{invisible}} {{under the skin}} around the cartilage of the <b>antihelix</b> using a special technique, pulled tight and knotted. When the sutures are tightened, the ear moves towards the head. The cartilage is not worked on. A protruding earlobe can be pinned closer to {{the head with the}} Merck stitch method if the cartilage of the ear extends a little into the earlobe.|$|E
5000|$|... c) Full-thickness incisions. One {{full-thickness}} incision {{along the}} desired {{curvature of the}} <b>antihelix</b> permits folding it with slight force, thereby creating an antihelical fold (as in the Luckett procedure). Yet, because such a fold is sharp and unnatural in appearance, the technique was modified as the Converse-Wood-Smith technique, wherein two incisions are made, running parallel to the desired antihelical fold, and tubing sutures are emplaced {{to create a more}} deﬁned fold of natural contour and appearance.|$|E
50|$|Ear print {{analysis}} {{is used as}} a means of forensic identification intended as an identification tool similar to fingerprinting. An earprint is a two-dimensional reproduction of the parts of the outer ear that have touched a specific surface (most commonly the helix, <b>antihelix,</b> tragus and antitragus). The first ear print identification of a criminal was made in Switzerland in 1965 and ear print analysis has also been successfully used to solve crimes in the UK and the Netherlands. In addition to identification, the height of an ear imprint at a crime scene may also provide investigators with information regarding the stature of the perpetrator.|$|E
