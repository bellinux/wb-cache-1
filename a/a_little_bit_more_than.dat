In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and {{you have got to}} use your brain <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in League One. It's developed me as a player because you {{need to learn how to}} perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E

[...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When all is said and done, Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E

[...] While comparing her to Kesha, Idolator wrote that [...] "Dev's beats come off a bit more mellow and her songs {{a little bit more}} electro than pop."
