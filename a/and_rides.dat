5|$|The {{regional}} transit agency, renamed to Sound Transit {{the following}} year, began operating its Sound Transit Express buses under contract with Community Transit in September 1999. The new express buses connected park <b>and</b> <b>rides</b> in southwestern Snohomish County, {{the only part}} of Community Transit's service area within the Sound Transit taxing district, to Downtown Seattle, including the newly opened, 1,000-stall Ash Way Park & Ride in northern Lynnwood. Sound Transit funded several capital projects to improve bus service on the Interstate 5 corridor, including direct access ramps from HOV lanes to Lynnwood and Ash Way park <b>and</b> <b>rides</b> that opened in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In 2011, the existing Mountlake Terrace park and ride was expanded with an 890-stall parking garage and bus platforms in the median of I-5 connected by a pedestrian bridge.|$|E

40|$|As a {{multimodal}} travel behavior, park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> includes several trip modes such as car, walking, bus, or railway. And people’s choice of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> {{is influenced by}} many factors. This paper, based on the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> behavior survey in Beijing, will analyze {{the relationship between the}} perception of the influencing factors and the behavior intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by using structural equation modeling. The conclusions suggest that the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> choice for travelers is a passive behavior which means giving up driving the car is mainly caused by the serious traffic congestion. Furthermore, improving the service level of the park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities <b>and</b> the comfort for riding bus or railway will increase the utilization of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> facilities. The perceptions of the influencing factors have both direct and indirect effects on the travel intent for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> by the interaction among the influencing factors...|$|R

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, <b>and</b> <b>rides</b> over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} and {{long-term effects of}} park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> are more complex than generally acknowledged. In 1994, studies of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> were carried out in Oxford and York. The success of park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> in attracting users was confirmed, and these users reported high levels of satisfaction. However, some users had switched from modes other than car and others {{were found to be}} making additional trips which had been attracted by the opportunity to park <b>and</b> <b>ride.</b> Congestion has remained persistent in the cities studied and there is concern that total travel may have been increased rather than reduced, which was the intention. It is concluded that, for park <b>and</b> <b>ride</b> to be successful, 'package' policies will need to be strengthened to favour conventional public transport and that particular care will need to be taken by other local authorities adopting park <b>and</b> <b>ride.</b> ...|$|R
