25|$|On March 15, Herreraâ€™s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> the closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers threw down their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|Roberts backed {{a pickup}} truck {{up to the front}} of the Amish schoolhouse and entered the school at {{approximately}} 10:25a.m. EDT, shortly after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said that Roberts was mumbling his words and was not making direct eye contact. After the occupants of the classroom denied seeing a clevis pin, Roberts walked out to his truck and reappeared in the classroom holding a Springfield XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the back of his pickup. Zook and her mother, who was visiting the schoolhouse, took this opportunity to escape the school <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> a nearby farm to get help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if the women got away.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{minutes after}} Michigan's touchdown, Allerdice {{lined up to}} punt from Michigan's 15-yard line. [...] The snap from center went over his head, and Marquette {{recovered}} the ball at the two-yard line. [...] Marquette scored on its third attempt, but Marquette's right halfback Munsell missed the extra point, and Michigan led 6-5. In the second half, Michigan played a defensive game, punting the ball at [...] "almost every opportunity." [...] Ring Lardner reported that Michigan's coach [...] "evidently had instructed Allerdice to play a kicking game," [...] and the team [...] "appeared loathe to try its offense." [...] Late in the second half, Michigan narrowly preserved its lead after a field goal attempt by Allerdice was blocked at the Marquette 45-yard line. [...] Marquette's fullback, Schroeder, picked up the ball <b>and</b> <b>ran</b> <b>toward</b> Michigan's goal [...] "with a clear field before him." [...] Lawton ran after Schroder and made a leaping tackle that saved the game for Michigan.|$|E
