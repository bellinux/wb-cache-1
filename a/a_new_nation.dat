5|$|San Martín {{thought that}} if he joined forces with Bolívar {{he would be able}} to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru. Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Martín {{appointed}} Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bolivar was unable to meet San Martín at the arranged date, so San Martín returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bolívar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions on the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>nation.</b> Bolívar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Martín to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.|$|E
5|$|The war, lasting under a fortnight, {{saw more}} than 90,000 Pakistani {{soldiers}} taken as {{prisoners of war}} (POWs), and it ended with the unconditional surrender of Pakistan's eastern half, resulting in the birth of Bangladesh as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>nation.</b> Apart from the POWs, Pakistan lost six thousand men, while India lost two thousand. After the war, Manekshaw {{was known for his}} compassion towards the POWs. Singh recounts that in some cases he addressed POWs personally, talking to them privately with just his aide-de-camp in his company while they shared a cup of tea. He ensured that POWs were well treated by the Indian Army, making provisions for them to be supplied with the copies of the Quran, and allowing them to celebrate festivals, and to receive letters and parcels from their loved ones.|$|E

25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>nation</b> - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so he is probably not the historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the butterfly effect.|$|E
25|$|May 30, 1630, Captain Squib of {{the ship}} Mary and John entered Boston Harbor and on June 17, 1630, landed a boat with eight men on the Dorchester shore, at {{what was then a}} narrow {{peninsula}} known as Mattapan or Mattaponnock, and today is known as Columbia Point (more popularly since 1984 as Harbor Point).

He achieved his aims but only at the price of his own popularity. His subjects admired and feared him, but did not love him. His execution of two young heroes for a trifling breach of discipline after the conclusion of his Nanzhao campaign angered people, and to appease them he declared that the two dead heroes were now gods who could be worshipped. His forcing of Kyansittha to become fugitive increased his popularity although this action at least was justified for the great paladin, like the Lancelot of the Round Table, was in love with one of his queens.|$|E
