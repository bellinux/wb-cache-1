40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an online technique for detecting out-of-step operation of interconnected power systems based on instantaneous <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> relaying. The instantaneous <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> {{seen by the}} relay {{as well as the}} peak values of the voltage and current signals at the relay location are highly influenced by the actual system frequency. Prony analysis is used to track the actual system frequencies by decomposing the measured voltage and current signals to its modal components: amplitude, frequency, damping factor and phase angle. Once the actual system modes are predicted, the instantaneous <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> seen by the relay is calculated. The simulation results show that loci of the instantaneous <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> are effective and reliable in predicting and describing the behavior of the system during out-of-step operation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for power system {{stability}} analysis is introduced. The method is based on injection of a small voltage or current in an arbitrary point of a power system. The <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> is then defined as the ratio between the voltage and current at the injection point. It is shown that the <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the eigenvalues of the system that are observable from the injection point. The eigenvalues are obtained by applying system identifi- cation techniques to the measured set of <b>apparent</b> <b>impedances.</b> The method is similar to the well established impedance-based stability analysis based on source and load impedance models. However, while the source/load impedance ratio is viewed as the minor-loop gain, the <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> {{can be viewed as a}} closed-loop transfer function. It can also be expressed as the parallel connection of the source and load impedance. It is shown in the paper how the system eigenvalues can be extracted based on a set of <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> values. The <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> holds therefore complementary information compared with the existing impedance-based stability analysis. The method can also be used as a tool to validate analytically derived state-space models. In this paper the method is presented as a simulation tool, while further work will extend it to include experimental setups. Two case-studies are presented to illustrate the method. 1) A DC-case with a buck converter feeding a constant power load, and 2) a three-phase grid-connected VSC with current controller and PLL.

40|$|Passivity {{has been}} a major {{criterion}} for designing a stable haptic interface due to its numerous advantages. However, passivity-based controllers have suffered from the design conservatism of the passivity criterion, particularly when users want to increase the maximum <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance.</b> Based on the input-to-state stable (ISS) criterion and an analogy between haptic interfaces and systems with hysteresis, this paper proposes a control framework that is less conservative than passivity-based controllers. The proposed ISS approach allows a non-predetermined finite amount of output energy to be extracted from the system. Therefore, the proposed method can increase the maximum <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> compared with passivity-based approaches. The focus of this paper is on how the proposed approach is designed to satisfy the input-to-state stability criterion in real time without prior knowledge of the system. This paper also extends the primary single-port ISS approach to a two-port ISS approach for multiple-degree-of-freedom generalization. The experimental and numerical results demonstrate that the proposed ISS approach is able to stabilize a higher impedance range than the time-domain passivity approach. The experimental results also confirm that the proposed approach provides higher actual <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> to the operator compared with the energy-bounding and force-bounding approaches...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method for power system {{stability}} analysis is introduced. The method is based on injection of a small voltage or current in an arbitrary point of the system. The <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> {{is defined as the}} ratio between the voltage and current in the injection point. It is shown that the <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> can be used to estimate the eigenvalues of the system that are observable from the injection point. The eigenvalues are obtained by applying the Vector Fitting algorithm to the measured set of <b>apparent</b> <b>impedances.</b> The proposed method holds some advantages over the well established impedance-based analysis method: It is no longer needed to estimate the source and load impedance equivalents separately, and {{it is not necessary to}} make any assumption regarding where the source and load are located. This reduces the required measurements and data processing. Furthermore, the stability analysis is global in the sense that the resulting stability margin does not depend on the injection point location. Finally, the method is well suited for real-time implementation due to low computational requirements.

50|$|Distance {{protection}} detects both voltage and current. A fault on {{a circuit}} will generally create a sag in the voltage level. If {{the ratio of}} voltage to current measured at the relay terminals, which equates to an impedance, lands within a predetermined level the circuit breaker will operate. This is useful for reasonable length lines, lines longer than 10 miles, because its operating characteristics {{are based on the}} line characteristics. This means that when a fault appears on the line the impedance setting in the relay is compared to the <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> of the line from the relay terminals to the fault. If the relay setting is determined to be below the <b>apparent</b> <b>impedance</b> it is determined that the fault is within the zone of protection. When the transmission line length is too short, less than 10 miles, distance protection becomes more difficult to coordinate. In these instances the best choice of protection is current differential protection.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to propose a new {{monitoring}} technique for traditional distribution system with integration of renewable energy source. The traditional distribution network is primarily composed of radial feeders, designed for unidirectional power flow. Therefore, many operation regulation, protection and control system, in distribution network, {{are based on the}} radial distribution systems assumption. The high penetration of the renewable energy sources, will clearly impact the distribution systems operation. Unlike other ways of electricity generation renewable energies initiate some challenges for grid operation. Intermittency of renewable energies sources, power system protection, stability, security, economic dispatch, optimal power flow are critical issues initiated by renewable energies penetration to power systems. In addition, the renewable energy source output may exceed the consumed power during the day. Therefore, the direction of the power flow can be reversed during some periods. The high penetration of decentralized renewable sources will create a multidirectional power flow condition in the distribution grid, which was originally designed for unidirectional power flow only. Following of this reverse power flow, the distribution feeder voltage rises. In this thesis the necessity of online monitoring system for important feeders in distribution system will be shown.
