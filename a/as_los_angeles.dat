5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the changes}} made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the police cars; the {{original}} colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the New York City Police Department. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and San Francisco. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, {{as well as some}} changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{was one of}} {{the major}} cities that benefited from {{programs}} such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA. The workers, mostly men, built roads, parks, dams, schools, railroads, bridges, docks, and even historical and archival record sites and buildings. However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.|$|E

5|$|The 767-200 was the {{original}} model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982. The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 44 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in commercial service as of July 2016. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.|$|E
5|$|The Denver MSA has a gross {{metropolitan}} {{product of}} $157.6 billion in 2010, {{making it the}} 18th largest metro economy in the United States. Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection {{to some of the}} country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within , it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the Mountain States, Southwest states, as well as all western states. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the Midwest, such as Chicago and St. Louis and some large cities of the West Coast, such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàles casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique and distinct looks, which was trying <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E

5|$|In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, {{and found}} that some {{employees}} had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants {{as a result of}} the audit, resulting in protests by local groups. In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C. which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and Atlanta. In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.|$|E
5|$|In late 1991, {{the group}} had the problem of having spent more money on {{production}} than was covered by returns. The group decided that its gangsta rap style was the cause: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, {{making it difficult for}} Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically. Referring to local rapper Esham's horrorcore style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about Satan, which Esham often did.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was filmed in various {{locations}} in Albuquerque and Portland. Among the areas filmed included the Rio Grande, junkyards, and near Mercer's home. The clip {{was directed by}} Lance Bangs, an associate of Spike Jonze. It features the band re-enacting the cover art of other bands' albums, including Zen Arcade and New Day Rising by Hüsker Dü, Let It Be by The Replacements, Moon Pix by Cat Power, Double Nickels on the Dime by The Minutemen, Squirrel Bait's first EP, Sonic Youth's Sister and Slint's Spiderland. Shooting in just two cities created logistical problems for album covers originally photographed in cities such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> Minneapolis, and Louisville. For the homage to Double Nickels on the Dime, the band had {{to track down the}} exact model of the car featured on the album cover (a Volkswagen Beetle), and Albuquerque happened to have a San Pedro Street, which is featured on a freeway sign on the original cover.|$|E

5|$|The Los Angeles Dodgers {{were the}} National League's No. 1 seed {{by virtue of}} the best record {{entering}} the playoffs; thus, the Phillies traveled to Chavez Ravine for the opener of the playoffs' second round, the fifth postseason meeting between the two clubs. James Loney opened the scoring for the Dodgers with a solo home run {{in the bottom of the}} second inning, but the Phillies answered back with a five-run fifth inning, chasing starter Clayton Kershaw. Manny Ramírez' two-run home run in the bottom of the inning made the score 5–4, but Raúl Ibañez followed with a three-run home run in the top of the eighth. Lidge, appearing in his third consecutive postseason game, notched his third consecutive save. Martínez started the second game for the Phillies, throwing 7 scoreless innings on 87 pitches. After his departure, the Phillies used five bullpen pitchers to get three outs in the eighth inning; those pitchers allowed three hits and two walks, allowing two runs to score. Jonathan Broxton saved the second game for the Dodgers, <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> won, 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community {{in the weeks and months}} after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such <b>as</b> <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E
