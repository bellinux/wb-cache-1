5|$|The N3 center {{consists}} of three nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. Its concentration is <b>always</b> <b>just</b> {{a fraction of the}} A and B centers. The N3 center is paramagnetic, so its structure is well justified from the analysis of the EPR spectrum P2. This defect produces a characteristic absorption and luminescence line at 415nm and thus does not induce color on its own. However, the N3 center is always accompanied by the N2 center, having an absorption line at 478nm (and no luminescence). As a result, diamonds rich in N3/N2 centers are yellow in color.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively {{describe}} Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible ΔVs instead of <b>always</b> <b>just</b> one in a realistic situation.|$|E

The young are thought to leave the nest eight weeks after hatching.The breeding season has been given as April and May, though it may well vary across the large range of this species.|$|E
25|$|He {{also wrote}} several more pseudonymous books in 1844: Philosophical Fragments, Prefaces and The Concept of Anxiety and {{finished}} the year up with Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication {{in the rest of}} them. He doesn't believe the question about God's existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it's up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are <b>always</b> <b>just</b> possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God's attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were <b>always</b> <b>just</b> and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E

500|$|The {{questions}} of what defines film noir, {{and what sort}} of category it is, provoke continuing debate. [...] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel"—this set of attributes constitutes the first of many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953 (A Panorama of American Film Noir), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an [...] "elusive phenomenon <b>always</b> <b>just</b> out of reach".|$|E
