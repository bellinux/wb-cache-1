5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of oil shale in Estonia, both of which are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic <b>argillite</b> is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of a coupled elastoplastic damage constitutive model for <b>argillites</b> is presented. Emphasis is put on the description of post-failure and coupled hydromechanical behavior of <b>argillites</b> during the desaturation/resaturation processes. A short summary of experimental investigations is given in the first part, which shows an important plastic deformation coupled with damage and a significant influence of water content on the mechanical behavior of <b>argillites.</b> Based on the framework of poroplasticity and continuum damage mechanics, a general constitutive model is proposed for the poromechanical behavior of <b>argillites</b> in both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Main features observed in experiments are taken into account, in particular the elastic degradation due to microcracks, residual strength, coupling between plastic deformation and induced damage, influence of water content on plastic flow, variation of permeability induced by microcracks {{as well as the}} deformation generated in the desaturation/resaturation processes. The performance of the model is examined by comparing numerical simulations with test data in representative load paths. Finally, the model is applied to hydromechanical coupling study of four time-dependent tests subjected to a step change in relative humidity...|$|R

40|$|Provenance in {{the lower}} Belt-Purcell Supergroup is {{constrained}} based on geochemical systematics and chemical monazite ages of <b>argillites</b> and sandstones. Rare earth element (REE), Cr-Ni, and Th/Sc-Sc systematics is equivalent for both facies and consistent with a dominantly post-Archean source area. Detrital monazite chemical ages restrict major provenance for the Appekunny and Grinnell sandstones and <b>argillites</b> to Paleoproterozoic terranes at ~ 1800 - 1600 Ma, minor contributions at ~ 1600 - 1500 Ma, and marginal contributions from Archean terranes at ~ 2600, likely in Laurentia. Similar detrital age spectra for monazites of <b>argillites</b> and sandstones of the Appekunny Formation are consistent with a common provenance for the two facies. The Belt-Purcell sequence records three major diagenetic stages displayed in <b>argillites</b> and sandstones: (1) K-addition and rare earth element post-Archean upper continental crust (PA-UCC) -like pattern; (2) a stage characterized by heavy REE enrichment relative to light REE and HFSE fractionation, and U and Ce mobility; and (3) local dolomitization with REE and high field strenght elements (HFSE) mobility. REE and HFSE mobility are interpreted {{as the result of}} oxidized alkaline brines developed by dissolution of evaporites. Monazites from the Appekunny and Grinnell formations differ compositionally and texturally in two groups. Rounded or inclusions with ages >~ 1400 Ma, interpreted as detrital, have higher Th 2 O, Y 2 O 3 and lower LREE/HREE contents than euhedral individual monazite grains with chemical age...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA set of {{regularly}} spaced specimens, {{made up of}} dark-coloured calcareous <b>argillites,</b> {{were collected}} from borehole-cores from the Early Callovian up to the Middle Oxfordian, in the eastern Paris Basin. These specimens have been studied for their magnetic susceptibility, natural and artificial remanence, and for their anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. Compared with sulfate, carbonate and iron contents, these magnetic properties provide information on both the nature and the relative amounts of the constitutive minerals. To a first approximation, these data outline the main end-members of these <b>argillites,</b> namely (i) carbonate-enriched and less susceptible, (ii) clay-enriched and more susceptible, and (iii) more remanent and {{partly due to the}} silt fraction. The middle of the Callovo-Oxfordian formation, called the maximum clay zone, is marked by the highest recorded susceptibility, mainly due to the paramagnetic iron-bearing clay minerals, and by a rather low remanence. The anisotropy of susceptibility provides information on the petrofabric of mostly the clay fraction. The fabric is highly planar, in agreement with the subhorizontal preferred orientation of the clay platelets, but the always present linear anisotropy of the <b>argillites,</b> although modest in strength, points to similar to north-south trending directions throughout most of the formation.

Three buttes south of Great Falls are major landmarks: Cascade, Crown, Square, Shaw and Buttes. Known as laccoliths, they formed when igneous rock protruded through cracks in the sedimentary rock. The underlying surface consists of sandstone and shale. Surface soils {{in the area are}} highly diverse, and greatly affected by the local geology, whether glaciated plain, intermountain basin, mountain foothills, or tableland. Foothill regions are often covered in weathered stone or broken slate, or consist of uncovered bare rock (usually igneous, quartzite, sandstone, or shale). The soil of intermountain basins usually consists of clay, gravel, sand, silt, and volcanic ash, much of it laid down by lakes which covered the region during the Oligocene 33 to 23 million years ago. Tablelands are often topped with <b>argillite</b> gravel and weathered quartzite, occasionally underlain by shale. The glaciated plains are generally covered in clay, gravel, sand, and silt left by the proglacial Lake Great Falls or by moraines or gravel-covered former lake basins left by the Wisconsin glaciation 85,000 to 11,000 years ago.
