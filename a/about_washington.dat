500|$|To support Fort Stanton and its two {{subsidiary}} positions, {{a military}} road was constructed from Uniontown to the fort. Tributary roads led from Fort Stanton {{to the other}} forts in the Eastern Branch line. These roads were eventually widened into a large ring road that circled most of the 37-mile perimeter of Washington, a fact that can be noted in the 1865 map of the city's defenses. In fall 1862, however, the commission examining the defenses noted that [...] "the work on roads <b>about</b> <b>Washington</b> requires ten regiments for twenty days ... or an equivalent of labor in some other shape." ...|$|E

500|$|Free of {{political}} obligations, Everett traveled {{the country with}} his family, giving public speeches. [...] One cause he took up was the preservation of George Washington's home at Mount Vernon. [...] Over several years in the mid-1850s he toured, speaking <b>about</b> <b>Washington</b> (whom he compared favorably to Frederick the Great and the Duke of Marlborough). [...] Not only did Everett donate the proceeds from this touring (about $70,000), he also refused to deduct his travel expenses. [...] He also agreed to write a weekly column for the New York Ledger {{in exchange for a}} $10,000 gift to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. [...] These columns were eventually bound and sold as the Mount Vernon Papers.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post Stuever {{has many}} {{complaints}} about the show {{including the fact that}} it is <b>about</b> <b>Washington,</b> DC, but filmed in Baltimore. He also complains about its entrance into the television landscape littered with [...] "more fictitious administrations than anyone can keep track of". He says that perspective will affect your perception of the show. Those not already inundated with [...] "Type A personalities inside the Beltway" [...] in their daily lives may be drawn to the show. However, it is not likely a show that will serve well those who spend a lot of time with the issues that the show deals with. After viewing the first two episodes, Stuever also finds fault with the use of breaking the fourth wall, describing it as [...] "the show's unwise narrative trope". The Wall Street Journal Smith defends the fourth wall as an [...] "artifice that generally works well here to loosen our bearings".|$|E

2500|$|When Washington and {{his troops}} encamped at Valley Forge {{in the winter}} of 1777–1778, Henry {{arranged}} for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called Conway Cabal. Henry supported Washington when Dr. Benjamin Rush of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>Washington,</b> sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. [...] Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush's handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, [...] "I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time".|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen-year-old Stanley Williams was {{approached}} by Raymond Washington {{in the spring of}} 1971, at Washington Preparatory High School. Washington was from the East Side of South Central, while Williams was from the West Side of that area. A mutual friend of both young men informed Washington of Williams' toughness and his willingness to fight members of larger, more established street gangs like the L.A. Brims and the Chain Gang (both gangs would later become Bloods sets; The Brims and The Inglewood Family Bloods respectively). According to Williams' account of his initial meeting with Washington, what struck him <b>about</b> <b>Washington</b> was that, besides being incredibly muscular, Washington and his cohort were dressed similar to Williams and his clique (leather jackets with starched Levi's jeans and suspenders). [...] Williams had befriended so many clique leaders and street thugs on the West Side, he and a few others formed what would become the West Side Crips.|$|E

60|$|The {{evacuation}} of Corinth and our delay by the flood in the Chickahominy have enabled the enemy to concentrate too much force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there {{soon will be}} no substantial rebel force anywhere else. But if we send all the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will, before we can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take Washington. Or if {{a large part of}} the western army be brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, etc. What should be done is to hold what we have in the West, open the Mississippi, and take Chattanooga and East Tennessee without more. A reasonable force should in every event be kept <b>about</b> <b>Washington</b> for its protection. Then let the country give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which, added to McClellan directly or indirectly, will take Richmond without endangering any other place which we now hold, and will substantially end the war. I expect to maintain this contest until successful, or till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsake me; and I would publicly appeal to the country for this new force were it not that I fear a general panic and stampede would follow, so hard it is to have a thing understood as it really is. I think the new force should be all, or nearly all, infantry, principally because such can be raised most cheaply and quickly.|$|E
60|$|Your {{despatch}} of Tuesday morning induces me to {{hope your}} army is having some rest. In this hope {{allow me to}} reason with you a moment. When you ask for 50,000 men to be promptly sent you, you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing your disposal of forces made last spring {{for the defense of}} WASHINGTON, and advising a return to that plan. I find it included in and <b>about</b> <b>WASHINGTON</b> 75,000 men. Now, please be assured I have not men enough to fill that very plan by 15,000. All of Fremont's in the valley, all of Banks's, all of McDowell's not with you, and all in WASHINGTON, taken together, do not exceed, if they reach, 60,000. With Wool and Dix added to those mentioned, I have not, outside of your army, 75,000 men east of the mountains. Thus the idea of sending you 50,000, or any other considerable force, promptly, is simply absurd. If, in your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the impression that I blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of such impression. I only beg that in like manner you will not ask impossibilities of me. If you think you are not strong enough to take Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the army, material and personal, and I will strengthen it for the offensive again as fast as I can. The governors of eighteen States offer me a new levy of 300,000, which I accept.|$|E
60|$|These wards {{are either}} {{lettered}} alphabetically, Ward G, Ward K, or else numerically, 1, 2, 3, etc. Each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course there is, in the aggregate, quite a muster of employees, and {{over all the}} surgeon in charge. Any one of these hospitals is a little city in itself. Take, for instance, the Carver hospital, {{out a couple of}} miles, on a hill, northern part of Fourteenth street. It has more inmates than an ordinary country town. The same with the Lincoln hospital, east of the Capitol, or the Finley hospital, on high grounds northeast of the city; both large establishments. Armory-square hospital, under Dr. Bliss, in Seventh street (one of the best anywhere), is also temporarily enlarged this summer, with additional tents, sheds, etc. It must have nearly a hundred tents, wards, sheds, and structures of one kind and another. The worst cases are always to be found here. A wanderer like me <b>about</b> <b>Washington</b> pauses on some high land which commands the sweep of the city (one never tires of the noble and ample views presented here, in the generally fine, soft, peculiar air and light), and has his eyes attracted by these white clusters of barracks in almost every direction. They make a great show in the landscape, and I often use them as landmarks. Some of these clusters are very full of inmates. Counting the whole, with the convalescent camps (whose inmates are often worse off than the sick in the hospitals), they have numbered, in this quarter and just down the Potomac, as high as fifty thousand invalid, disabled, or sick and dying men.|$|E
