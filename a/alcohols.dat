40|$|<b>Alcohol</b> use {{disorder}} (AUD) {{is characterized}} by excessive <b>alcohol</b> use and persistent <b>alcohol</b> seeking despite knowledge of its negative consequences. Importantly, AUD typically develops after chronic excessive <b>alcohol</b> use in a subgroup of individuals who drink <b>alcohol,</b> suggesting that AUD results from an interaction between individual vulnerability and prolonged <b>alcohol</b> exposure. The present study assessed the contribution of prolonged exposure to <b>alcohol</b> and individual levels of <b>alcohol</b> intake {{to the development of}} loss of control over <b>alcohol</b> seeking in a conditioned suppression model. To investigate the impact of prolonged <b>alcohol</b> exposure, conditioned suppression of <b>alcohol</b> seeking was assessed after 2 and 4 months of intermittent <b>alcohol</b> access (IAA) in a subgroup of rats drinking moderate amounts of <b>alcohol.</b> We observed that suppression of <b>alcohol</b> seeking was reduced after 4 months compared with 2 months of IAA. The influence of individual levels of <b>alcohol</b> intake on loss of control over <b>alcohol</b> seeking was subsequently determined by assessing conditioned suppression in subgroups of low and high <b>alcohol</b> drinking rats. Unlike the low <b>alcohol</b> drinking rats, the high <b>alcohol</b> drinking rats showed aversion-resistant <b>alcohol</b> seeking after 2 months of IAA, although both groups showed comparable levels of conditioned freezing. These findings show that the development of loss of control over <b>alcohol</b> seeking, a key characteristic of AUD in humans, is dependent on both the extent of <b>alcohol</b> exposure and the individual's propensity to consume <b>alcohol...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Most alcoholics {{experience}} {{periods of}} voluntary <b>alcohol</b> abstinence or imposed <b>alcohol</b> deprivation {{followed by a}} return to <b>alcohol</b> drinking. This study examined whether varenicline (VAR) reduces <b>alcohol</b> intake during a return to drinking after periods of <b>alcohol</b> deprivation in rats selectively bred for high <b>alcohol</b> drinking (the <b>alcohol</b> preferring or “P” rats). Methods Alcohol-experienced P rats were given 24 -hour access to food and water and scheduled access to <b>alcohol</b> (15 % and 30 % v/v) for 2 h/d. After 4 weeks, rats were deprived of <b>alcohol</b> for 2 weeks, followed by reaccess to <b>alcohol</b> for 2 weeks, and this pattern was repeated {{for a total of}} 3 cycles. Rats were fed either vehicle (VEH) or VAR, in doses of 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 mg/kg BW, at 1 hour prior to onset of the daily <b>alcohol</b> reaccess period for the first 5 days of each of the 3 <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycles. Results Low-dose VAR (0. 5 mg/kg BW) reduced <b>alcohol</b> intake during the 5 days of drug treatment in <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycles 1 and 2. Higher doses of VAR (1. 0 mg/kg BW and 2. 0 mg/kg BW) reduced <b>alcohol</b> intake during the 5 days of treatment in all 3 <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycles. The decrease in <b>alcohol</b> intake disappeared with termination of VAR treatment in all <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycles. Conclusions The results demonstrate that VAR decreases <b>alcohol</b> intake during multiple cycles of <b>alcohol</b> reaccess following <b>alcohol</b> deprivation in rats and suggests that it may prevent a return to heavy <b>alcohol</b> drinking during a lapse from <b>alcohol</b> abstinence in humans with <b>alcohol</b> use disorder...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Alcohol</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used psychoactive substances. Prolonged <b>alcohol</b> use can result in <b>alcohol</b> use disorder (AUD), characterized by excessive and compulsive <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Importantly, however, the development of AUD only happens in a minority of individuals who consume <b>alcohol.</b> To understand the individual vulnerability for AUD, models that capture both the individual variability in <b>alcohol</b> consumption and the transition from casual to compulsive <b>alcohol</b> use are essential. METHODS: Individual variability in voluntary <b>alcohol</b> intake and the preference for <b>alcohol</b> were assessed under continuous <b>alcohol</b> access (CAA) and intermittent-every-other-day <b>alcohol</b> access (IAA) schedules in the home cage using outbred Lister Hooded rats. Subsequently, the reinforcing properties of <b>alcohol</b> were tested in an operant setting. In subsequent experiments, we performed a quinine adulteration experiment to assess inflexible <b>alcohol</b> consumption and blood <b>alcohol</b> levels (BALs) were assessed after voluntary <b>alcohol</b> consumption. RESULTS: We found marked individual differences in <b>alcohol</b> consumption and preference under both access schedules, whereby subgroups of high- and low-alcohol-drinking rats (HD and LD) could be identified. HD with IAA increased their <b>alcohol</b> intake over days in the first month, whereas LD did not. Moreover, when <b>alcohol</b> access time was extended from 7 to 24 h/d for rats with IAA, <b>alcohol</b> intake profoundly increased in HD with IAA, whereas LD with IAA maintained low levels of <b>alcohol</b> intake. Furthermore, HD earned more <b>alcohol</b> than LD under both fixed ratio and progressive ratio schedules of reinforcement. We further found that HD continued their intake of a quinine-adulterated <b>alcohol</b> solution to a larger extent than LD and HD showed higher BALs after 30 minutes of <b>alcohol</b> consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These profound individual differences in <b>alcohol</b> intake, reinforcement, motivation, and AUD-like behavior provide a promising tool to unravel the neurobehavioral underpinnings of individual vulnerability for AUD...|$|R

Method: A community sample of 355 individuals completed measures of <b>alcohol</b> expectancies, metacognitive beliefs about <b>alcohol</b> use, and drinking behaviour. Results: Correlation analyses indicated that <b>alcohol</b> expectancies and metacognitive beliefs about <b>alcohol</b> use were positively correlated with drinking behaviour. Structural regression modelling revealed that three of the four facets of metacognitive beliefs about <b>alcohol</b> use were independent contributors to drinking behaviour, and that, when controlling for such beliefs, only negative social performance <b>alcohol</b> expectancies explained additional variance in drinking behaviour. Conclusions: These results add to the argument that there is a value in differentiating between metacognitive beliefs about <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>alcohol</b> expectancies in predicting drinking behaviour...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many alcoholics {{and heavy}} {{drinkers}} undergo repeated cycles of <b>alcohol</b> abstinence followed by relapse to <b>alcohol</b> drinking; {{a pattern that}} contributes to escalated <b>alcohol</b> intake over time. In rodents, <b>alcohol</b> drinking that is interspersed with periods of <b>alcohol</b> deprivation (imposed abstinence) increases <b>alcohol</b> intake during reaccess to <b>alcohol.</b> This is termed the "alcohol deprivation effect" or "ADE" and {{is a model of}} <b>alcohol</b> relapse in humans. We have previously reported that prazosin reduces <b>alcohol</b> drinking during both brief and prolonged treatment in rats selectively bred for <b>alcohol</b> preference ("P" rats). This study explores whether prazosin prevents <b>alcohol</b> "relapse" in P rats, as reflected by a reduced or abolished ADE. METHODS: Adult male P rats were given 24 -hour access to food and water and scheduled access to <b>alcohol</b> (15 and 30 % v/v solutions presented concurrently) for 2 h/d. After 5 weeks, rats underwent imposed <b>alcohol</b> deprivation for 2 weeks, followed by <b>alcohol</b> reaccess for 2 weeks, and this pattern was repeated for a total of 3 cycles. Rats were injected with prazosin (0, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneally) once a day for the first 5 days of each <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycle. RESULTS: <b>Alcohol</b> intake increased {{on the first day of}} each <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycle, demonstrating the formation of an ADE. The ADE was short-lived, lasting only 1 day, during each of the 3 cycles. Prazosin, in all doses tested, prevented the expression of an ADE in all 3 <b>alcohol</b> reaccess cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Prazosin decreases <b>alcohol</b> intake in P rats even in a situation that would be expected to increase <b>alcohol</b> drinking, namely following periods of <b>alcohol</b> deprivation. This suggests that prazosin may be effective in reducing <b>alcohol</b> relapse that often occurs during attempts to achieve permanent <b>alcohol</b> abstinence in treatment-seeking alcoholics and heavy drinkers...|$|R
