5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E
5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez had helped her escape and then killed her.|$|E
5|$|Toyo Miyatake, who {{was born}} in Kagawa, Shikoku, Japan, in 1896, immigrated to the United States in 1909. He settled in the Little Tokyo section of Los Angeles, and was incarcerated at Manzanar along with his family. A photographer, Miyatake smuggled a lens and film holder into Manzanar and later had a {{craftsman}} construct a wooden box with <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> hid the lens. He took many now-famous photos of life and the conditions at Manzanar. His contraband camera was eventually discovered by the camp administration and confiscated. However, camp director Ralph Merritt later allowed Miyatake to photograph freely within the camp, even though he was not allowed to actually press the shutter button, requiring a guard or camp official to perform this simple task. Merritt finally saw no point to this technicality, and allowed Miyatake to take photos.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot {{made her}} way to the village of Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, where she was either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken to one of the bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run from the top of the masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E

25|$|Slytherin's locket {{was passed}} {{down through the}} generations and {{eventually}} {{ended up in the}} possession of Merope Gaunt. After being abandoned by her husband Tom Riddle Sr., Merope sold the locket to Caractacus Burke, shopkeeper of Borgin & Burkes, for 10 Galleons, {{a small fraction of the}} locket's true value. The locket was eventually sold to Hepzibah Smith. Riddle stole the locket, along with Helga Hufflepuff's cup, after murdering Smith. Once the locket became a Horcrux, Voldemort hid it in a seaside cave where he had once terrorised two of his fellow orphans. The cave's magical protection included <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> could only be opened with a blood offering, an enchanted boat, a basin of potion that causes pain and horrific visions to the drinker, and the use of Inferi. Dumbledore and Harry Potter pursued the locket in The Half-Blood Prince only to find a fake one at the bottom of the basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} palace {{consisted of}} two sections, a southern and a northern. The southern one, inaccessible to the public today, featured the large apsed hexagonal hall which was later converted into the Church of Saint Euphemia, connected to a wide semicircular portico, some 60m in diameter and enclosing a courtyard paved with marble. The hexagonal hall originally served probably as a dining hall (triclinium). The diameter of the hall is some 20m, with {{each side of the}} hexagon 10.4m wide. Each side featured an absidal niche, polygonal on the exterior and semicircular in the interior, each 7.65m wide and 4.65m deep, thus providing space for a semicircular bench (sigma or stibadium) and a dining table. Each apse also had <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> communicated with small circular rooms, situated between the apses. A marble pool was located {{in the center of the}} hall, a feature common in Late Antiquity. The hexagonal triclinium was flanked by other rooms, grouped along the outer curve of the great portico, including an elaborate vestibule with a circular room at its center.|$|E

Dressed in an entirely black attire, Shakira then appears singing the song with a mic stand in a snowy forest setting. She is backed by a four-piece band of musicians, who are also wearing black costumes. As the first chorus of the song ends, it start to snow. In a maze-like structure, Shakira is shown running in a large golden frock, trying to find her way. Changing back to the forest setting, the camera pans upward to reveal that the maze is built behind the wall in front of which Shakira and her band are performing. The song's bridge co-indices with the {{occurrence}} of a storm and culminates with Shakira tearing her top open, after which the sun rises and the intensity of the lighting increases.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{reviewing}} the episode for TrekNation was undecided {{about whether the}} main point of the episode where Captain Archer is expected to lead the Vulcans back to their main path of logic was a [...] "wonderfully progressive concept or just regressive Trek in which humans have all the answers". She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that {{the other members of}} the main cast didn't get a great deal to do in the episode. However, whilst she thought that [...] "Awakening" [...] was a visual improvement over [...] "The Forge", she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that certain elements of the plot didn't follow logical paths, such as how Archer found the Kir'shara in a few minutes when apparently the Syrrannites had been looking for it for two years even though [...] "it sits in a chamber behind <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> practically announces, 'IMPORTANT RELIC INSIDE'?"

Arthur knocked out power to more than 290,000individuals in the Maritimes; 144,000of those were customers of Nova Scotia Power (NSP), and 1,500of Maritime Electric on Prince Edward Island. In New Brunswick, power outages affected upwards of 140,000individuals, of which 52,000were situated near Fredericton, forcing {{the closure of the}} local University of New Brunswick campus. Copious rainfall was recorded in southwestern parts of New Brunswick, with [...] measured at Gagetown. Flooding at Saint John, New Brunswick made two local streets inaccessible, while winds downed electrical poles in Fredericton. In Onslow, Nova Scotia, firefighters rescued a man trapped under a tree limb, while a sailboat capsized at Charlottetown harbor and another was washed out to sea. The hurricane forced temporary suspension of the MV Nova Star ferry service between Yarmouth, Nova Scotia and Portland, Maine. The storm caused flight delays and cancellations at Halifax Stanfield International Airport, while LaHave and Tancook Island ferries were shut down; in addition, access to the A. Murray MacKay Bridge was restricted to smaller vehicles. In Stratford, Prince Edward Island, a woman died after being struck by <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> was caught by a gust of wind, and in Woodstock, New Brunswick, a man died when his oxygen support was cut off during a power outage.

2500|$|A {{generation}} later, the Irish Anglican bishop, George Berkeley (1685–1753), {{determined that}} Locke's view immediately opened <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>that</b> {{would lead to}} eventual atheism. In response to Locke, he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either {{as a result of}} their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.) [...] In his text Alciphron, Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.
