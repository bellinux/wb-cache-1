25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} often {{employed}} for extremely deep dives when breathing mixes containing helium are used. Helium conducts heat much {{more efficiently than}} air, {{which means that the}} diver will lose large quantities of body heat through the lungs when breathing it. This fact compounds the risk of hypothermia already present in the cold temperatures found at these depths. Under these conditions a hot water suit is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival,</b> not comfort. Just as an emergency backup source of breathing gas is required, a backup water heater is also an essential precaution whenever dive conditions warrant a hot water suit. If the heater fails and a backup unit cannot be immediately brought online, a diver in the coldest conditions can die within minutes; depending on decompression obligations, bringing the diver directly to the surface could prove equally deadly.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} Seiffen started when miners {{opened up the}} {{district}} 700 years ago. With the recession of ore mining in the area, Seiffen turned to wooden toy manufacture as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>survival.</b> In 1699, Seiffen resident Johann Friedrich Hiemann took Seiffen toys to market at Nuremberg. Nuremberg was a toy distribution market for much of Europe at that time. Seiffen was able to break into this large toy market thanks to two factors. First, the low cost of living and economic depression in the Ore Mountains allowed prices {{much lower than the}} rest of European toy manufacturers selling at the Nuremberg market. Second, the high quality of toys being produced in Seiffen.|$|R

Considering the fact that continuous advocacy and representation is needed to represent non-humans (who will never speak for themselves), we need to push justice debate beyond academic compounds.

If animal life had been placed on an existential par with human life – or animals have been recognized as subjects of their lives – then their exploitation and that of their homelands would have been rendered morally unfeasible (Crist 2013).|$|R

40|$|Recycling {{organic waste}} has become <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> utmost {{importance}} for overall healthiness of the Earth, its volume largely {{interacting with the}} economic development. The problem tends to become <b>a</b> vital <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> for <b>an</b> entire society. In this context, recovery, recycling, physical-chemical treatment, composting or incineration are methods of waste processing, commonly used in most countries of the world. These measures are intended to both environmental protection and rational use and economically efficient. Based on the data regarding the municipal waste generated in Mures County, in previous years, and in Tg-Mures city, in 2007 were calculated the quantities expected to generate by the year 2038. Also, concerning the cleaning recovery it is proposed the pile composting method, being, {{from our point of}} view, more beneficial in the area. In conclusion, at county level but at city level too, there is still working to do, primarily in terms of awareness, not only the population but also the relevant, local bodies, of what means the cleaning recovery of the municipal waste...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{demonstrates}} that the resistance movement of forest communities in western Midnapore division in West Bengal, which acted as a key precursor to the joint forest management (JFM) programmes in India through a June 1990 Ministry of Environment and Forests circular, was based {{to a large extent}} on the successful experience of JFM in Arabari Hills under this division. In this particular locality, the resistance movement of forest communities had been mobilized for a long time by poor forest communities fighting for their community rights to forest resources as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> immediate <b>survival,</b> opposing top-down approaches to forest management. A detailed study of the existing four Forest Protection Committees (FPCs) of this area confirms that these immediate survival needs, generating mainly sustenance and income from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for FPC members, are the key element for the long-term sustainability of a JFM system...|$|R
50|$|On {{their way}} back to the hatch, Jack and Kate see {{what seems to be a}} small cloud of smoke move through some nearby trees, and they hear the {{rumbling}} of The Monster, which ensnares Locke's leg and drags him through the jungle. Jack grabs onto Locke to prevent him from being pulled into a hole, though Locke pleads with Jack to let him go. Jack then instructs Kate to drop a stick of dynamite into the tunnel, which causes an underground explosion, resulting in black smoke coming out of a nearby hole on the horizon, and disappearing. The hold on Locke slackens and they are able to extract him. Jack and Locke discuss the situation, and Locke says that Jack is a man of science, but that he is a man of faith. Locke believes everything that has occurred, including the death of Boone, was predestined, leading them all to the opening of the hatch. Jack disagrees, and believes that opening the hatch is <b>a</b> simple <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands, flood {{protection}} is <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> national <b>survival.</b> In 2008, the Second Delta Committee recommended increasing legal {{flood protection}} standards at least tenfold {{to compensate for}} population and economic growth since 1953; this recommendation would have required dike improvement investments estimated at 11. 5 billion euro. Our research group was charged with developing efficient flood protection standards in a more objective way. We used cost-benefit analysis and mixed-integer nonlinear programming to demonstrate the efficiency of increasing the legal standards in three critical regions only. Monte Carlo analysis confirms the robustness of this recommendation. In 2012, the state secretary of the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment accepted our results {{as a basis for}} legislation. Compared to the earlier recommendation, this successful application of operations research yields both a highly significant increase in protection for these regions (in which two-thirds of the benefits of the proposed improvements accrue) and approximately 7. 8 billion euro in cost savings. Our methods can also be used in decision making for other flood-prone areas worldwide...|$|R
40|$|To my family… In most {{business}} areas today, competition is hard {{and it is}} <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> company <b>survival</b> to interpret and follow up changes within the business market. The margin between success and failure is small. Possessing suitable, sustainable information systems is an advantage when attempting {{to stay in the}} front line of the business area.

Keeping business systems up-to-date in a business environment such as this one, the telecom business, that changes rapidly and continuously, is a huge challenge. One way to approach this challenge is through flexibility in systems. The power of flexibility is that it keeps the system usable and relevant and allows it to evolve.
