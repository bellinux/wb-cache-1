Brazilians, when concerned with pronunciation, look up to what is considered the national standard variety, and never the European one, specially <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of tension between Portugal and the settlers (immigrants) in Brazil since the country's de-facto settlement, as immigrants were forbidden of speaking freely on their native languages in Brazil by fear of severe punishment by the Portuguese law enforcers. Lately, Brazilians in general have had some exposure to European speech, through TV and music. Often one will see Brazilian actors working in Portugal, and Portuguese actors working in Brazil, despite the differences on spoken language.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{community}} opposition, the SIRT discontinued passenger {{service on the}} North Shore Branch and the South Beach Branch at midnight on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. By 1955, the third rail on both of the lines were removed. On September 7, 1954, the SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger service on the Tottenville sub-division on October 7, 1954. The PSC warned that if the SIRT discontinued its passenger service, action would be taken to kick the SIRT's parent company, the B Railroad, off of Staten Island, which would have meant {{the end of its}} prospering freight operation. A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville sub-division to continue. Since the Tottenville sub-division did not need the additional trains cars left over from the closure of the North Shore and South Beach lines, the SIRT sold 30 of its train cars to the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) in the years 1953–1954, for $10,000 each.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that {{there is no reason why}} the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these can be thought of as open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (<b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E

25|$|Pitrājñāpālanam (Sanskrit: पित्राज्ञापालनम्). Jamadagni {{requests}} Paraśurāma {{to marry}} and enter {{the second stage of}} life, the Gārhasthya Āśrama ("householder's life"). Paraśurāma respectfully turns the request down, saying he wishes to be forever away from the bondage of family. One morning, Reṇukā goes to a lake to fetch water. There she sees the Gandharva king Citraratha, taking delight in the water of the lake with his wife. Reṇukā is attracted to Citraratha and returns home excited, fantasizing about him. Jamadagni senses this and orders his three elder sons to kill their mother who he says has become impure by her adulterous thoughts. When the brothers refuse to carry out his command, Jamadagni asks Paraśurāma to do the same. Paraśurāma is caught between the command of his father, and the indebtedness to mother – he remembers the Smṛti scriptures which says the mother is ten times the greater than the father. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of thought and counter-thought, he decides to obey his father. Paraśurāma beheads his mother and three brothers. Jamadagni is pleased and offers Paraśurāma two wishes. Paraśurāma asks for the resurrection of all four as the first wish, and their loss of memory about their killing as the second one. Jamadagni grants both the wishes and Reṇukā and her three sons get up as if from sleep. Paraśurāma thus satisfies his father and also brings back his mother to life.|$|E

After getting in touch with Walden, Griffith frantically implored him to produce the song, describing how important the song would be for Houston's future album. After hearing the song's demo, Walden agreed to fly down to San Rafael, California to arrange it.

500|$|While {{preparing}} for the studio sessions, the band focused on their vocal interplay by practicing barbershop quartet-style songs, which helped both Cuomo and Sharp feel more comfortable collaborating during rehearsals. Sharp, who had never sung before joining Weezer, developed his falsetto backing vocal: [...] "I had to sing an octave higher than Rivers. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of practice, I started to get it down."

However, Pattammal's recording was excluded from the final cut in favour of a version recorded by Rathinam. Vasan later told Randor Guy that the character of Malini was an impoverished woman with no training in music when the song takes place, {{and could not be}} expected to sing with the [...] "class, perfection and brilliance" [...] of Pattammal.
