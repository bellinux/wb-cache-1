5|$|Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky {{areas on}} coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also {{sometimes}} use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau's tern and some Forster's terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy {{and the white}} tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern,</b> may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land {{for up to five}} years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} terns, the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern</b> feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. The {{offering}} of fish by the male {{to the female}} {{is part of the}} courtship display.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern</b> (Onychoprion aleuticus, {{formerly}} Sterna aleutica) is a seabird in {{the family}} Laridae. The genus name is from Ancient Greek onux, [...] "claw", and [...] "prion", nail. The specific aleuticus refers to the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
50|$|Foxes were {{introduced}} to Nizki Island by Russian fur traders in the 19th century. This decimated the population of many bird species on the island. The last fox was removed from Nizki Island in 1976, and now Aleutian Canada Geese (once believed to be extinct), Puffins, and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Terns</b> are common on the island.|$|R
50|$|This {{species may}} eat birds and their eggs, {{including}} almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species. Although not typically {{able to capture}} a healthy grown bird, eggs, nestlings and fledglings of large bird species can be very attractive to brown bears. Species attacked have ranged can be any size available from <b>Aleutian</b> <b>terns</b> (Onychoprion aleuticus) to trumpeter and whooper swans (Cygnus buccinator & cygnus). Most recorded avian prey have consisted of geese and sea ducks nesting in the lower Arctic Circle, followed by coveys of galliforms, as these birds place their nests in shallow water {{and on the ground}} as well as raise their chicks in such areas, so are relatively more vulnerable. Large birds of prey including sea eagles, gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) and golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) are sometimes exploited as prey if nesting in rock formations accessible on foot and eagles and falcons may furiously dive at bears near their nests. Due to their inhabitance of cooler temperate areas, reptiles and amphibians are rarely a food source and have been verified as prey only in a few cases: frogs in the Italian Alps, rat snakes in Hokkaido, grass lizards in the Amur territory and tortoises in Greece.|$|R
40|$|The North Gulf Coast - Prince William Sound {{region of}} Alaska, phytographically, {{lies at the}} {{northern}} limit of the Sitka Spruce-hemlock coastal/subalpine forests of the Pacific Coast; it includes approximately 178, 500 km 2 and a shoreline of approximately 8, 500 km. Fourteen habitats are utilized by birds: tundra; shrub thickets; hemlock-Sitka Spruce forests; bogs; mixed deciduous-spruce woodlands; marshes; lacustrine waters; fluviatile waters; cliffs, bluffs, and screes; moraines, alluvia, and barrier islands; beaches and tidal flats; rocky shores and reefs; inshore waters; and offshore waters. Two hundred nineteen species of birds have been recorded in the region, 111 of which are primarily water-related. Status, abundance, habitat, and seasonal occurrence {{are discussed in the}} annotated list of species. The geographic location and restrictive topography of the region make it a spectacular corridor for millions of migrating birds. In spring millions of Pintails, Dunlins, Western Sandpipers, and Northern Phalaropes move through the region, as do tens of thousands of Whistling Swans, Snow Geese, Knots, and Sanderlings. Fall concentrations of White-fronted Geese and Sandhill Cranes may exceed 100, 000 's. Species with notably large summering populations include Trumpeter Swans (several hundred breeding pairs), Bald Eagles (1, 800 - 2, 000 breeding pairs), <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Terns</b> (150 - 250 breeding pairs on Copper River Delta), Marbled Murrelets (probably millions), and Kittlitz's Murrelets (probably a few 100, 000 's). Significant range extensions reported include Yellow-billed Loons (fairly common in winter), Pink-footed and Pale-footed shearwaters, Brandt's Cormorants (breeding), Red-faced Cormorants (breeding), Steller's Eiders (winter), Bristle-thighed Curlews (migrant), Bar-tailed Godwits (migrant), Crested Auklets (winter), and northernmost wintering populations of waterfowl (Canada Geese, Gadwalls, Pintails, Green-winged Teals, American Widgeons) and shorebirds (Surfbirds, Black Trunstones, Dunlins, and Sanderlings). Some unexpected species reported include Skua, Anna's Hummingbird, Purple Marin, Yellowthroat, Common Grackle, and White-throated Sparrow...|$|R
50|$|There are spruce forests on {{the island}} and smelts (Hypomesus japonicus) and (H. olidus) are found in Lake Bol'shoe. In the spring and summer Steller's sea eagle and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern</b> nest {{on the island}}; long-billed murrelet also appear to breed here.|$|E
50|$|On 28-29 May 1979, an <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern,</b> a rare tern {{from the}} Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, visited the Farnes. It was the first, {{and still the}} only, member of its species ever seen {{anywhere}} in Europe. It remains a complete mystery how it arrived here.|$|E
50|$|Three of {{the four}} species are tropical, and one has a sub-polar {{breeding}} range. The sooty tern has a pan-tropical distribution; the bridled tern also breeds across the Tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean but in the central Pacific it is replaced by the spectacled tern. The <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern</b> breeds around Alaska and Siberia but winters in the tropics around South East Asia.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{endangered}} birds on these islands, including the Blakiston's fish owl, osprey, black stork, red-necked grebe, gyrfalcon, solitary snipe, Steller's sea eagle and the Siberian grouse. In {{the spring and}} summer, a number of seabird species nest on the islands, including black-headed and slaty-backed gull, common and thick-billed murre, horned and tufted puffin, spectacled guillemot, <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern,</b> long-billed murrelet, and pelagic cormorant.|$|E
50|$|A close {{relative}} of the bridled and sooty terns (with which it is sometimes confused), the spectacled tern is less common than {{the other members of}} its genus and it has been studied less. The three species, along with the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern</b> were recently split into a new genus Onychoprion from Sterna (Bridge et al., 2005). They resemble the sooty tern but with a grey back instead of a black one. Their breast and underparts are white, and they have a black eye line from the bill {{to the back of the}} head.|$|E
50|$|Over {{a million}} seabirds gather to nest on {{numerous}} large colonies along {{almost all the}} coastal cliffs. The most common are northern fulmar; common, brunnich's and pigeon guillemots; horned and tufted puffins; cormorants; gulls; and kittiwakes including the extremely local red-legged kittiwake which nests {{in only a few}} other colonies in the world. Waterfowl and sandpipers are also abundant along the pre-lake depressions and river valleys of Bering Island, though largely absent from Medny Island. Migratory birds of note with critical nesting or feeding habitat on the islands include such species as Steller's eider, Pacific golden plover, and <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern.</b> Raptors of note include the rare Steller's sea eagle and gyrfalcon. In total, over 180 bird species have been registered on the Commander Islands.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The plant {{communities}} of the reserve are highly dependent on proximity to the sea, and altitude zonation. The richest floral families are the grasses and members of Asteraceae, plus species of the Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae, Cabbage, and Heath families. Otherwise, the area is relatively species-poor due to isolation since the pre-glacial time. Scientists on the reserve have recorded 312 species of vascular plants. The forested areas feature stunted trees, with willow, alder and poplar common on the floodplains. The slopes of the Koryak Highlands on the Gauvin peninsula support cedar forests. [...] Scientists on the reserve have recorded 44 species of mammals: 24 permanent residents, 5 migrants, and 15 marine mammals. The rivers the reserve are important spawning grounds for salmon, chum, brown trout, brook trout, and the Kamchatka grayling. Because of its large, marshy character, the Parapolsky site {{is home to a}} wide variety of water and wading birds - ducks, geese, cormorants, and gulls. During the spring and autumn migration, hundreds of thousands of birds nest or rest on the site. The Koryak Highlands are one of the largest sites for bighorn sheep in northeast Asia. The Cape Gauvin and Lavosky sites, with coastal rocks and ledges, are home to over 30 large colonies of seabirds. [...] Species include the Steller's sea eagle, <b>Aleutian</b> <b>tern,</b> and the Spoon-billed sandpiper.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Tern</b> (Onychoprion) aleutica breeds only in Alaska {{and eastern}} Siberia. It nests in coastal colonies that are {{distributed}} {{over a wide}} range. In Alaska, it frequently associates with Arctic Terns (Sterna paradisaea) on the breeding grounds. The two species are very similar in appearance and {{may be difficult to}} differentiate. Both have a black cap, but the Aleutian has a white forehead. During the breeding season, the Arctic Tern has a bright red bill, feet and legs while the Aleutian's are black. Until recently, the <b>Aleutian</b> <b>Tern</b> was placed in the large genus Sterna which included most terns. In 2006, the American Ornithologists ’ Union reclassified this species based on genetic sequence comparisons. It is now in the genus Onychoprion which includes three othe...|$|E
