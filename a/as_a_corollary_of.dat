This latter assessment was based early on around her recurrent lying, and the fact she seems to excuse her own cheating in the first few seasons <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>corollary</b> <b>of</b> empowerment and as research for her book: which features an experimentalist female character who is evidently herself. Kirshner has described Jenny as mostly being duplicitous and confused. Jenny often acted [...] "utterly impulsive".

The self-reference effect describes the greater recall capacity for a particular stimulus if it is related semantically to the subject. This can be thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>corollary</b> <b>of</b> the familiarity modifier, because stimuli specifically related to an event in a person's life will have widespread activation in that person's semantic network.

2500|$|Since {{the field}} of {{constructible}} points is closed under square roots, it contains all points that {{can be obtained by}} a finite sequence of quadratic extensions of {{the field of}} complex numbers with rational coefficients. By the above paragraph, one can show that any constructible point can be obtained by such a sequence of extensions. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>corollary</b> <b>of</b> this, one finds that the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible point (and therefore of any constructible length) is a power of2. In particular, any constructible point (or length) is an algebraic number, though not every algebraic number is constructible; for example, [...] is algebraic but not constructible.|$|E

60|$|Again, {{the laws}} of the effect of {{pressure}} and heat on gaseous bodies, the fact that they combine in definite proportions by volume, and that such proportion bears a simple relation to their combining weights, all harmonised with the Daltonian hypothesis, and led to the bold speculation known as the law of Avogadro--that all gaseous bodies, under the same physical conditions, contain the same number of units. In the form in which it was first enunciated, this hypothesis was incorrect--perhaps it is not exactly true in any form; but it is hardly too much to say that chemistry and molecular physics would never have advanced to their present condition unless it had been assumed to be true. Another immense service rendered by Dalton, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>corollary</b> <b>of</b> the new atomic doctrine, was the creation of a system of symbolic notation, which not only made the nature of chemical compounds and processes easily intelligible and easy of recollection, but, by its very form, suggested new lines of inquiry.
