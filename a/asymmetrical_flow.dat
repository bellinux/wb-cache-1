The main flow patterns {{that can be}} encountered in rectangular shallow reservoirs are described: symmetrical flows without any reattachment point (S 0), <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flows</b> with one reattachment point (A 1), and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flows</b> with two reattachment points (A 2). The influence of geometrical and hydraulic parameters on reattachment lengths is intensively investigated.

The theory for AF4 was conceived in 1986 and was established in 1987. It is a separation technique based on the theory of field flow fractionation (FFF). AF4 is distinct from FFF because it contains only one permeable wall so the cross-flow is caused only by the carrier liquid.

The applied bias current decomposes the solution by electrolysis into tiny gas bubbles that cling to the metal point insulating the metal tip from the solution thus reducing the bias current. An incoming R.F. current can flow better in the direction across the point that makes the point more negative. That recombines the gases and increases point exposure to the liquid.

40|$|A general {{method of}} solving Oseen's linearized {{equations}} for two-dimensional {{steady flow of}} a viscous incompressible fluid past a cylinder in an unbounded field is developed. The analysis is developed {{in terms of the}} scalar vorticity and stream function and it is shown that the vorticity for Oseen flow problems can be obtained separately from the stream function. The determination of the vorticity can be effected using conditions of an integral character deduced from the no-slip condition at the cylinder surface together with the conditions at large distances. The independent determination of the vorticity seems to be a new step in Oseen theory. The method enables one to obtain many properties of the flow in terms of the Reynolds number by using only the vorticity without the necessity of finding the stream function. The use of integral conditions makes the detailed calcula-tions straightforward, systematic, and elementary. The method is tested by applying it to the case of uniform flow past an elliptic cylinder at an arbitrary angle of incidence and also to cases of symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flows</b> past circular cylinders. The leading approximation for small Reynolds number is obtained where possible.

40|$|Flow fields {{around an}} {{oscillating}} circular cylinder are studied by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variable formulation. A finite volume method with a pressure predictor-corrector scheme is {{used and the}} solution procedure is accelerated by a local time stepping technique. Numerical tests are carried out at the Keulegan-Carpenter number KC < 20 and Reynolds number Re < 4000. For the symmetrical flow (at either very low KC or low Re), the vorticity decaying effect is dominant in the flow field. At higher Re, the vorticity convection becomes stronger, eventually leading to {{the inception of the}} <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flow</b> pattern. It was found that within this critical regime the artificial disturbances imposed to the Row field {{play an important role in}} determining the flow patterns: if the flow falls into the symmetrical category, it remains symmetrical even with the artificial disturbances; while if the flow falls into the unsymmetrical category, the artificial disturbances are necessary for the correct predictions. An inception boundary of the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flow</b> in the KC-Re plane can thus be defined through a systematic study of the response of the flow field to the small disturbances. For the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flow</b> (at higher KC and/or Re), several distinguished flow patterns are identified in the numerical simulations, including quasi-symmetrical flow, diagonal vortex pair shedding, transverse street and double vortex pairs shedding. Agreement between the present results and the Row visualization (particle tracing) is generally good. The forces acting on the cylinder are also predicted for both the symmetrical and the asymmetrical Rows. The conventional drag and inertia coefficients are deduced and compared with other numerical and experimental results, also showing good agreement. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{is characterized}} by anterior ossification of the spine {{and can lead to}} dysphagia and airway obstruction. The morphology of the newly formed bone in the cervical spine is different compared to the thoracic spine, possibly due to dissimilarities in local vascular anatomy. In this study the spatial relationship of the new bone with the arterial system, trachea and esophagus was analyzed and compared between subjects with and without DISH. METHODS: Cervical computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained from five patients with dysphagia and DISH and ten control subjects. The location of the vertebral and carotid arteries, surface area of the hyperostosis and distance between the vertebral body and the trachea and esophagus was assessed in the axial view. RESULTS: The surface area of the newly formed bone was located symmetrically anterior to the vertebral body. The ossifications were non-flowing in the sagittal view and no segmental vessels were observed. Substantial displacement of the trachea/esophagus was present in the group with DISH compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperostosis at the cervical level was symmetrically distributed anterior to the vertebral bodies without a flowing pattern, in contrast to the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>flowing</b> pattern typically found in the thoracic spine. The hypothesis that the vascular system acts as a natural barrier against new bone formation in DISH could be further supported with these findings.

We examined the potential for <b>asymmetrical</b> gene <b>flow</b> in sympatric populations of Eucalyptus aggregata and Eucalyptus rubida, both long-lived trees of southern Australia. A total of 421 adults from three hybrid zones were genotyped with six microsatellite markers. We used genealogical assignments, admixture analysis and analyses of spatial genetic structure and spatial distribution of individuals, to assess {{patterns of}} interspecific gene flow within populations. A high number of admixed individuals were detected (13. 9 – 40 % of individuals), with hybrid populations consisting of F 1 and F 2 hybrids and backcrosses in both parental directions. Across the three sites, admixture proportions were skewed towards the E. aggregata genetic cluster (x= 0. 56 – 0. 65), indicating that backcrossing towards E. aggregata is more frequent. Estimates of long-term migration rates also indicate asymmetric gene flow, with higher migration rates from E. aggregata to hybrids compared with E. rubida. Taken together, these results indicate a greater genetic input from E. aggregata into the hybrid populations. This asymmetry probably reflects differences in style lengths (E. rubida: ∼ 7 [*]mm, E. aggregata: ∼ 4 [*]mm), which can prevent pollen tubes of smaller-flowered species from fertilizing larger-flowered species. However, analyses of fine-scale genetic structure suggest that localized seed dispersal (< 40 [*]m) and greater clustering between hybrid and E. aggregata individuals may also contribute to directional gene flow.
