Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} of peak load reduction strategies in residential buildings {{contributes to the}} global international efforts in reducing energy consumption and is related directly to energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings. Work reported here involves computer aided building energy simulation of energy <b>efficient</b> <b>and</b> non-energy <b>efficient</b> residential homes coupled with empirical energy consumption data gathered from monitoring an array of energy efficient residential homes. The latter have been implemented for peak load reduction strategies. In addition non-energy efficient residential homes have been monitored to compare performance to the energy efficient homes. This study demonstrates the crucial importance of energy efficiency and peak load reduction strategies in sustaining the energy needs of the southwest US region using Las Vegas for the actual setting. It provides the largest energy consumption data set examined, specifically peak consumption, from energy <b>efficient</b> <b>and</b> non-energy <b>efficient</b> homes at this location. The study demonstrates the peak load reduction benefits {{of a variety of}} strategies, namely roof-integrated PV panels, energy <b>efficient</b> building envelope, <b>and</b> substation battery storage. The study focuses on the month of August 2011 and shows how the load reduction can reach 75 % at peak times during that month using the computer aided energy simulation. Moreover, the study compares the recorded electrical consumption data from the collection of energy <b>efficient</b> <b>and</b> non-energy <b>efficient</b> residential homes <b>and</b> proves the simulation results in reaching the 75 % reduction in electrical consumption at peak times. The study also tries to marry the gathered electrical consumption data of the energy <b>efficient</b> <b>and</b> non-energy <b>efficient</b> homes with the computer simulation model. This is done to reach an actual representative model which behaves similarly to the average of the group of energy <b>and</b> non-energy <b>efficient</b> homes. The benefit of the energy efficient strategies in reducing the load in peak times is emphasized...|$|R
