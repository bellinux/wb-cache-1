In a letter written in 1203, the Bulgarian tsar Kaloyan informed Pope Innocent that Emeric had occupied five districts in Bulgaria, and Kaloyan demanded the Pope's intervention.|$|E

5|$|As one of {{the senior}} monks of Gautama Buddha, some of Koṇḍañña's {{writings}} and discourses to other monks are recorded in the literature. A poem consisting of sixteen verses in the Theragatha is attributed to him. The first of these {{is said to have}} been recited by Sacca in praise of Koṇḍañña, after Koṇḍañña had preached the Four Noble Truths to Sacca. In other verses, Koṇḍañña is shown admonishing monks who had fallen into ways contrary to Buddhist teaching. Koṇḍañña <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> his own struggles against Mara, the demon who attempted to prevent the enlightenment of the Buddha. Koṇḍañña was also praised in the Udana by the Buddha, who observed his deliverance from the destructiveness of craving.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became evident that the two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that acknowledged the existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged,</b> but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E

After some time, Shahrbaraz had Shamta, {{the son of the}} former {{financial}} minister Yazdin, crucified on a church in Margha. The reason of this execution was reportedly because the latter had insulted Shahrbaraz during the reign of Khosrow II. Forty days later, 9 June 630, during a ceremony, Shahrbaraz was killed by a spear thrown by Farrukh Hormizd, who then helped Borandukht, the daughter of Khosrow II, to ascend the throne.|$|E
5|$|Roupen III of Armenian Cilicia laid siege to Lampron, {{the seat}} of his rival, Hethum III of Lampron. Hethum sent envoys to Bohemond, seeking his assistance. Bohemond invited Roupen to a banquet to Antioch where he had Roupen {{captured}} and imprisoned in 1185. Bohemond invaded Cilicia, but he could not prevent Roupen's brother, Leo, from seizing Lampron. An Armenian nobleman, Pagouran of Barbaron, medieted a peace treaty. Roupen agreed to pay a ransom and to renounce Sarventikar, Tall Hamdun, Mamistra, and Adana. He <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Bohemond's suzerainty. After the ransom was paid in 1186, Bohemond released Roupen, who soon reconquered the fortresses and towns that he had ceded to Antioch.|$|E

She <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> having helped Bamber, in March or April 1985, steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned; she said he had staged a break-in to make it appear that strangers were responsible.|$|E

5|$|Charles VII {{spent most}} of his three-year reign as emperor {{residing}} in Frankfurt while Maria Theresa battled Prussia for her patrimony in Bohemia and Hungary. Frederick could not secure Bohemia for Charles, but he did manage to push the Austrians out of Bavaria. For the last three months of his short reign, the gout-ridden Charles lived in Munich, where he died in January 1745. His son, Maximilian III Joseph (known as Max Joseph) inherited his father's electoral dignities but not his imperial ambition. With the Peace of Füssen (22 April 1745), Max Joseph promised to vote for Francis of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's husband, in the pending imperial election. He <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the Pragmatic Sanction. In return, he obtained the restitution of his family's electoral position and territories. For his subjects, his negotiations ended five years of warfare and brought a generation of peace and relative prosperity that began with his father's death in 1745 and ended with his own in 1777.|$|E
5|$|John paid {{homage to}} Suleiman at Mohács in 1529 to secure Ottoman support against Ferdinand. However, neither John nor Ferdinand could win {{control of the}} whole country during the next years. To {{conclude}} the civil war, the two kings' envoys signed the Treaty of Várad on 24February 1538, which confirmed both kings' right to retain the lands that they held. John, who was childless, <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Ferdinand's right {{to take control of}} his realm (the central and eastern part of the Kingdom of Hungary) after his death. John also stipulated, if he fathered a son, his son would inherit his ancestral domains. Ferdinand, however, proved unable to protect John's realm against an Ottoman invasion. At age 52 John married Isabella Jagiellon, the 22-year-old daughter of Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, on 2March 1539. The humanist scholars Paolo Giovio and Antun Vrančić emphasized that Isabella {{was one of the most}} educated women of their age.|$|E
5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement under surveillance, the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E

5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton {{found it hard to}} talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role in}} the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he <b>also</b> <b>acknowledged</b> the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E
