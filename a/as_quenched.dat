Maggie was full {{of the sense of}} THAT--so full that it made her impatient; whereupon she moved forward a little, placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere, but that she had suddenly called to recognition. Charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed, and instinctively, with her pale stare, she stiffened herself for protest. Maggie could make that out--as well as, further, however, that her second impression of her friend's approach had an instant effect on her attitude. The Princess came nearer, gravely and in silence, but fairly paused again, to give her time for whatever she would. Whatever she would, whatever she could, was what Maggie wanted--wanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted. That was not what Charlotte had wanted the other night, but this never mattered--the great thing was to allow her, was fairly to produce in her, the sense of highly choosing. At first, clearly, she had been frightened; she had not been pursued, it had quickly struck her, without some design on the part of her pursuer, and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had, when herself the pursuer, made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose? It had sunk into Maggie at the time, that hard insistence, and Mrs. Verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink; which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally, till now, remained with her. But her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure, so dishonestly come by, for which her companion's still countenance, at the hour and afterwards, had consented to serve as the deep soil, might have worked up again to the surface, to be thrown back upon her hands. Yes, it was positive that during one of these minutes the Princess had the vision of her particular alarm. [...] "It's her lie, it's her lie that has mortally disagreed with her; she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it, and she has come to retract it, to disown it and denounce it--to give me full in my face the truth instead." [...] This, for a concentrated instant, Maggie felt her helplessly gasp--but only to let it bring home the indignity, the pity of her state. She herself could but tentatively hover, place in view the book she carried, look as little dangerous, look as abjectly mild, as possible; remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west, people who threw up their hands, on certain occasions, as a sign they weren't carrying revolvers. She could almost have smiled at last, troubled as she yet knew herself, to show how richly she was harmless; she held up her volume, which was so weak a weapon, and while she continued, for consideration, to keep her distance, she explained with <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> a quaver as possible. [...] "I saw you come out--saw you from my window, and couldn't bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book.

50|$|Steel {{that has}} been arc welded, gas welded, or welded in any other manner besides forge welded, is {{affected}} in a localized area by {{the heat from the}} welding process. This localized area, called the heat-affected zone (HAZ), consists of steel that varies considerably in hardness, from normalized steel to steel nearly as hard <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> steel near the edge of this heat-affected zone. Thermal contraction from the uneven heating, solidification and cooling creates internal stresses in the metal, both within and surrounding the weld. Tempering is sometimes used in place of stress relieving (even heating and cooling of the entire object to just below the A1 temperature) to both reduce the internal stresses and to decrease the brittleness around the weld. Localized tempering is often used on welds when the construction is too large, intricate, or otherwise too inconvenient to heat the entire object evenly. Tempering temperatures for this purpose are generally around 205 C and 343 C.|$|E

5000|$|V. Kumaran {{wrote the}} {{following}} comment regarding Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics: ... In this, he introduced the now standard concept of ‘ensemble’, {{which is a}} collection {{of a large number of}} indistinguishable replicas of the system under consideration, which interact with each other, but which are isolated from the rest of the universe. The replicas could be in different microscopic states, as determined by the positions and momenta of the constituent molecules, for example, but the macroscopic state determined by the pressure, temperature and/or other thermodynamic variables are identical. Gibbs argued that the of the properties of the system, averaged over time, is identical to an average over all the members of the ensemble if the ‘ergodic hypothesis’ is valid. The ergodic hypothesis, which states that all the microstates of the system are sampled with equal probability, is applicable to most systems, with the exception of systems such <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> glasses which are in metastable states. Thus, the ensemble averaging method provides us an easy way to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, without having to observe it for long periods of time. Gibbs also used this tool to obtain relationships between systems constrained in different ways, for example, to relate the properties of a system at constant volume and energy with those at constant temperature and pressure. Even today, the concept of ensemble is widely used for sampling in computer simulations of the thermodynamic properties of materials, and has subsequently found uses in other fields such as quantum theory.|$|E

In the " <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> " and the " 650 °C annealed " state no martensitic transformations (MT's) occur. The diffraction pattems show faint reflections originating from coherent Ni.

Additional reflections of the type 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 result from various lattice displacement waves, which are precursors of the MT's to the B 1 9 'and R-phase, respectively. Indeed, high resolution TEM micrographs of the [001] zone of the " <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> " sample reveal transverse 1 / 2 lattice displacement waves, precursors of the B 19 'martensite. The coherent Ni 4 Ti, precipitates, homogeneously distributed on a small length scale, hinder the MT's in the " <b>as</b> <b>quenched</b> " and the " 650 °C annealed " state, and thus only the precursors appear. When annealed at T= 3 80 °C, however, coherent Ni. Ti, precipitates with a length of lOnm are clearly visible in TEM.
