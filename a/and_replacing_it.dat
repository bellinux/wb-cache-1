5|$|The £500million {{restoration}} plan announced by Network Rail in 2005 {{was approved by}} Camden London Borough Council in 2007. It involved restoring and reglazing the original arched train shed roof and removing the 1972 extension {{at the front of}} the station <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with an open-air plaza.|$|E
5|$|According to Dawlatshah, Abdollah-ibn-Tahir, an Arabicized Persian, and {{governor}} of Khorasan for the Abbasid caliphs, banned publication in Persian {{and by his}} order all the Zoroastrians were forced to bring their religious books to be thrown in the fire. As a result, many literary works written in Pahlavi script disappeared. During the Abbasid reign the Zoroastrians, {{for the first time}} became a minority in Iran. Nevertheless, there were instances of toleration during the Abbasid era, particularly under the reign of Al-Mu'tasim who flogged an imam and muezzin for destroying a fire-temple <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a mosque.|$|E
5|$|After Desha was elected, Relief legislators, {{who held}} {{majorities}} {{in both houses}} of the General Assembly, attempted to remove the offending judges from office. Failing to achieve the needed two-thirds majority, the legislature passed a reorganization act abolishing the Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a new court. Desha appointed justices favoring relief. The original court continued to claim authority as the court of last resort in the state; during {{what became known as the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, both courts operated simultaneously, with both claiming legitimacy. It was a politically tumultuous time.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, in a {{security}} operation known as Operation Spectrum, 22 Roman Catholic church and social activists and professionals were detained under the ISA. They {{were accused of}} being members of a dangerous Marxist conspiracy bent on subverting the government by force <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a Marxist state. The detentions led to, among others, the Chng Suan Tze and Teo Soh Lung cases.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes between the three main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with other tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal pointing out the better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E
5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant {{that much of the}} chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice, {{once the}} new Cunard board had been constituted, turned his {{attention}} to the new cruise ship being built for the company. The ship, codenamed Q4, had been proposed and planned under the auspices of his predecessor, John Brocklebank. However, with the ship now approaching completion and requiring fitting out, it would fall to Smallpeice and his board to appoint interior and exterior designers and approve design schemes for the new ship. Smallpeice, having assessed a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit, decided on significant alterations to the interior layout, abolishing the old three class layout <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a flexible layout which could be split into two classes for North Atlantic crossings and combined into a single class layout for cruising in the Caribbean. This new layout was expected to suit the tastes of American passengers, predicted to be the largest passenger group on the new liner.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the financial Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians in debt and unable to meet their financial obligations. A debt relief movement began in the state, and pro-relief candidates won majorities in the General Assembly in 1820. The Assembly passed a law of replevin that was extremely favorable to debtors. Disgruntled creditors challenged {{the constitutionality of the}} law, appealing their case to the Court of Appeals. The court opined in favor of the creditors. Attempts to remove the anti-relief justices failed. The pro-relief legislature passed a measure abolishing the Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a new court, to which pro-relief governor Joseph Desha appointed pro-relief justices who upheld the replevin law.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{modifications}} were made between 1870 and 1875, {{when some of}} the parapets with embrasures were demolished to make way for emplacements for RML 9 inch 12 ton guns. The remainder of the fort underwent further significant changes over the following years. In the 1880s, the British considered demolishing the fort <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with a larger fortification, but in 1888 it was proposed that instead of demolition, the height of the ramparts should be reduced {{to the level of the}} glacis. In the 1890s, gun emplacements for breech-loading (BL) guns were built on the glacis, while further modifications were made when parts of the structure were converted to gun crew accommodation or magazines.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{through the}} downtowns of Benton Harbor and St. Joseph {{was a part}} of US12 when the United States Numbered Highway System was created in late 1926. US31 was also routed {{concurrently}} through the area. The US33 designation was later added to US31 from the state line northward to US12 in St. Joseph in 1937. On November 2, 1960, the I-94/US12 freeway opened around the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area, and the former route of US12 through downtown was renumbered BL I-94. By the next year, US33 was extended along BL I-94/US31, and the eastern end of BL I-94 was converted to a divided highway. In 1962, US31 was rerouted out of downtown Benton Harbor and St. Joseph to follow a new freeway east of Benton Harbor, removing it from BL I-94/US33. US33 was truncated in 1986, removing it from BL I-94 <b>and</b> <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with M-63 the following year when signage was updated. The Great Lakes Circle Tours were approved by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) and its counterparts in Minnesota, Ontario and Wisconsin. In 2016, the section of the business loop concurrent with M-63 was dedicated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E
