5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet.</b> During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went {{to use the}} toilet during the ninth inning. While he was off the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no right fielder. The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E

5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E
5|$|Soon after that, {{he entered}} a feud with World Heavyweight Champion Kane. He {{defeated}} Mysterio and Alberto Del Rio to become the number one contender for Kane's World Championship at WWE's Survivor Series PPV event, which ended in a draw. The following week, Edge lost his match with David Otunga thanks to Paul Bearer's interference. He kidnapped Bearer after this and used him to cost Kane his match with Big Show On November 19, Edge tortured Paul Bearer forcing him to play dodge ball and force feeding him, planning to wear down Kane. He then ambushed Kane in the garage when he was <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from Paul Bearer and drove away with his hostage.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis of the circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E
5|$|US-60 next {{comes to}} a {{junction}} with SH-123 as it enters Bartlesville. The SH-123 junction lies <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> into Washington County; south of the junction, US-60 and SH-123 form a concurrency, and the two routes curve slightly {{to the west and}} straddle the Washington–Osage county line. After only , US-60 turns to the east along Adams Boulevard, splitting away from SH-123, and fully enters Washington County. US-60 runs through downtown Bartlesville on Adams, then bridges the Caney River. The highway continues to an interchange with US-75. At this interchange, US-60 turns south and overlaps US-75 before splitting off to the east once again, leaving Bartlesville and, soon, Washington County behind.|$|E

At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself.

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet.</b> The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2006, American comedian Stephen Colbert {{appeared}} as the featured entertainer at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, {{which was held}} in Washington, D.C., at the Hilton Washington hotel. Colbert's performance, consisting of a 16-minute podium speech and a 7-minute video presentation, was broadcast live across the United States on the cable television networks C-SPAN and MSNBC. Standing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from U.S. President George W. Bush, {{in front of an}} audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps, Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media. He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.|$|E

NY89 turns north onto Taughannock Boulevard at the next intersection while NY96 continues west across the lake outlet as Cliff Street, paralleling NY79. They do not intersect in this area—known locally as The Octopus—though they once did. At one time, NY96, NY79, NY89, NY13A and Elm Street met at an intersection that gave the area its name. Today, only NY13A and NY79 intersect there while the stub of former NY89 is now a park access road that intersects with NY96, which continues north out of the Cayuga Lake valley as Trumansburg Road.|$|E

50|$|Cross Run begins {{immediately}} east of Pismire Ridge in Hazle Township. The stream flows west-southwest {{for several}} hundred feet. It then turns south and after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> enters <b>a</b> reservoir. At the southwestern corner of the reservoir, the stream passes through the Upper Mount Pleasant Dam and almost immediately turns southeast, entering a second reservoir after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet.</b> At the southeastern corner of this reservoir, it flows south-southwest {{for several hundred}} feet before receiving an unnamed tributary and turning west. After several hundred feet, the stream enters a third lake and turns south-southwest.

5|$|Overall {{damage was}} {{generally}} minor. There were {{no reports of}} wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24inches (600mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20inches (508mm). The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes. Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico. No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> took place {{to the north of}} the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle.|$|E
5|$|The Corinthians {{gained a}} corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was {{followed}} up by a further {{attack by the}} amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E

5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} {{began with a}} speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, {{resulting}} in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to be about to score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of Taft and Díaz.|$|E
