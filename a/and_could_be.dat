5|$|A {{few years}} later, {{inspired}} by Madame de Genlis's Adèle et Théodore (1782), Trimmer commissioned sets of illustrations of the Bible {{for which she}} provided the commentary; she also published print/commentary sets of ancient history and British history. These various sets were very popular <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E

5|$|Siege towers <b>and</b> ladders <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{fitted with}} a long, narrow tilting beam at the top, gouged with a groove, so that hot oil <b>and</b> water <b>could</b> <b>be</b> poured down on the enemy {{defenders}} during an escalade.|$|R
5|$|A {{greenway}} and/or connecting trail along Leggetts Creek {{was proposed}} in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan in the early 2000s. The greenway would {{be known as the}} Leggetts Creek greenway. It could link to the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> extended to link to the Tunkhannock greenway. The South Abington Park and the Leggetts Creek Trail are in Chinchilla and the creek flows though the latter. Trestle Hole Park is also along the creek's lower reaches. The Dutch Gap Little League Field is located at Wells Street.|$|E
5|$|A {{mixture of}} 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns {{were used for}} close defence work, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fitted to {{pedestals}} at various points on the ship, primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one {{either side of the}} forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, Sydney carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely.|$|E
5|$|A small {{downhill}} {{ski area}} provided recreation for personnel and their dependents, {{operating on the}} base from the early 1960s until Loring's closure in 1994. This ski chalet also included a lighted skating rink <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to host events in the area. The base also offered trips to regional ski resorts periodically, and cross country skiing was offered at the local golf course.|$|E

5|$|According to Walter Breen, Snowden {{most likely}} chose the {{combination}} of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected to strike well. On November 4, 1858, Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design, and two days later wrote to Longacre, informing him that it was approved. Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production, which was to begin on January 1, 1859.|$|E
5|$|After {{their success}} {{in the first month}} of the war, mass {{production}} was ordered and the development of other models proceeded. The Katyusha was inexpensive <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> manufactured in light industrial installations which did not have the heavy equipment to build conventional artillery gun barrels. By the end of 1942, 3,237 Katyusha launchers of all types had been built, {{and by the end of}} the war total production reached about 10,000.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft could undergo maintenance, {{and most}} {{functional}} and equipment tests carried out aboard - {{either in the}} hangar or on the deck. Some components <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> repaired on board, but other work was {{to be carried out}} by the workshops on the engine repair and component repair ships that would accompany the maintenance carrier.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart {{became friends}} with C. W. Post, who was a patient at the sanitarium, but Post was healed by a Christian Science faith healer, Mrs Elizabeth K. Gregory. In 1892, Post started La Vita Inn, a sanitarium {{of his own and}} brought Beilhart on as an associate. The two men took {{instruction}} in Christian Science. Both Post and Beilhart rejected the doctrine of the religion but they embraced the view that illness was an illusion <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> overcome by mental suggestion, prayer, and self-sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the explosive bolts used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Both authors {{wrote that}} the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe, and {{stressed}} that the parrots of each Caribbean island were distinct, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> differentiated both based on their morphology and their vocalizations. According to Hume, {{this means that the}} birds described could not simply have been escaped South American macaws. Furthermore, the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tertre and Labat does not match the behavior of South American macaws.|$|E

5|$|But in the {{following}} seven months, Cairano records successive advances and balances for trophies in full production mode that does not affect his other works, whereas Tamagnino only realises two Caesars and seventeen leonine busts. The creation of leonine busts was considered repetitive <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> consigned to low calibre stonecutters, and Tamagnino was paid {{much less than the}} average payment received by Cairano for artefacts of the same type.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had {{a light and}} a heavy attack, which could be {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was {{that it had not}} been tested <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, Loving {{returned}} to the Philippines and resumed command of the Philippine Constabulary Band for three years before retiring a second time, moving with his wife, Edith, to Oakland, California. In Oakland, Loving found success in real estate speculation. Because attitudes in Oakland at the time made African American ownership of property in some portions of the city problematic, Loving would dress in a chauffeur's uniform and drive Edith, who had a light complexion <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> mistaken for Caucasian, to view property.|$|E
