40|$|A {{knowledge}} of land su$ace temperature (LST) is strongly required for many applications, notably <b>agro-meteorology,</b> climate, and environmental studies. Satellite remote sensing {{in the infrared}} provides an interesting al-ternative for the global and continuous measurements of this parameter. Two main problems arise {{in the use of}} remote sensing data for evaluation of LST. These are the atmospheric effect and the land emissivity eflect. Difler-ent algorithms have been developed to correct these two efiects. In this work we present the results of a compara-tive test of LST algorithms. We have used AVHRR im-ages corresponding to a flat homogeneous region charac-terized by the presence of natural grassland with patches of bare soil. The images cover difierent seasons, thus allowing for changes in su$ace in vegetation emissivity due to changes cover. The results show that the Ulivieri et al. algorithm and the Price algorithm are statistically in-di,stinguishable, according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These two algorithms provide LST estimates close to su 7 face temperature used as ground data. We have tested also the algorithm proposed by Kerr et al., which use,s a ‘surrogate ” for the emissivity, the NDVI based on the visible- and ‘ near-infrared radiances measured by the AVHRR j&s two channels.

40|$|International audienceThis {{communication}} {{presents a}} new operational service providing archives and recent daily doses of UV. Thisservice {{has been set}} up on the SoDa website (www. soda-pro. com) to answer numerous requirements from users invarious applications in human health, <b>agro-meteorology,</b> phenology, or water quality. The UV dose is computed from the shortwave downwelling radiation at surface, also known as broadband solarradiation, using the already published method of Wald. This method has the advantage to be independent from thegeographical location. The operational service exploits the broadband irradiation data contained in the HelioClim- 3 version 5 database (HC 3 v 5). HC 3 v 5 is constructed from Meteosat images and makes use of the estimates of thebroadband irradiations in cloud-free conditions provided by the McClear service, within the Copernicus Atmo-sphere Monitoring Service of the European Union. HC 3 v 5 covers Europe, Africa, the Middle East, the Arabianpeninsula, the Atlantic ocean and part of South America. The new service provides daily doses of UV from 2004 up to current day- 2. It benefits from the wide audiencereceived by the SoDa Service, whose reliability and robustness has been enhanced by mirroring approach and in-vestment in computer resources. Four examples provided by users are given to illustrate the benefit of the service. In example 1, the atmospheric effects on humans, and more precisely the link between UV radiation and Parkinsondisease were addressed. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate that UV-B exposure, as a surrogate for vitaminD levels, contributes to prevent from Parkinson disease. Example 2 deals with the characterization of the climate for three sites in the Lubéron, a mountainous area ofFrance, where a particular plant: “inula montana” is found. The influence of several meteorological variables onthis plant was studied, including UV doses. Example 3 presents a study on the synthesis of protective compounds such as flavonoids in plants as a biologicalresponse to abiotic stressors such as UV radiation and other meteorological variables in coastal areas in the IberianPeninsula. The study particularly addresses the color of iris flowers, as an answer to stress. Example 4 reports on the development and toxicity of algae blooms in the Villerest water reservoir in France. Thestudy was originally based on broadband radiation. Preliminary results lead the authors to pay attention to UV-Bradiation, which was made possible with the new service...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the slope wind caused by cool air near the ground surface of a slope at clear nights furnishes an interesting problem in micro-meteorology, {{and at the same}} time is one of the principal subjects in <b>agro-meteorology,</b> as it apt to generate local differences of low temperature and to cause frost damage on crops especially in cold season. Many investigations on slope wind have been carried out, but it seems that most of them have been founded on only surface observations. Hence the author tried to make observations not only in the surface layer but also in the layer up to the height of about 250 m, and to deduce some conclusions about the slope wind and allied phenomena. The observations were carried out chiefly at a small island (Hakatajima Island in the Inland Sea of Seto), whose area is about 22 km^ 2 and maximum height is about 304 m from the mean sea level, and partly at a large slope of a mountain (Ogi-yama, Beppu City, Oita Pref.) in order to obtain some comparative data. Though these observations were made from 1949 to 1964, only the results of 1961 - 1963 are given as the objects of investigation in this paper. The paper is made up of two parts, the first part deals chiefly with the {{phenomenon of}} the slope wind and may be said to be micro-meteorological, and the second part concerns with the temperature distribution associated with the slope wind and the frost damage on crops and hence has a character of <b>agro-meteorology.</b> The results of t h e observations are summarized as follows: /A. Concerning the slope wind itself/ (1) The down slope wind on clear and calm nights arises immediately after sunset and lasts till the sun rises next morning, so long as there is no remarkable change in weather condition. The wind velocity, in many cases, is one meter per second and the wind goes on blowing at an almost constant speed all night long. (2) The depth of the down wind layer in a small valley is 25 - 30 meters thick, and the air temperature there falls till about 4 ℃, the maximum wind velocity being generally found in the five meters height. (3) The down slope wind found on ridges of either side of a valley and also in the upper part of the valley itself is weaker in strength and more irregular than that in the valley, but has the characteristics of down slope wind blowing down along the slope, the thickness being small and not constant. (4) The observed down slope wind coincides with Prandtl 2 ̆ 7 s theory either in regard to the vertical distribution or to the magnitude of its maximum value, but the observed air temperature distribution does not agree with the theory. The reason for the discrepancy is not easy to explain the fact that, though the theory treats the two-dimensional phenomenon, it is three-dimensional in the actual case, seems at present to be the only possibility of explanation. /B. Concerning the influence of the general wind upon the d own slope wind/ (1) When the general wind rises in the inverse direction, the inversion layer grows weak and the velocity of the down slope wind falls. The relation between velocities of the winds is generally expressed by a negative linear function, and when the general wind attains to the velocity of about 1. 5 m/s, the down slope wind disappears. (2) Similar relation holds also when the general wind rises in the same direction with the down slope wind, i. e., the latter grows weaker as the former becomes more remarkable. The wind velocity in the valley reaches a minimum and after then increases, showing that the general wind predominates also in the valley. /C. Concerning the circulation of the down slope wind/ Synthesizing the results of the wind in and above a valley of the north-west peninsula at Hakatajima, a return current against the down slope wind was evidently found to exist. As the wind velocity was very weak (less than 1. 0 meters per second) and easily disappeared when the general wind intervenes, the domain of the return current was difficult to decide exactly, however, the height of its lower and upper limits seemed to exist between 50 - 110 m and 100 - 180 m respectively above the coastal region. 晴夜の斜面上の地表付近で発生する冷却空気によつて生ずる斜面下降風は,物理的には対流の一相であつて興味深いが,それらに関連して生ずる夜間接地気温の局地的な気温差は,冬季における農作物の低温障害並びに凍霜害等に関連して,農業経営の合理化の上から極めて重要な問題である. 我々の観測並びに調査は,主に瀬戸内海にある伯方島(Lat. 34 ° 142 ̆ 7 N,Long. 133 ° 052 ̆ 7 E) で行なわれたが,比較資料を得るために別府市扇山斜面等においても実施した. なお,これらの観測・研究は 1949 年より 1964 年に及んでいるが,主体となつている観測は 1961 年より 1963 年の間に行なわれたものである. 次にこれらの観測の概要を説明する. (1) 静穏な晴夜における斜面下降風は日没後直ちに発生し,特別な変化のない限り日の出まで続き,地表付近の風速は多くの場合 1 m/s内外で,夜中大した変化もなくほとんど定速で吹き続いている. (2) 斜面下降風の厚さは 20 m- 30 mで,気温低下は地表付近までに約 4 ℃であり,風速の最大は大体 5 m層に現われている. (3) 側壁の稜線上及び谷に入るまでの上流部における斜面下降風は,谷間のものよりも弱勢でかつ不規則であるが,斜面下降風の特性をそなえ,斜面にそうて流下しており,その厚さは一定でないが相当うすく, 10 m以下であると思われる. (4) 斜面下降風の観測結果はPrandtlの理論とよく一致する. しかし温度分布の方は一致しない. これは理論は二次元的現象を取扱つているのに対し,実際には三次元的な要素が影響しているためではないかと考えられる. 1961 年に行なつた観測結果の中で,斜面下降風に対する一般風の影響を要約して説明すると次のごとくなる. (i) 晴夜であつて一般風の介入がなければ斜面下降風は定常的に全夜吹きつづき,系統的な流出時刻は見当らない. (ii) 斜面下降風が発達しているときに一般風が発生すると,逆転屠が弱まつて下降風の風速が低下し,両者の風速の関係はほぼ負の一次関係で表わされるとみてよく,一般風が 1. 5 m/sぐらいに達すると斜面下降風は停止する. (iii) 斜面下降風の背面から一般風が吹き込む場合も上記の関係が成立することは興味深いが,これら事実はさらに多くの地形について観測した後で議論されなければならない. 伯方島にある谷で, 1962 年に行なつた観測結果の中で,斜面下降風によつておこる循環系についての問題を要約するとつぎのようになる. (i) 伯方島の北西部半島上の谷状地における,地上 250 m高度までの風の観測結果を総合して,かなり明瞭な下降風に対する帰還流の存在することがわかつた. 風速は微弱(1. 0 m/s以下) であつて弱い一般風の介入によつて容易に消失し,厚さ等を正確に決定することは困難であるが,海岸における帰還流の下限の高さは 50 m- 110 m,上限は 100 - 180 mの間で変化しているようである...|$|E
40|$|When Samuel Morse {{invented the}} {{telegraph}} in 1843, meteorologists {{were among the}} first to promote the new technology, as it allowed them to communicate weather observations over large distances in real time. Today, meteorologists continue to be at the forefront of technological innovation, using the latest ICTs to collect, analyze and communicate weather information. Agrometeorologists, who specialize in agricultural applications of weather and climate information, are no exception. This issue of ICT Update illustrates a number of ICTs that are playing a crucial role in the agrometeorologists´ efforts to help farmers improve production, mitigate the impacts of natural hazards, and cope with climate variability and change. The first example relates to the main objective of <b>agro-meteorology</b> - to provide weather information to farmers. There are still many farmers in ACP countries who have limited or no access to reliable weather forecasts to help them plan their activities. Reidner Mumbi and Kelly Sponberg report how RANET is using low-cost satellite radio technology and a network of local radio stations to broadcast weather reports to farmers in the remotest areas. In another example of satellite technology, John Stephenson and Jim Williams describe how low-cost satellite reception systems are making real time weather and climate data more accessible to local natural resource managers. Such satellite receiver systems are getting cheaper, but the same cannot be said of the latest meteorological satellite programme of the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT. Anne Taube explains how the programme will benefit national meteorological services throughout Africa. Pest forecasting is another important area of agrometeorology. Under the right environmental conditions, such as rainfall, wind direction and humidity, insect pest populations can explode, with devastating effects. Keith Cressman explains how the FAO´s eLocust system - a palmtop computer, GPS device and HF radio equipment that run on a car battery is being used to monitor and to provide early warning of outbreaks of desert locusts in the Sahel. In the Caribbean, agrometeorology is above all concerned with natural hazard mitigation. Hurricanes and floods can and often do cause extensive damage to fisheries, farms, and island economies in general. Terry Ally explains how the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA) is compiling a catalogue of digital hazard maps that will enable planners to assess flood risks, and small farmers to make sound business decisions. Kees Stigter, one of the world´s leading agrometeorologists, concludes with a cautionary note. He reminds us that ICTs are extremely useful tools, but when it comes to the provision of agrometeorological services to poor farmers, the starting point should always be the technologies and adaptive strategies they have developed themselves.

40|$|In {{the part}} I {{of this paper}} I have {{described}} the method of observation on the slope wind in the night carried out chiefly at a small island (Hakatajima Island in the Inland Sea of Seto) and partly at a large slope of a mountain (Ogi-yama, Beppu City, Oita Pref.), and the obtained results from the micro-meteorological point of view. Now in this part II, I shall explain mainly my observation on temperature distribution associated with the slope wind and the frost damage on crops {{from the point of}} view of <b>agro-meteorology.</b> Obtained results are summarized as follows: (1) At each bottom of the northern and southern slopes a low temperature zone due to the cooling layer was observed to exist. But the depths of the cold airs were different, i. e., less than 10 meters and more than 50 meters respectively, probably due to the fact that the northern slope was connected to the sea, and the southern slope to a small basin where a cold air lake was formed. (2) On each slope, a high temperature zone was observed, height ranges being 30 - 80 meters on the northern slope and 60 - 110 meters on the southern slope respectively. (3) Observed number of frosty days on the southern slope amounted to more than 30 in a year at the foot of the slope, and decreasing gradually upward till it began to increase again near the top of the hill. A frostless zone was observed at the height of 90 - 100 meters above the sea level, quite in agreement with the high temperature zone. (4) It is known in the Inland Sea of Seto that the occurrence of frost damage of Pelargonium species coincides very well with the distribution of frost-fall, and they should be cultivated in areas where frosty days never exceed 16 - 20. But it was made clear from our observations that when the average temperature fell to 3 ℃ and the average wind velocity reached 5. 3 meters per second in the coldest month owing to the outbreak of an unusually cold wave, etc., wintering was impossible in almost all the area. (5) It is usual in the area of the Inland Sea of Seto that the low temperature damage on the mandarin orange is comparatively small and ignored from the economical point of view. But under a certain condition of the unusually low temperature such as January to March in 1963, the low temperature damage was remarkable. The states of damage distribution in the Inland seemed to be coincided with our results of the observation on cooling layer and air temperature. 晴夜において斜面上で冷却した空気は低地に流下し,そのために谷間等ではいちじるしく低温となる. 地理的条件等によつて異なるが,高度差 70 mぐらいの谷間と尾根上で,気温差が 4 ℃以上に達することはまれでない. このような局地的気温差は,前篇で説明した冷却層の影響によつて生ずると考えてよく,降霜分布の傾向もそれらとよく一致している. 本篇では農業気象的な立場からこれらの問題を究明することとする. 瀬戸内海の伯方島(Lat. 34 ° 14 ’N,Long. 133 ° 05 ’E) にある小さな丘状地で, 1960 年から 1962 年かけて,晴夜における冷却層の性状と,それによつて生ずる接地気温又は降霜状況等の局地性に関する観測を行なつた. これらの結果を要約すると次の如くなる. (1) 小丘状地(120 m M. S. L.) の北斜面下方は海に接し,南斜面下方は小盆地となつており,両斜面の下方にそれぞれ冷却層による低温域が見られるが,海に接する北斜面の冷却層の厚さは 10 m以下であるのに対して,南斜面下方の盆地では冷気湖を形成し,冷却層の厚さは 50 mに達している. (2) 南斜面では海抜 110 m,北斜面では 80 m以上の高度から気温の逓減が初まつている. 従つて南斜面の 60 - 110 m,北斜面の 30 - 80 mの地域はそれぞれ高温地帯となつている. (3) 両斜面とも上方の高温帯と低地の低温部との接地気温差は 4. 5 - 5. 0 ℃ に及び,又南斜面下方では年間降霜日数が 30 日を越すが,丘頂近くの海抜 90 - 100 mの間は無霜地帯となつている. 瀬戸内海地域におけるゼラニウムの凍霜害発生状況は降霜分布の状態と非常によく一致しており,降霜日数 16 - 20 日以下の地域で栽培することが越冬の第 1 条件であるが,異常寒波等により最低月の月平均気温が 3 ℃,月平均風速が 5. 3 m/Sに達すると,ほとんどすべての地域において越冬が不可能であつた. 瀬戸内海地域における例年の柑橘の低温障害の程度は,経済的水準において無視してよいと思われる. 然し 1963 年 1 ・ 2 ・ 3 月の異常低温の条件下では低温障害が目立ち,島内における被害の分布状況は夜間冷却層,接地気温分布の観測結果と関連が見られるが,季節風の風圧による機械的作用も,低温障害発生に関係していると思われる...|$|E
