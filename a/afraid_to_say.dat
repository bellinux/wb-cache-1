500|$|Pleased {{with his}} success in London, Clarke {{returned}} to Lisbon on [...] posing as a journalist for The Times named [...] "Wrangal Craker". His aim was {{to carry on the}} semi-undercover work of spreading rumours and misinformation to the Germans. Later that month, in Madrid, he was arrested while dressed as a woman. Guy Liddell, wartime counter-espionage head at MI5, said of the incident: [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that after his stay in Lisbon as a bogus journalist he has got rather over-confident about his powers as an agent." [...] Clarke was released, apparently at the behest of a German contact who believed him to be [...] "an important agent who was ready to assist the Germans", and made his way to Gibraltar.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

500|$|Hilson {{later told}} Jocelyn Vena of MTV News {{that she was}} indeed a little bit {{surprised}} by the reaction she was getting concerning [...] "The Way You Love Me". She clarified that the song was not just sexual: [...] "In that record I'm talking about one guy, I'm talking about one night {{and this is what}} I want on this one night, and I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} met with general acclaim from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's [...] "expansive {{vocabulary}} and vivid imagination", adding that [...] "Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP {{one of the great}} debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's [...] "unapologetic outrageousness" [...] as a reaction to the [...] "soul positivity" [...] of conscious hip hop, noting that [...] "The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch." [...] Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that [...] "He isn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time" [...] but lamented the [...] "sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{concerning}} the scientific {{content of the}} conference, we had also to struggle with considerable difficulties. Unfortunately, there were not only leading scientists present, but also some colleagues who used the conference to express personal, political opinions based on value judgement instead of scientific facts and rigorously derived, scientific insights and thorough understanding. Thereby, I believe, principles of proper scientific conduct were violated too often and sometimes, I am <b>afraid</b> having <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so, even systematically. This contrasts sharply with the principles upheld by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which allow only to assess the current knowledge based on the best available, peer reviewed scientific literature and which do not allow for any non-scientific value judgements, let alone policy recommendations. http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/WCCC2003.html ...|$|R

2500|$|Love and Erlandson {{began writing}} new {{material}} for a second Hole album in 1992, {{in the midst of}} Love's pregnancy with Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. Love's desire to take the band in a more melodic and controlled rock format led bassist Emery to leave the band, and drummer Caroline Rue followed. In an advertisement to find a new bass player, Love wrote: [...] " [...] someone who can play ok, and stand in front of 30,000 people, take off her shirt and have 'fuck you' written on her tits. If you're not afraid of me and you're not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> fucking <b>say</b> it, send a letter. No more pussies, no more fake girls, I want a whore from hell."

500|$|As {{a college}} prospect, Rivals.com ranked him 30th nationally among dual-threat quarterbacks, Scouts, Inc. ranked him 33rd nationally among wide receivers, and SuperPrep placed him on its Virginia 33. ESPN {{assessed}} {{him as a}} [...] "do-it-all prospect" [...] and projected him as a wide receiver because of his size and speed. Smith was recruited by Maryland, Penn State, and Virginia Tech. He was shown interest by Virginia, but did not receive a scholarship offer. The Virginia staff, which questioned whether he had recovered his speed after a basketball injury during his junior year, asked Smith to run a 4.5-second 40-yard dash at a Nike combine at Clemson University, which he did. The Virginia staff then asked him to repeat the feat at the University of Virginia campus, but Maryland offered a scholarship, which Smith accepted. He later said, [...] "I kind of hold a grudge against U.Va. a little bit. I'm not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it. I kind of want {{to show them that}} they questioned my speed and whether I was going to get it back. I want to show them that I'm all healed up." [...] Virginia head coach Al Groh said of the Fredericksburg native before the 2009 game against Maryland, [...] "Clearly if we [...] him being the type of player that he is now, he would be returning kicks for Virginia. So we are not above admitting that there is a player that certainly {{has turned out to be}} superior to what many people thought, including ourselves. He's—regardless of what the circumstances were in the past—he is a superior college football player." ...|$|E
500|$|Milian {{wrote the}} hip-hop ballad [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] about [...] "thinking that I had {{something}} good, {{what happens when}} it's over, and going forward with my life." [...] The track {{was one of the}} final songs that Milian wrote about the break-up as it [...] "helped me get it all out". While the record is about a break-up, it focuses more on closure and moving past it. Milian and Cool & Dre used the melody of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony song [...] "Tha Crossroads" [...] and changed the lyrics [...] "and I'm gonna miss everybody" [...] to [...] "and I'm gonna tell everybody". The other song, [...] "Who's Gonna Ride", has a more street and gangster vibe, and contain more raw lyrics. Milian wrote the track with Dre, which she said helped because hip hop artists write about real things in their lives and are not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything. While writing the track, Milian let her guard down and wrote what she was feeling and tried to be real. Lyrically, the song also deals with [...] "the girls that come around and try to take your man. Or the groupie girls that are around, paying attention to the guys on TV that only hang out with them for those reasons." [...] Milian also said [...] "Who's Gonna Ride" [...] was the hardest song to write because it was not safe, unlike previous songs she had written. The singer explained writing the lyrics was not hard, but the difficulty came from being real and actually writing about her true feelings. When writing the lyrics, Milian removed several lines that she thought were too harsh.|$|E
500|$|Just {{like the}} text—which was mostly written {{on top of}} {{photographs}}—the photographs on the book are highly sexual and depict nudity, [...] simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, full intercourse is never shown. Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami. The book also reflects a great part on Dita's perspective towards her own sexuality. Dita writes in Sex that her [...] "pussy" [...] is a temple of learning and that exposing it, is really a homage to it ("It's hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life"). Sex contains statements like [...] "ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too". Others include [...] "here is something comforting about being tied up. Like {{when you were a}} baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain". In Sex, Dita also pointed out that [...] "A lot of people are <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what they want. That's why they don't get what they want". The book includes Madonna's perspective on pornography: ...|$|E

In July 2013, in an interview with entertainment.ie, Questlove spoke about how the album started, saying: [...] "Elvis first came on the Jimmy Fallon show in 2009. I knew he was a fan of the Voodoo album I did with D'Angelo, so we asked if he would be open to the idea of “remixing” his stuff. He was into it, so we did these radical versions of [...] "High Fidelity" [...] and [...] "(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea", and he loved it. Then we did that a second time the next year, and then last year he was on when the show did a Bruce Springsteen tribute week.At that point, I kinda subliminally put out the idea of a larger collaboration.

2500|$|During a Playboy {{interview}} in 1992, Williams {{was asked whether}} he ever feared losing his balance between his work and his life.

If I stop trying, I get afraid." [...] While he attributed the recent suicide of novelist Jerzy Kosiński to his fear of losing his creativity and sharpness, Williams felt he could overcome those risks. For that, he credited his father for strengthening his self-confidence, telling him to never be afraid of talking about subjects which were important to him.|$|E

DeDe {{was unhappy with}} the relationship, {{but was unable to}} {{influence}} her daughter to end it. She expected the romance to burn out in a few weeks, but that did not happen. After about a year, DeDe tried to separate them by using Lucille's desire to be in show business. Despite the family's meager finances, she arranged for Lucille to go to the John Murray Anderson School for the Dramatic Arts in New York City, where Bette Davis was a fellow student. Ball later said about that time in her life, [...] "All I learned in drama school was how to be frightened."

I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much to stand there singing this song that does my head in and to stand there singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E
