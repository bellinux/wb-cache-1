5|$|On 11 April 1939 he {{narrowly}} {{escaped with}} his life alongside Geoffrey de Havilland; both men parachuting to safety. They had taken a Moth Minor into the air to test its response to spins. The prototypes had an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> but preceding tests had been carried out without the need to resort to the safety measure. Geoffrey put the aircraft into a left-hand spin which was recovered. Climbing back to 8,000 feet the aircraft was put into it a right-hand spin. The engine cut out, the nose reared-up and the aircraft stalled and entered a flat spin. Geoffrey asked John through the Gosport tube to try to escape their perilous situation after the controls proved non-responsive to de Havilland's efforts. Both decided to parachute out. Upon doing so the Moth declined its nose and recovered from the spin. The engine ignition had been left on and the wind-milling propeller started the engine. The aircraft began circling the descending airmen at dangerously close range. Fortunately it descended {{at a faster rate}} and was destroyed when it hit the ground. Cunningham casually took pictures of the wreckage and his parachute which exemplified his cool nature.|$|E

This was offered to Argentina {{as a replacement for}} its obsolete Dewoitine D.21s. When it came to be tested in Argentina, Curtiss-Wright representatives, eager to sell the Curtiss 75, pointed out that the Vought was fitted with an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> in the tail.

On 8 December 1955, a service test pilot S/L Dick was testing XA561 for the A when the aircraft entered a flat spin during manoeuvres, which the <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> could not stop, and he ejected. Following this, a stall-warning device was developed for the Javelin.|$|E

5000|$|The only FD1 to be {{completed}} was built at Fairey's Heaton Chapel Stockport factory and taken by road to their test facility at Manchester's Ringway Airport for final assembly. Starting on 12 May 1950 it made several high-speed taxi runs down the 4,200-foot main runway there before being partially dismantled and transported by road to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (AAEE) at RAF Boscombe Down. After further taxi tests, the aircraft (serial number VX350) made its maiden flight on 12 March 1951, flown by Fairey test pilot Group Captain Gordon Slade. The FD1 was fitted with a small horizontal delta-shaped control surface {{on the top of}} the tail-fin which was intended to stop the [...] "serious pitching as it gathered speed." [...] Continued testing pointed to serious stability problems that were characterized as [...] "dangerous." [...] The additional tail surface limited the top speed to a relatively pedestrian 345 mph (555 km/h). After a landing accident in September 1951, the FD1 was modified with the removal of the temporary slots as well as the removal of the streamlined housings for the <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachutes</b> that were mounted at the wingtips.

50|$|Among the new devices {{incorporated}} {{within the}} FDB-1 was an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> in its tail cone. The pilot activated the parachute {{from the cockpit}} by a three-position switch. The first opened the cone, the second deployed the chute behind the aircraft, and the third released the connecting cable.|$|E
50|$|The {{competing}} bids {{were evaluated by}} the Air Corps in April 1936. Vought offered to sell V-141s at a unit price of $34,148 for a batch of 25 aircraft (excluding engines and Government provided equipment), reducing to $16,041 for a batch of 200 aircraft. Testing showed that the V-141 still had poor handling and was prone to spinning, and also suffered from tail flutter, leading to the Vought design being rejected. The primary winner of the competition was Seversky, with 77 P-35s being ordered. Vought then decided to offer its fighter for export, modifying it with larger tail surfaces and renaming it the Vought V-143. This was offered to Argentina {{as a replacement for}} its obsolete Dewoitine D.21s. When it came to be tested in Argentina, Curtiss-Wright representatives, eager to sell the Curtiss 75, pointed out that the Vought was fitted with an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> in the tail.

50|$|The P.111A first flew on 2 July 1953 from Boscombe Down. Shortly {{afterwards}} the <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> {{mounted on}} the rear port fuselage was strengthened {{so it could be}} deployed as a braking parachute and the pilot was given control over the strength of the power controls. It was used by the RAE in a series of explorations of delta wing characteristics and later based at RAE Bedford. During this time it flew with each of the three wing tips.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly after 18:30, {{the pilot}} {{reported}} that the aircraft was in a [...] "superstall". At the time, the aircraft was observed to be configured for landing. [...] It was {{at an altitude of}} 10000 ft. The nose was seen to pitch up by 30 to 40° before the aircraft turned to port, followed by the starboard wing dropping. Although full power was applied, the aircraft entered into a flat spin, and crashed at Felthorpe, killing all on board. It was not fitted with an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute.</b> The site of the accident was in a field adjacent to Felthorpe Airfield.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "deep stall" [...] {{first came}} into {{widespread}} use after {{the crash of the}} prototype BAC 1-11 G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew. This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a stick shaker (see below) to clearly warn the pilot of an impending stall. Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a Hawker Siddeley Trident (G-ARPY), was lost to deep stall; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the British European Airways Flight 548 G-ARPI) crash - known as the [...] "Staines Disaster" [...] - on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system. On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the Canadair Challenger business jet crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000 ft and having both engines flame-out. It recovered from the deep stall after deploying the <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> but crashed after being unable to jettison the chute or relight the engines. One of the test pilots was unable to escape from the aircraft in time and was killed. On the 26 July 1993, a Canadair CRJ-100 was lost in flight testing due to a deep stall. It has been reported that a Boeing 727 entered a deep stall in a flight test, but the pilot was able to rock the airplane to increasingly higher bank angles until the nose finally fell through and normal control response was recovered. [...] A 727 accident on 1 December 1974, has also been attributed to a deep stall. The crash of West Caribbean Airways Flight 708 in 2005 was also attributed to a deep stall.|$|E
40|$|A device which corrects {{aerodynamic}} spin {{is provided}} in which a collapsible boom extends an aircraft moment arm and an <b>anti-spin</b> <b>parachute</b> force is exerted upon {{the end of the}} moment arm to correct intentional or inadvertent aerodynamic spin. This configuration effects spin recovery by means of a parachute whose required diameter decreases as an inverse function of the increasing length of the moment arm. The collapsible boom enables the parachute to avoid the aircraft wake without mechanical assistance, retracts to permit steep takeoff, and permits a parachute to correct spin while minimizing associated aerodynamic, structural and in-flight complications...|$|E
