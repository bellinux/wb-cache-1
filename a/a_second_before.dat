5|$|The franchise's first {{manager was}} Hall of Famer John McGraw, who managed {{the team for}} one year and part of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> {{becoming}} manager of the New York Giants. In 1903, the team moved from Baltimore to New York, where it was initially known as the New York Highlanders. Its first manager in New York was Clark Griffith, who managed the team from 1903 to 1908. Miller Huggins was the next manager to manage the team {{for more than three}} seasons. Huggins took over the managerial duties in 1918 and led the Yankees to six American League championships and three World Series titles until his death in 1929. Huggins won 1,067 regular season games with the Yankees, which ranks fourth all-time among Yankee managers.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Yamaha {{introduced}} a new square-four cylinder bike, similar to Suzuki's RG500. Roberts raced to a second-place finish behind Marco Luchinelli at the non-championship Imola 200 race. Roberts' bike had a suspension failure in the Grand Prix season opener at Austria, but he rebounded to win the next two races in Germany and Italy. Roberts' title hopes suffered a setback at the Dutch TT at Assen when his Yamaha's front brake pads were installed incorrectly causing his front wheel to lock up on the starting line, ending his race before it had started. He came back to score a second place behind Lucchinelli in Belgium, but was once again struck by misfortune when {{a bad case of}} food poisoning forced him to miss the San Marino Grand Prix. He then narrowly lost the British Grand Prix to Jack Middelburg by three-tenths of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> ending his season with a seventh place in Finland and a retirement in Sweden. Suzuki team riders Mamola and Lucchinelli battled to the final race of the season before the Italian claimed the championship with a total of five Grand Prix victories, with Mamola finishing in second and Roberts in third place.|$|E
5|$|Massa made a {{pit stop}} on lap53, and rejoined behind Heidfeld in tenth. He {{subsequently}} set the fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap55, a 1:18.426. Meanwhile, Piquet was able {{to close the gap}} on Räikkönen to under <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>before</b> losing time by running wide at turn five on lap60. Massa passed Heidfeld for ninth on the same lap, and began closing in on Webber. On lap65, Massa drafted down the straight and attempted to pass Webber, who defended his position by driving to the right. Crossing the track boundary into the end of the pit-lane, Massa managed to pass Webber, and out-braked him into turn one, to take eighth place. Alonso crossed the finish line on lap67 to take his second win of the season, five seconds ahead of Kubica. Räikkönen was third, ahead of Piquet, Trulli, Bourdais, Vettel and Massa. Webber took ninth on the line, ahead of Heidfeld, who struggled with a heavy car and failed to improve on a poor qualifying performance. Rosberg finished in front of Hamilton, in 11th. Barrichello and Button took the next two positions; both drivers blamed their Honda cars for their uncompetitive performance at the Fuji circuit. Nakajima finished last, in 15th, unable to recover after his forced pit-stop early in the race.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>before</b> the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
25|$|The {{depiction}} of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art is often related to Biblical narrative. Examples are Joachim's Dream (1304–1306) from the Scrovegni Chapel fresco cycle by Giotto, and Jacob's Dream (1639) by Jusepe de Ribera. Dreams and dark imaginings are {{the theme of}} several notable works of the Romantic era, such as Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters (c. 1799) and Henry Fuseli's painting The Nightmare (1781). Salvador Dalí's Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate <b>a</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Before</b> Awakening (1944) also investigates this theme through absurd juxtapositions of a nude lady, tigers leaping out of a pomegranate, and a spider-like elephant walking in the background. Henri Rousseau's last painting was The Dream. Le Rêve ("The Dream") is a 1932 painting by Pablo Picasso.|$|E
25|$|The first {{distress}} call {{had been made}} just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 04:39 pm and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 04:51 pm. None of the calls had gone through {{due to a lack}} of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 am and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any more calls either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false PIN code were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between the 7th and 10th of April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, the phone was turned on at 10:51 am, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56 am.|$|E

25|$|After tea Australia {{continued}} {{to settle into}} their batting rhythm as Hussey reached his 50 in the 64th over. England began to lose the advantage they had established early in the day, with runs coming more easily to Australia. In the 73rd over Hussey survived a dramatic run out chance {{which had to be}} referred to the third umpire as he slid his bat back into his crease a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> Geraint Jones broke the stumps off a James Anderson throw-in. It was not until after the new ball had been taken in the 83rd over that England got a breakthrough. Matthew Hoggard was again the successful bowler, claiming Ponting for 142 and later Hussey for 91 in the 91st over. After the fall of Hussey's wicket, Michael Clarke and Adam Gilchrist established themselves at the crease to end the day on 30 and 13 respectively. The Australian score was 312 for 5, 40 runs short of the follow-on target.|$|E
500|$|The teams {{played an}} intense {{overtime}} period filled with end-to-end rushes and brilliant saves by the goaltenders. [...] At one point, Canada's Guy Lafleur put a shot on net that snuck through the Czechoslovak goaltender, but Ivan Hlinka deliberately shoved the net {{out of place}} before the puck crossed the line. [...] He received a delay of game penalty, but prevented a Canadian win. [...] A few moments later, Guy Lapointe rifled a low shot that again beat Dzurilla, however this goal was also disallowed as the buzzer had sounded to end the first ten-minutes of the overtime period one-tenth of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> it crossed the line. International rules of the time dictated that play was to be stopped at the ten-minute mark of each overtime period and the teams would switch {{the side of the}} ice they defended. [...] During the break, Canadian assistant coach Don Cherry noted to his team that Dzurilla often came far out of his net to defend and could be beaten on a shot from a sharp angle.|$|E
500|$|... 2004 {{opened with}} a Derby de Lisboa against Sporting on 4 January. Benfica conceded an early goal, after Moreira fouled Silva inside the box. Sporting added <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> half-time and closed the match with another {{converted}} penalty; winning 3–1 and increasing their lead over Benfica to four points. On 11 January, Benfica visited União de Leiria at the newly developed Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa. In a tightly contested match, Benfica fell behind twice and briefly led on the 80th minute. However, Leiria equalized within two minutes and the match ended in a 3–3 draw. With five points lost in two games, {{the distance to the}} top was again 11 points, with 6 to second place. The game also marked the debut of Fyssas, a 30-year-old left-back hired to compete with Cristiano. A week later, Benfica beat Boavista 3–2 with two goals from Sokota. At the press conference, Camacho criticized the media's behaviour after two weeks of intense pressure due to previous results. On 25 January, Benfica closed the month with an away game at Vitória de Guimarães. They won the game with a late goal, but the match was more remembered for the collapse and later death of Miklós Fehér, who suffered a cardiac arrhythmia brought on by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The day after his death, Benfica announced they were permanently retiring his shirt number.|$|E

2500|$|The strings {{were played}} by small {{electric}} powered rollers, which were self-rosinating, and a chromatic set of metal 'fingers'. The violin had no finger board. A small metal [...] "finger", activated by an electromagnet, rose {{from under the}} string lifting it in a [...] "V" [...] shaped slot thus stopping off the string. The strings were bowed by four small wheels made of discs of celluloid clamped together in a dish-shaped form. These applied just the right pressure to the strings and were driven by a variable-speed controlled motor. This and a mute allowed the volume of sound produced to be varied. The violin produced a full tone {{and was able to}} sound 1/2 note double stops at ragtime tempi. The staccato coil allowed the bows to leave the string a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> the 'fingers'. The violin stayed in tune by a sophisticated array of tuning arms and weights. The vibrato was produced by using an electromagnet to shake the tail-piece of the violin.|$|E

2500|$|Before being widely {{adopted by}} human factors {{scientists}} in the 1990s, the term {{is said to have}} been used by United States Air Force (USAF) fighter aircrew returning from war in Korea and Vietnam. They identified having good SA as the decisive factor in air combat engagements—the [...] "ace factor". Survival in a dogfight was typically a matter of observing the opponent's current move and anticipating his next move a fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> he could observe and anticipate it himself. USAF pilots also came to equate SA with the [...] "observe" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] phases of the famous observe-orient-decide-act loop (OODA loop), or Boyd cycle, as described by the USAF war theorist Col. John Boyd. In combat, the winning strategy is to [...] "get inside" [...] your opponent's OODA loop, not just by making one's own decisions quicker, but also by having better SA than one's opponent, and even changing the situation in ways that the opponent cannot monitor or even comprehend. Losing one's own SA, in contrast, equates to being [...] "out of the loop".|$|E
2500|$|Blackpool Football Club {{were formed}} on 26 July 1887, through a {{breakaway}} {{group from the}} local St. John's F.C. Mike Jackman's Blackburn Rovers: A Complete Record, 1875–1990, published in 1990, makes reference to a game against [...] "Blackpool" [...] in December 1880, but whether this was today's club is not clear. The St. John's club had been in existence {{for a decade or}} so, risen from the ashes of the disbanded Victoria Club. Five members of the club — Revd. N.S. Jeffrey, Sam Bancroft, Dick Swanbrick, Dick Worthington and W.J. Brown — felt it was necessary for the town of Blackpool to have a football club bearing its name. After a disagreement with the other members regarding the possibility of having their name drop the denominational suffix and become a town team, the men left the meeting, went next door to the Stanley Arms Hotel, and immediately founded Blackpool Football Club. The remainder of the St. John's players eventually defected to join the new club, in turn making the former defunct. It was with these individuals that Blackpool F.C. played their first competitive game, at Dole Lane, the home of Chorley, in which they recorded a 2–1 victory. Hargreaves scored Blackpool's first-ever goal with [...] "a ponderous kick half the length of the field". Corry added <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>before</b> the hosts scored a late consolation.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kennedy's inquest testimony, {{he made a}} {{wrong turn}} onto Dike Road, which was an unlit dirt road that led to Dike Bridge (also spelled Dyke Bridge). Dike Road was unpaved, but Kennedy, driving at [...] "approximately twenty miles an hour [...] ", took [...] "no {{particular}} notice" [...] of that fact, and {{did not realize that}} he was no longer headed toward the ferry landing. Dike Bridge was a wooden structure that at the time was not protected by a guardrail and was angled obliquely to the road. A fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>before</b> he reached the bridge, Kennedy applied his brakes and then drove {{over the side of the}} bridge. The car plunged into tide-swept Poucha Pond (there a channel) and came to rest, upside down, underwater. Kennedy recalled later that he was able to swim free of the vehicle, but Kopechne was not. At the inquest, Kennedy claimed that he called Kopechne's name several times from the shore and tried to swim down to reach her seven or eight times. Knowing that the woman was still trapped inside the vehicle, Kennedy rested on the bank for around 15 minutes before he returned on foot to Lawrence Cottage, which was the site of the party that was attended by Kopechne and the other [...] "boiler room girls". Kennedy denied seeing any house with a light on during his walk back to Lawrence Cottage.|$|E
