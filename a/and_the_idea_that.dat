The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days {{at a cost of}} $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, William Sadler {{moved to}} Battle Creek, Michigan, {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where he served as a bellhop and helped in the kitchen. He also {{attended}} Battle Creek College for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> caffeine has negative health effects. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.|$|E

On his maiden flight, the German Army opened fire on his aircraft, and his right foot was pierced by bullets and badly injured. To recuperate, he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before {{being sent to the}} RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall. During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells's home in Dunmow, Essex, embracing the latter's desire for a united world government <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> writing about global history was a contribution to that cause. While at Heligan, Crawford began work on a book, Man and his Past, in which he examined a broad sweep of human history from an archaeological and geographical perspective.|$|E

5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a pastor should be accountable to elders; {{it is common for}} pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E

He used an epic structure to force the audience to focus on the issues rather than getting involved with the characters and their emotions. Epic plays are a distinct genre typical of Brecht.

The surveys also demonstrated that most recorded Satanists practiced magic, although there were differing opinions as to whether magical acts operated according to etheric laws or whether the effect of magic was purely psychological.

There are also myths about the Milky Way, ideas about the existence of the World tree or pillar, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> asterisms represent animal spirits.

25|$|Some {{texts of}} the Abhidharma state that a paṇḍaka cannot achieve {{enlightenment}} in their own lifetime, but must wait for reincarnation as a man or woman.

25|$|While often {{delegated}} {{to the field}} of astrobiology, attempts to understand how and when life arose are relevant to geobiology as well. The first major strides towards understanding the “how” came with the Miller-Urey experiment, when amino acids formed out of a simulated “primordial soup”. Another theory is that life originated in a system much like the hydrothermal vents at mid-oceanic spreading centers. In the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a variety of hydrocarbons form under vent-like conditions. Other ideas include the “RNA World” hypothesis, which postulates that the first biologic molecule was RNA <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> life originated elsewhere in the solar system and was brought to Earth, perhaps via a meteorite.|$|E
25|$|Atheism in {{the twentieth}} century found {{recognition}} {{in a wide variety of}} other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as existentialism, Objectivism, secular humanism, nihilism, logical positivism, Marxism, anarchism, feminism, and the general scientific and rationalist movement. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. H. L. Mencken sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.|$|E
