500|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Keynsham lies Keynsham Humpy Tumps, {{one of the most}} floristically rich acidic grassland sites within the Avon area. The site is on a south-facing slope running alongside the Bristol to Bath railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of scrub. It is the only site in Avon at which Upright Chickweed Moenchia erecta, occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include <b>Annual</b> <b>Knawel</b> Scleranthus annuus, Sand Spurrey Spergularia rubra, Subterranean Clover Trifolium subterraneus and Prickly Sedge Carex muricata ssp. lamprocarpa. The site does not have any statutory conservation status, and is not [...] managed for its biodiversity interest. Threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of scrub onto the grassland areas, and damage from motorcycle scrambling. Between Keynsham and Saltford, a [...] area of green belt has been planted, with over 19,000 trees, as the Manor Road Community Woodland, which has been designated as a Nature Reserve. Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction.|$|E

50|$|Small {{areas of}} chalk-heath {{vegetation}} occur on superficial clay-with-flints deposits. Here chalk-loving {{plants such as}} salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) and dropwort co-exist with plants typical of acid soils, including gorse (Ulex europaeus), heather (Calluna vulgaris) and the uncommon <b>annual</b> <b>knawel</b> (Scleranthus annuus). Two Red Data Book (RDB) plants occur on the plain. The largest population in Britain of tuberous thistle (Cirsium tuberosum) occurs on the western ranges and is notable for the low incidence of hybridisation with dwarf thistle, a contributory cause of its decline in other localities. Meadow clary (Salvia pratensis) persists as a small colony in tall upright brome grassland.|$|E
5000|$|Scleranthus annuus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the pink family known by the common names German knotweed and <b>annual</b> <b>knawel.</b> It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is known {{throughout the rest of}} the temperate world as an introduced species and a common weed. It grows in many types of habitat, often in disturbed areas. It is an annual herb with low, spreading stems up to 15 centimeters long growing from a taproot. The leaves are needle-like or linear in shape with sharp, stiff points. They are oppositely arranged in pairs about the stem and are fused together at the bases. Flowers occur in pairs or small clusters of up to five. The flowers lack petals but have bell-shaped calyces of green petal-shaped sepals.|$|E
