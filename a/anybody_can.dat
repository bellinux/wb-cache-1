25|$|AMS Performance, {{based in}} West Chicago, Illinois, has set record power levels and {{performance}} {{numbers for the}} GT-R. Their Alpha Omega GT-R puts down between 1700–1750 whp and boasts 0–60 times of 1.7 seconds according to their staff on their official Facebook page. In June 2013, Omega set multiple world records at the WannaGoFast 1/2 Mile Shootout at Built Field Airport in Monee, Illinois which included: 214.04mph in a standing 1/2 mile; 60–130mph in 3 seconds; 0–100mph in 4.4 seconds; 0–200mph in 11.87 seconds. In July 2013, AMS regained their world record (previously held by John Shepherd's AMS/Switzer GT-R for a brief time) when Omega ran 8.259 at 185.18mph. A few days later, OMEGA broke into the 7s when it ran a 7.98 at 186.14mph, currently making it the quickest and fastest GT-R in the world, {{as well as the}} first GT-R to reach the 9's, 8's, and 7's. During the evening of the 7 second pass Omega broke a couple of other records. Omega bested its previous 60–130mph time with a staggering 2.67 seconds. Omega also broke the 100–150mph record which was previously held by an Underground Racing TT Gallardo (2.58 seconds) with an astounding 2.45 seconds. The AMS Performance Alpha Omega package functions more as a shop/research and development vehicle which is the reason why it is not available to the general public. However, <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> purchase the Alpha 6, Alpha 9, Alpha 10, Alpha 12, Alpha 14 and Alpha 16 packages; each respectively with approximately 600, 900, 1000, 1200, 1,400 and 1,600 wheel horsepower when installed and tuned.|$|E

25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to all the little miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

She stated her main idea for the project was to [...] "evolve as an artist and a visionary", which was taken from a poem she wrote during The Stripped Tour (2003). In an interview with Billboard magazine, Aguilera expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary music, as technology [...] "has advanced itself so <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> be a singer". Thus, Aguilera took musical inspirations from old-school jazz, blues and soul records performed by her 1920s-1940s idols including Billie Holiday, Otis Redding, Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald, which she viewed as [...] "music that really had heart".|$|E

It is unclear why Lombardo has never received any writing credits in Slayer's history. Araya formed a lyric writing partnership with Hanneman, which sometimes overshadowed the creative input of King. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music was a [...] "free-for-all": [...] "It's all just whoever comes up with what.

[...] He then shifted to opposing the war: [...] "I no longer {{believe that it was}} necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia." [...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." [...] Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was [...] "morally right and necessary".|$|E

However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it.

500|$|When writing new material, {{the band}} writes the music before the lyrics.

The band will play the riff to get the basic song structure, and then {{figure out where the}} lyrics and solos go. Hanneman stated that writing lyrics and music is a [...] "free for all"; [...] "It's all just whoever comes up with what.

[...] Stipe told The New York Times the song was about romantic expression. He told Q that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] is about [...] "someone who pines for someone else. It's unrequited love, what have you." [...] Stipe compared the song's theme to [...] "Every Breath You Take" [...] by The Police, saying, [...] "It's just a classic obsession pop song.

500|$|On June 20, 2014, the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee {{learned that}} every one of the 470 senior {{executives}} in the VA received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least [...] "fully successful" [...] {{in each of the past}} four years. Congressional representatives argued that the data shows that senior management in the VA is out of touch with the problems in the department. Republican Representative Phil Roe said, [...] "Do you think that’s normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? That means you put the bar down here, so <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> step over it." [...] Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster compared the situation to grade inflation. Senior executives were paid a total of $2.4 million in bonus compensation in the most recent year. Gina S.

500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats.

[...] She characterized the Arbitration Committee decision as [...] "a routine internal action by Wikipedia to clean up its editing process".

But for the time being, her group's ability to do that have been weakened." [...] In a statement to CNN, Pouw asserted [...] "she is unaware of any coordinated effort to alter Wikipedia".|$|E
500|$|Shemanski {{petitioned the}} City Council {{to let him}} gift the fountain, which began {{operating}} on September 3, 1926. In 1987, the fountain's plumbing was repaired and a new base was poured {{as part of a}} renovation of the South Park Blocks. That same year, Logan and two other men—David L. Lipman and Jeff Wolfstone, grandson and great-grandson of Shemanski, respectively—approached the Portland Bureau of Parks and Recreation, advocating for the fountain's restoration. During the renovation process, the fountain was thoroughly cleaned, had missing pieces such as finials and urns replaced and chipped corners repaired, and was coated with a sealant to protect it from the elements and graffiti. In July 1988, the fountain re-opened following nearly a year of reconditioning. A dedication ceremony to mark the restoration was held on the afternoon of July 18. One park designer with the Park Bureau said, [...] "the water will be turned on {{for the first time that}} <b>anybody</b> <b>can</b> remember." [...] Lipman, Logan and Wolfstone attended the ceremony. Logan, aged 88, was the only surviving person who participated in the fountain's design and construction. The men offered funds for part of the renovation and the purchase of a bronze plaque that includes the original rendering done by Logan and describes the fountain's history and recent work. Costs for the plaque and renovation totaled $14,000.|$|E

Since retiring, he has taken on roles with various charities and other organisations focusing on Africa and Sierra Leone, including New Africa Analysis, the UK Association for Schools for the Blind, Sierra Leone (which supports the Sir Milton Margai School for the Blind in Freetown), and the Dorothy Springer Trust. He is considered a folk hero in Sierra Leone, and continues to speak on issues relating to Sierra Leone. He was vocal in his opposition to indictment of Samuel Hinga Norman—a pro-Kabbah militia leader during the civil war—for war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to the special court itself. He described the special court as an [...] "expensive and divisive piece of judicial machinery" [...] which served little purpose following the deaths of most of the prominent defendants, and believed that its continuation [...] "could undermine the fragile peace" [...] in Sierra Leone. Penfold was granted the Freedom of the City of Freetown and given the honorary title of Paramount Chief for his role in Sierra Leone, and has written a book about his experiences in the country, Atrocities, Diamonds and Diplomacy (...)
