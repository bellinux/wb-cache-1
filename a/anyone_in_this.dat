500|$|Ketèlbey's concert {{music was}} {{less well known}} in England than in {{continental}} Europe, where he conducted many programmes of his own works for the Concertgebouw Orchestra and others. The composer's more avowedly serious music was less widely esteemed by his compatriots. In a 1928 profile the magazine The British Musician commented, [...] "There {{is no need to}} explain here why his serious music, whether written thirty years ago or as recently as 1927... has not won the popularity of, say, Edward German's dances: it is pleasant music, delightfully scored; but it is not so fascinating as that from which it derives—the music of the Viennese writers of dance music, of Délibes and Gounod and the like." [...] The reviewer added, [...] "Albert Ketèlbey's works of the Monastery Garden type are by far the best that <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country has written, and they represent the end to which he was born." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{the first}} few months of {{founding}} JC's Girls, Veitch and Albee launched the organization's first official website, which initially received little traffic. Three months later, it had received 40,000 hits. By December 2005, the organization had received messages through its website from pornographic film actors and men with pornography addiction who said that JC's Girls had changed their lives. A slogan on the main page of the website read, [...] "If you are a CHRISTIAN ... See us in ACTION ...". Without asking for payment, Veitch's friend, pornographic film director James DiGiorgio, took glamour photographs of Veitch, Albee, and Huerter for the JC's Girls website. DiGiorgio was not a Christian, but said that he was helping these organizations in order to support their freedom of speech; he said that the sex industry is [...] "always trying to preach freedom of speech [...] <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> industry who has a problem with [...] message is a fucking hypocrite. You can't have it both ways." [...] Within a year of the organization's founding, Veitch, Albee, and Huerter were maintaining Myspace pages that they used to offer support, counsel, and advice. By 2008, the JC's Girls website, which included a blog, was receiving around 15,000 hits per day.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and it looks like {{he is going to be}} out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> league. They're committed, honest players who want to work for each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action for the rest of the 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing Witching Culture in , the American {{religious}} studies scholar James R. Lewis described {{the work as}} [...] "the best survey to date" [...] of modern Paganism, [...] "particularly if the focus of one's interest is North American Paganism". In his opinion, Witching Culture [...] "breaks important new ground in Pagan Studies. In fact, I anticipate that {{in the near future}} it will come to be regarded as a groundbreaking book—one to which all future studies of Paganism will refer." [...] He went on to describe it as [...] "my first choice for a textbook in any university class with a significant component on contemporary Paganism" [...] and felt that [...] "Almost every chapter contains either new insights or original analyses that extend prior discussions to a new depth." [...] Lewis noted that although he didn't have [...] "any real criticism" [...] of the book, he wished that it had discussed the role of solitary practitioners and teenage Wiccans, two significant sectors of the Pagan community whom Magliocco only mentioned in passing, and the infighting among the Wiccan community, which Magliocco hadn't even mentioned. Ultimately, Lewis remarked that [...] "I can heartily recommend this book as a 'must read' for <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> field, whether academic observers or reflective participants." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{this context}} {{collective}} intelligence is often confused with shared knowledge. The former {{is the sum}} total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community. Collective intelligence as represented by Web 2.0 has less user engagement than collaborative intelligence. An art project using Web 2.0 platforms is [...] "Shared Galaxy", an experiment developed by an anonymous artist to create a collective identity that shows up as one person on several platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and Second Life. The password is written in the profiles and the accounts named [...] "Shared Galaxy" [...] are open to be used by <b>anyone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> way many take part in being one. Another art project using collective intelligence to produce artistic work is Curatron, where a large group of artists together decides on a smaller group that they think would make a good collaborative group. The process is used based on an algorithm computing the collective preferences In creating what he calls 'CI-Art', Nova Scotia based artist Mathew Aldred follows Pierry Lévy's definition of collective intelligence. [...] Aldred's CI-Art event in March 2016 involved over four hundred people from the community of Oxford, Nova Scotia, and internationally. Later work developed by Aldred used the UNU swarm intelligence system to create digital drawings and paintings. [...] The Oxford Riverside Gallery (Nova Scotia) held a public CI-Art event in May 2016, which connected with online participants internationally.|$|E
