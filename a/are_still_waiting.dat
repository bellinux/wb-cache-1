25|$|GEDCO {{estimates}} {{the damage to}} the electricity network due to the recent hostilities at over $10 million. Even before the conflict, its reserves of spare parts were close to depletion due to the 18-month blockade on Gaza. By 29 January 38 transformers essential for the repair of the electricity system <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> permission from the Israelis to be allowed into Gaza. Due to the lack of supplies, GEDCO continues to partially repair the network where possible. The UN warns that those ad-hoc partial repairs will increase technical losses by 25-30 percent, reduce the lifetime of network components, and further expose sections of the network to possible collapse. Since the cease-fire, Israel has allowed approximately 87 tonnes cooking gas per day, which is much less than the estimated need of 300 tonnes per day. No petrol or diesel has been allowed into Gaza since 2 November, except for UNRWA. No petrol, diesel or cooking gas was allowed by Israel into Gaza between 8 and 14 February.|$|E
25|$|Lisa {{protests that}} the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this {{statement}} and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. He tosses the plant {{into the air and}} it lands {{in the hands of a}} Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has sneaked on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for Homer to go through the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.|$|E

[...] Though documentary evidence of an actual meeting of Dyer and Fox is lacking, it is certain that Dyer was known to Margaret Fell, based on a letter written to Margaret by two Quakers in Barbadoes. [...] The two men, John Rous and Henry Fell (no close relation to Thomas and Margaret Fell) [...] wrote on 24 May 1657 that [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> here to get a passage for New England.

500|$|On {{the last}} day of summer vacation, Lisa brings the family to the museum to see a weaving exhibit as her summer activity, but they quickly {{discover}} that it has been canceled and replaced by a [...] "History of Weapons" [...] exhibit. Faced with an incredibly long line, Homer notices Ned Flanders and his children {{at the front of the}} line and cuts in front of them. Others start taking advantage of Ned’s kindness as well, until the Flanders family is stuck at the end. At the end of the day, they <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting,</b> and are denied entry, as it is closing time for the weapons exhibit. They therefore decide to check out the evolution exhibit next door. Ned is horrified to hear that humans evolved from apes and that the creation account in the Genesis is characterized as a myth. Covering his children's eyes, he drags them out of the exhibit.|$|E
500|$|On the Kahana, Desmond and Sayid <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> {{to speak}} to the captain of the freighter, Gault (Grant Bowler). When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps {{off the side of the}} ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that [...] Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to make everybody believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying that is one of the reasons why Mr. Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus [...] and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) working as a deckhand under the alias [...] "Kevin Johnson".|$|E

They locate the fourth Star Piece on Star Hill and learn that Mallow's real parents <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for him to return. The five travel to Seaside Town, where the residents inform them that a Star Piece has fallen in the sunken ship in the lake that is owned by the Jonathan Johnny Jones, a shark pirate. After defeating a giant blooper named King Calamari (who was responsible for sinking the ship) and challenging Jones and his crew to a fight, they win the fifth Star Piece. Returning to Seaside Town, they discover that the townsfolk are actually Yaridovich (another member of the Smithy Gang) in disguise. He threatens the real townsfolk in order to force Mario to hand over the Star Piece. He tries to escape with it but is unable to when his ride doesn't arrive. Jones prevents Yaridovich's escape and Mario and friends defeat him and recover the Star Piece (as well as freeing the real townsfolk). After recovering six of the Star Pieces, Mario's group learns that the final piece is held by Smithy in Bowser's castle. Upon battling their way through the assembled enemies and fighting Exor, they discover that he is actually a gateway to Smithy's factory, where Smithy mass-produces his army. After defeating Exor, he inhales them, sending them to the factory.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 June 2011, Williams {{said that}} the British Government was {{committing}} Britain to [...] "radical, long-term policies for which no-one voted". Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Williams raised concerns about the coalition's health, education and welfare reforms. He said there was [...] "indignation" [...] {{due to a lack}} of [...] "proper public argument". He also {{said that the}} [...] "Big Society" [...] idea was viewed with [...] "widespread suspicion", noting also that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for a full and robust account of what the Left would do differently and what a Left-inspired version of localism would look like". The article also said there was concern that the government would abandon its responsibility for tackling child poverty, illiteracy and poor access to the best schools. He also expressed concern about the [...] "quiet resurgence of the seductive language of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor" [...] and the steady pressure to increase [...] "what look like punitive responses to alleged abuses of the system". In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am absolutely convinced that our policies are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means let us have a robust debate but I can tell you, it will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E
