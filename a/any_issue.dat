5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce <b>any</b> <b>issue,</b> though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. <b>Any</b> <b>issue</b> that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the public}} take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster: a public petitioning system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the {{interested}} public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs.

5|$|The storyline {{was also}} criticized by GameBrink.Com for feeling {{secondary}} to the gameplay yet being told in long and numerous cut scenes; their amount was {{compared to that of}} the Xenosaga series.

5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia {{can be called}} by the Parliament or the President on <b>any</b> <b>issue</b> falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E
