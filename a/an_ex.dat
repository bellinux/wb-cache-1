Whilst some saw this transfer as a 'banishment' from the central government to the hinterlands to keep Bo's perceived arrogance and high-profile antics out of Beijing's view, others considered it a promotion since being the party chief in one of the four direct-controlled municipalities came with <b>an</b> <b>ex</b> officio seat on the Politburo.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender. In October 1945, {{after the end of the}} war, the Sammarinese government submitted a claim for 732 million lira to the British government for wartime compensation, of which 500 million lira were given as the related costs of the fighting in September and 20 million lira as the costs of the occupation. The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as Germany had breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer <b>an</b> <b>ex</b> gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{decision}} of the inquiry went against NESCo and those in support of the station, and the company dropped their plans. NESCo received <b>an</b> <b>ex</b> gratia payment of £6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.|$|E

It has a total capacity for up to 35 members and currently includes 4 officers, 18 community representatives, and 5 university representatives. The board of directors is composed of the university president who acts as <b>an</b> <b>ex</b> officio voting director and who appoints one ex officio executive director, one faculty member, one student member, and either the vice president for administrative affairs or the chief financial officer.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that high factor VIII (FVIII) levels in thrombosis patients is principally explained by {{a gain of}} function in the FVIII-binding domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF), arising from amino acid substitution(s) or polymorphism(s), was investigated.
