Mild rhinitis and tracheitis were found in most animals and <b>acute</b> purulent <b>bronchopneumonia</b> in two animals, which may have resulted from spontaneous subclinical Bordetella bronchiseptica infection. Viral and bacterial respiratory diseases of the guineapig are briefly reviewed. Keywords Guineapigs; pneumonia virus of mice; Bordetella bronchiseptica Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus that is mor-phologically similar to bovine and human respiratory syncytial viruses which constitute the only known members of the genus Pneumovirus of Paramyxoviridae family of viruses (Parker & Richer 1982). Serum anti-bodies to PVM have been detected in guineapigs for over 20 years, but the clinical significance and lesions associated with PVM infection of guineapigs have not been deter-mined (Van Hoosier & Robinette 1976, Percy & Barthold 1993).

40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological findings in a fatal case of farmer's lung in a 17 -year-old youth are described. His lungs were uncomplicated by chronic disease, {{and his first}} exposure to mouldy hay probably occurred only weeks before his death. As this was an acute attack, whose duration could be measured in days, the changes seen are probably the earliest to be recorded, and the probable nature of the sensitivity reaction can be deduced. The pathological process is seen to be an <b>acute</b> centrilobular <b>bronchopneumonia</b> of a special type and is associated with an obstructive bronchio-litis. There is a focal interstitial pneumonia with much proliferation of alveolar epithelium, {{and there is a}} necrotic exudate in which neutrophils and eosinophils are seen along with mononuclears, some lymphocytes, and plasma cells. The alveolar spaces are in many cases obscured, but others contain a haemorrhagic fluid. Alveolar capillaries show an acute vasculitis, with platelet and fibrin deposition, and with acute neutrophil infiltration. Serological and mycological data are included. Precipitins to mouldy hay and to Thermopolyspora polyspora were found in the serum. In dusts collected from his habitat T. polyspora was found.

40|$|Abstruct. Tracheobronchial aspirates were {{obtained}} from 27 normal horses and from 57 horses with respiratory disease. Aspirates from normal horses contained mainly ciliated columnar epithelial cells, mononuclear cells, a few neutrophils and mucus. Aspirates from horses with <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>bronchopneumonias</b> or chronic bronchiolitis had predomi-nantly neutrophils and usually large amounts of mucus; in severe suppurative inflammatory diseases, many of the cells were degenerated, and there were coils of fibrinous material resembling Curschmann’s spirals. Eosinophils were rarely found, even from horses with histories suggestive of allergic respiratory disease. Aspirates from horses with epistaxis frequently had macrophages with intracytoplasmic green globules (hemosiderin). Tracheo-bronchial aspirates occasionally revealed subclinical lung disease. Four horses with no clinical signs of lung disease and lungs that were unremarkable on percussion and normal on auscultation had aspirates suggestive of inflammation; histologic examination con-firmed bronchiolitis. Tracheobronchial aspirates are frequently used in diagnosis of pulmonary disease, especially neoplasia in man. Unlike man the horse rarely develops neoplasms of the respiratory tract, but aspirates are useful for understand-ing the type of reaction occurring in the airways and lung; they can also reveal subclinical pulmonary disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Granzymes are a {{sub-family}} of serine proteases {{involved in}} the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders. In contrast to granzyme A and B, the role of granzyme K (GrK) in human lung diseases is unknown. Therefore, we investigated the release and expression of GrK in allergic asthma, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and bronchopneumonia. METHODS: Soluble GrK was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with allergic asthma (before and after segmental allergen challenge), and patients with mild COPD, pneumonia, and healthy controls. The molecular form of GrK was analyzed by Western blot. Flow-cytometry was performed to determine the cellular expression of GrK. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, there were normal levels of soluble GrK in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with COPD, and patients with allergic asthma before allergen challenge. In contrast, soluble GrK was strongly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> In patients with allergic asthma, there was...|$|E
40|$|Dose {{dependent}} pulmonary lesions of <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia</b> were induced in male, outbred Swiss Webster mice by intrabronchial inoculation of Pasteurella haemolytica. Five exponential dilutions {{ranging from}} 5 x 10 (4) to 5 x 10 (8) {{colony forming units}} per mL (CFU/mL) of Pasteurella haemolytica serotype 1 were inoculated into five groups of mice.

40|$|Zoo animals, {{including}} tigers, {{have been}} reported to suffer from barbiturate intoxication, with pentabarbitone being most commonly recorded. Clinical signs range from mild ataxia to general anaesthesia with recovery over hours to days with several factors affecting hepatic barbiturate metabolism and tissue partitioning. Botulism is an often fatal intoxication in man, animals, birds and certain fish. The occurrence in carnivores is uncommon to rare, with only 2 reports found of botulism in felids. This report relates to 3 adult captive cohabiting tigers that simultaneously developed signs of abdominal discomfort, progressive ataxia, recumbency and comatose sleep resembling stage 2 anaesthesia, alternating with periods of distracted wakefulness and ataxic movements. These signs occurred 4 days after being fed the carcass of a horse that had ostensibly died of colic and not been euthanased. The male tiger that was the dominant animal in the feeding hierarchy was worst affected and had to be given intravenous fluids. The female that was lowest in hierarchy was unaffected. After 48 - 72 hours of treatment at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital the females could eat and made an uneventful recovery. The male tiger showed partial recovery but died during the night a few hours after drinking water on his return to the owner. Necropsy revealed severe oesophageal dilation and impaction with decaying grass; some of this material and water were present in the pharynx and trachea, and had been aspirated causing <b>acute</b> widespread <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> Colon content tested negative for common pesticides but, together with liver, tested positive for barbiturate. Serum taken on the day of admission had tested negative for barbiturate and the residual serum from the 3 animals later tested negative for botulinum toxin. Colon and oesophageal content from the male at necropsy were positive for Clostridium botulinum toxin type C by the mouse bioassay neutralisation test, confirming that this male had had concomitant barbiturate toxicity and botulism, and had succumbed to aspiration bronchopneumonia secondary to pharyngeal, laryngeal and oesophageal paralysis and oesophageal impaction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some studies of human and animal lungs that the products of pulmonary endocrine cells, particularly gastrin-releasing pep-tide, might {{play a role in}} fibrogenesis, but more recent detailed studies of fibro-tic human lungs have failed to confirm this. We have made a detailed quantitative examination of a series of fibrotic human lungs {{to see if we could}} determine whether there was any relationship between endocrine cells and fibrosis. Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the morphology, content, distrib-ution and number of pulmonary endocrine cells in 15 pairs of fibrotic lungs from coal miners, and compared their features with those of equivalent cells in age-matched controls. Proliferation of endocrine cells was seen in the lungs of just two miners, in which it was focal and associated with <b>acute</b> bronchitis and <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> There was no difference between the miners and controls in the appearance (mostly soli-tary cells), content (predominantly gastrin-releasing peptide and calcitonin), dis-tribution (mainly in small bronchi and bronchioles), or number (4. 5 vs 4. 1 cells per 10, 000 epithelial cells, respectively) of endocrine cells. It seems unlikely that the substances secreted by these cells play any role in stimulating fibrosis in human lungs, but rather that they have a function in the inflammatory response to pulmonary injury...|$|R
40|$|Anionic Peptide (AP) {{is a small}} zymogen {{fragment}} {{that has}} antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, {{as well as other}} microbes. AP was Originally isolated from pulmonary surfactant from sheep and was later identified in lung tissue of sheep and humans. In this dissertation, we tested the hypothesis that AP production is constitutive in epithelial cells of all ages (fetal to adult) of domestic ruminants (sheep and cattle);Chapter 1 consists of a literature review of the recently described antimicrobial peptides including cationic peptides such as alpha and beta-defensins, cathelicidins, and Anionic Peptide. Chapter 2 reports the presence of AP in bovine lung tissue, as detected by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. In this study, we also determined that AP production is not increased in foci of acute (four hours duration) pneumonia. In Chapter 3, we also assessed the pattern of AP production in fetal, neonatal, and adult respiratory tissues. Fetal respiratory epithelium (tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar) was much more intensely immunoreactive than tissues from neonatal and adult cattle. In addition, in Chapter 3 we surveyed non-pulmonary, non-inflamed mucosal sites in the bovine for AP production. AP is produced in the inner root sheath epithelium of the hair follicle, epithelium of the gall bladder, and uterine endometrium. AP is not produced in stratified squamous epithelium (skin, cheek, tongue, esophagus), gastrointestinal epithelium, or transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder. Thus, AP is not produced at all sites of interface between the body and microbial flora. In Chapter 4, AP production was compared between acute, subacute, and chronic lesions of pneumonic pasteurellosis in sheep. As described previously, there is no increase in AP production in foci of <b>acute,</b> suppurative <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> However, in subacute and chronic lesions that have bronchiolar hyperplasia, there is moderate to marked increases in AP production in the hyperplastic epithelium;In this dissertation, we have shown that AP is produced in the bovine respiratory tract and is at maximal production (or concentration) in immature or hyperplastic epithelium. Furthermore, we have shown that increased AP production is independent of damage to a mature epithelial cell, and likely constitutive...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of a portable blood lactate analyser for bovine blood and to study the relevance of plasma lactate concentration in the prognosis of bovine pulmonary disorders. Measurements with the portable analyser were highly correlated (R = 0. 94, P< 0. 0001) with the measurements of the reference method but significantly different (P< 0. 0001). The portable apparatus slightly overestimated plasma lactate concentration compared to the reference method (bias = + 0. 412). Plasma lactate measurements on 109 calves suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia</b> showed increasing lactate concentrations with severity of the disease. A plasma lactate concentration higher than 3. 6 mmol/L or 4 mmol/L, measured with the reference method and the portable analyser respectively, appeared to be a reliable prognostic indicator for mortality within 24 h. Consequently, this measurement could be very helpful to decrease economic losses in cases of bovine respiratory disease, by avoiding unnecessary treatment costs on cattle with poor prognosis.

40|$|Infants with mandibular {{hypoplasia}} {{are at risk}} {{of sudden}} death from cardiorespiratory arrest secondary to upper airway obstruction. To evaluate diagnostic difficulties that may occur at autopsy in such infants, the autopsy files at the Adelaide Children's Hospital (ACH) for 36 years, 1959 to 1994, were reviewed. Eight cases were identified (age range, 2 days to 10 months; mean age, 2. 2 months; male/female ratio, 5 : 3). In all cases, death was considered most likely due to airway obstruction related to mandibular hypoplasia or its treatment. Although death occurred in the hospital in five cases, one infant suddenly collapsed at home while feeding and died, and two infants were unexpectedly found dead in their cribs at home. Three infants had defined genetic syndromes. Although all the infants had histories of antemortem airway obstruction, one infant had normal oxygen saturation studies before hospital discharge, and one infant had a tracheostomy. <b>Acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia</b> was an exacerbating factor in one case. Assessment of mandibular size is important in any infant who dies unexpectedly; and if hypoplasia is found, careful review of the clinical details for evidence of airway obstruction is necessary to help distinguish these cases from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Sudden death may, however, occur in infants with mandibular hypoplasia in spite of apparent clinical stability before death with no significant recent episodes of oxygen desaturation...|$|E

At the age of 20 months he visited our hospital because of unsteady gait. On first examination we found mild telangiectasia in the conjunctivae of his eyes. At about seven years of age, he began to troubled by choreoathetosis and extensive and vigorous involuntary movement of his trunk. These became progressively worse untill about 20 years of age.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} compare the treatment regimens in feedlot cattle that died with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) to the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms isolated from lungs. Forty-three cattle submitted by the Willard Sparks Beef Research Center (WSBRC) to the Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for postmortem examination during 2007 had <b>bronchopneumonia</b> (<b>acute</b> = 16, subacute = 5, or chronic = 22). Lungs from cattle were cultured aerobically (40 cattle) and for Mycoplasma spp. (34 cattle). Susceptibility panels were performed. At least 1 BRD pathogen (Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, Mycoplasma bovis, or Arcanobacterium pyogenes) was isolated from 39 cattle, and 77 % (30 / 39) had multiple organisms recovered. Mycoplasmal infections were common (25 / 34) and {{a major component of}} mixed infections (24 / 25). The majority (60 %) of the M. haemolytica, P. multocida, and H. somni isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Most of the H. somni isolates (67 %) were susceptible to tilmicosin (Ti), enrofloxacin (En), ceftiofur (Ce), and florfenicol, despite extensive treatment with Ti, En, and Ce (75 % of isolates were from cattle that received each antimicrobial once). Most of the M. haemolytica (65 %) and P. multocida (79 %) isolates were susceptible to En and Ce, despite antemortem treatment of cattle with these antimicrobials. Hence, the current study reports a discrepancy between the antemortem treatment of clinical BRD and the susceptibility patterns of the bacteria isolated from lungs postmortem.

40|$|Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is a pattern-recognition {{molecule}} of {{the innate}} immune system that recognizes various microbial surface-specific carbohydrate and lipid patterns. In vitro data has suggested that this binding may lead to increased microbial association with macrophages and dendritic cells. The aim of the present in vivo study was to study the expression of porcine SP-D (pSP-D) in the lung during different pulmonary bacterial infections, {{and the effect of}} the routes of infection on this expression was elucidated. Furthermore, the aim was to study the in vivo spatial relationship among pSP-D, pathogens, phagocytic cells and dendritic cells. Lung tissue was collected from experimental and natural bronchopneumonias caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, and from embolic and diffuse interstitial pneumonia, caused by Staph. aureus or Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Streptococcus suis serotype 2, respectively. By comparing normal and diseased lung tissue from the same lungs, increased diffuse pSP-D immunoreactivity was seen in the surfactant in both <b>acute</b> and chronic <b>bronchopneumonias,</b> while such increased expression of pSP-D was generally not present in the interstitial pneumonias. Co-localization of pSP-D, alveolar macrophages and bacteria was demonstrated, and pSP-D showed a patchy distribution on the membranes of alveolar macrophages. SP-D immunoreactivity was intracellular in dendritic cells. The dendritic cells were identified by their morphology, the absence of macrophage marker immunoreactivity and the presence of dendritic cell marker immunoreactivity. Increased expression of pSP-D in the surfactant coincided with presence of pSP-D-positive dendritic cells in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), indicating a possible transport of pSP-D through the specialized M cells overlying (BALT). In conclusion, we have shown that pSP-D expression in the lung surfactant is induced by bacterial infection by an aerogenous route rather than by a haematogenous route, and that the protein interacts specifically with alveolar macrophages and with dendritic cells in microbial-induced BALT. The function of the interaction between pSP-D and dendritic cells in BALT remain unclear, but pSP-D could represent a link between the innate and adaptive immune system, facilitating the bacterial antigen presentation by dendritic cells in BALT...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} an sonographic {{examination}} {{of the heart and}} the carotid artery was performed on 33 resting horses.

The echocardiography contained standard image planes with the B-mode, measurement of the fractional shortening (FS%) with the M-mode and investigations with the doppler technique. On this occasion the closing ability of the heartvalves was examined with the colour flow doppler and blood flow profiles were established with the pulsed wave doppler in 5 locations: in the right ventricular outflow tract, in the level of the pulmonal valve, in the pulmonary artery, in the aortic artery and in the carotid artery. The aim of the study was the determination of blood flow parameters which indicate the development of a cor pulmonale in a horse with respiratory problems. The clinical investigation of the ill horses exhibited a set of significantly changed diagnosis of the respiration tract and an increase of the heart frequency. The echocardiography of the resting patients showed an obvious high demand on the heart and signs of the circulatory disturbance of the lung. The right caudal long axis view in the B-mode showed a clear volume overload of the right part of the heart recognizable from the dilated chambers, the downward curved interventricularseptum and sometimes a hypertrophy of the heart walls. For the first time a delayed closing point of the mitral valve up to the S-point of the electrocardiogram has been demonstrated with horses with a clear marked dyspnoea. In the carotid artery a changed sequence of the blood flow waves was found caused by the intensified respiration. At the valves of the right heart a significant increase of flow backs was detected and the diameter of the pulmonary artery was significantly enlarged. The pulsed wave doppler investigation identified a number of partly obvious changed blood flow parameters for example the systolic time intervals (EMS, ET, PEP), the blood flow volume and the flow velocities (SPV, EDV, DPV) in horses with a respiratory disease. Here the influence of the regulation on the heart and circulation has to be considered. This is individual according to the state of illness and the changing, for example, of the perfusion of the lung and the partial pressure of the air in the arterial blood. The diagnosis of a cor pulmonale with the functional blood flow parameters is not possible because they dont cover the typical morphologic changes of the heart. The cor pulmonale can be impressively presented with the B-mode technique which shows the rounded heart form and the measurement of the heart chamber diameter. The insufficiencies of the heart valves are diagnosed with auscultation and colour flow doppler investigations. The clear changes in the demand on the heart of horses with respiratory failure reported in this study lead to the conclusion that a echocardiographic examination is absolutely advisable. This {{is the only way to}} estimate the exercise tolerance of a horse with respiratory disease and taking animal rights into consideration. The recorded findings have a crucial importance for the further use and the future destiny of an inflicted horse...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of {{selective}} IgM deficiency not associated with malig- nancies or autoimmune disorders. A 26 -yr-old male was admitted because of <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> Cefmetazole was effective for the disease. He, however, seemed to have an impaired immunity against infections. Six and 3 months before this admission, he had been hospitalized with acute pleuritis. In addition, he had more histories of recurrent infections; 3 hospitalizations for pneumonia at 16, 20 and 21 years of age, twice for pyelonephritis at 17 and 27 {{years of age and}} once for acute sinusitis at 8 years of age. Laboratory findings revealed a very low level of serum IgM, 10 mg/dl, while serum IgG and IgA were within normal limits, 805 mg/dl and 239 mg/dl, respectively. Interestingly serum IgD was elevated as high as 102 mg/dl. On microfluorometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), the number of B lymphocytes bearing pan-B markers such as CD 19, CD 20 and CD 21 was decreased, while that of CD 4 ⁺ or CD 8 ⁺ T cells and the CD 4 /CD 8 ratio was normal. As for the number of B lymphocytes bearing surface immunoglobulin (sIg), the number of sIgM⁺ B lymphocytes was decreased. Responses of PBLs to both phytohemoagglutinin and concanavalin A were normal, but those to pokeweed mitogen and staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I seemed to be suppressed. In the present report, we also discuss the cases of primary selective IgM deficiency documented in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Objectives of this {{investigation}} were (a) to characterize a naturally occurring plant-particle pneumonia in swine and (b) to reproduce the disease in experimental pigs using soybean particle suspensions;The incidence and lung histopathology of natural plant-particle pneumonia were determined by examination of lung tissues from 62 confinement-reared, self-fed pigs; 26 confinement-reared, floor-fed pigs; and 444 pig necropsies accessioned during a 5 year period;Characteristics of experimental soybean-induced plant-particle pneumonia were determined by clinical observations and gross, histological, ultrastructural and microbiological examinations of the respiratory tract. Ninety-three pigs given soybean particles transtracheally and 36 control pigs were studied;In the naturally occurring disease, plant particles were associated with granulomatous lung lesions in 25 of 62 self-fed pigs. Particles morphologically consistent with soybean were found in 7 of the 25 pigs. Six of 9 pigs among 444 pigs examined retrospectively had soybean particles in granulomatous lung lesions. Microscopically, lesions in affected pigs from both groups consisted of neutrophils admixed with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in alveolar and bronchiolar exudate. Plant particles 20 to 100 (mu) m were free in alveoli, in phagocytes, and in granulomas;Experimentally induced plant-particle pneumonia was characterized clinically by coughing and dyspnea. At necropsy, there was gross bullous emphysema, lung hemorrhage, and yellow to gray lung mottling. Microscopically, there was a sequential transition from <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia</b> to granulomatous pneumonia. Ultrastructurally, there were interstitial foreign body granulomas which formed when multinucleated giant cells became entrapped by connective tissue after alveolar epithelium was destroyed. When pigs were given multiple doses of soybean, lesions were simultaneously suppurative and granulomatous, similar to those seen in the natural disease...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{immunodeficiency}} disorders pose {{a diagnostic}} dilemma for physicians {{in the developing}} countries such as Pakistan {{because of lack of}} adequate diagnostic facilities. We present here the case of a 17 -year-old girl who had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections since childhood and had been treated with anti-tuberculous medications thrice, for a total of 24 months. She had also received multiple courses of antibiotics. Her initial presentation to our hospital was with <b>acute</b> <b>bronchopneumonia.</b> Her past medical history of recurrent infections also alerted the treating physician to the possibility of bronchiectasis secondary to a variety of underlying potential pathologies such as post-infection, immunodeficiency syndromes or ciliary dyskinesia disorders. Cystic fibrosis was also an important consideration. Direct enquiry revealed that there was no history of consanguineous marriage in her parents. Her sweat chloride test was within normal range (/L). Blood analysis was performed which showed IgA, IgG 2 and IgG 4 deficiency. She has been following up at our hospital for the past few years. In that course of time, she has had multiple episodes of pneumonia, gastroenteritis and maxillary sinusitis. She was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulins on four occasions when she presented with systemic crisis secondary to severe systemic infection. She also developed biopsy proven intermediate grade non-Hodgkin 2 ̆ 7 s lymphoma five years after the diagnosis of immunoglobulin deficiency was first made. This appeared to be a complication of her immunodeficient state. She has been receiving chemotherapy for the lymphoma. Physicians should be cognizant of the morbidity that primary immunodeficiency syndromes such as immunoglobulin deficiency can have in the form of multiple infections and increased risk of malignancies as seen in our Patient...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in khartoum slaughterhouses (El Sabaloga and El Kadarou), during the period 2002 - 2003 to investigate the condemnation causes of cattle and sheep lungs and associated lymph nodes. Three hundred animals (117 cattle and 183 sheep) were examined postmortem. Various causes of lung condemnations were recorded and compared with condemnation data collected from slaughterhouses records during the period 1998 - 2002. the results of the survey showed that specific and non-specific lung affections are high among slaughtered sheep and cattle and this matches well with the condemnation records of slaughterhouses in khartoum State. This indicates that pulmonary diseases may be prevalent in meat animals and should receive adequate attention. The condemnation records showed that out of 1717831 slaughtered sheep 15. 47 % were found to have pulmonary involvement. The main causes of lung condemnation record were: pneumonia (51. 95 %), aspirated blood (29. 42 %), congestion (9. 53 %), adhesion (5. 59 %) and abscess (3. 27 %). One case of tuberculosis was observed. The condemnations were high in March, September and October and low in june, August and November. On the other hand, out of 955336 cattle slaughtered 6. 47 % had lung affections. The lung condemnations were due to pneumonia(47. 79 %), adhesions (0. 99 %), congestion (1. 24 %), aspirated blood(49. 75 %) and abscesses (0. 15 %). Hydatid cysts were seen in (0. 08 %) of the condemned lungs and four cases (0. 01 %) showed typical lesions of tuberculosis. Condemnations due to pneumonia were high in September and low in February. Grossly the types of pneumonia observed were mainly <b>bronchopneumonia</b> (<b>acute,</b> suppurative and fibrinous) and interstitial pneumonia. These were confirmed histopathologically. Sections of four of the caseated nodules in cattle showed typical granulomatous lesions of tuberculosis, though no acid fast organisms were seen in sections stained with Ziehl Neelsen stain. However, impression smears from lymph nodes showed one positive case of acid fast bacilli. H&E sections from lungs with severe congestion or haemorrhage exhibited haemosidrin laden machrophages in association with chronic bronchitis, interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis. Perl’s prussian blue reaction was positive for iron. Other special stains were used in this study to verify and confirm various lesions and {{this was one of the}} main aims of this study. Vonkossa’s stain was used to confirm presence of calcium deposits. Collagen fibers (in cases of lung fibrosis) were with Van Gieson’s stain and with Masson’s trichrome stain. Verhoeff’s stain was utilized to demonstrate elastic fibers and Gordon and sweets stain was used to confirm presence of reticulin fibers...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Multiple myeloma (MM) is {{characterized}} by the presence of neoplastic proliferating plasma cells. The tumor is generally restricted to the bone marrow. The most common complications include renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, anemia and reccurent infections. The spectrum of MM neurological complications is diverse, however, involvement of MM in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and leptomeningeal infiltration are rare considered. In about 1 % of the cases, the disease affects the central nervous system (CNS) and presents itself in the form of localized intraparenchymal lesions, solitary cerebral plasmocytoma or CNS myelomatosis (LMM). Case report. We presented the clinical course of a 55 -year-old man with MM and LMM proven by malignant plasma cells in the CSF, hospitalized with the pain in the thoracic spine. His medical history was uneventful. There had been no evidence of mental or neurological impairment prior to the seizures. Physical examination showed no abnormalities. After a complete staging, the diagnosis of MM type biclonal gammopathia IgG lambda and free lambda light chains in the stage III was confirmed. The treatment started with systemic chemotherapy (with vincristine, doxorubicin plus high-dose dexamethasone - VAD protocol), radiotherapy and bisphosphonate. The patient developed weakness, nausea, febrility, dispnea, bilateral <b>bronchopneumonia,</b> <b>acute</b> renal insufficiency, confusions, headaches and soon thereafter sensomotor aphasias and right hemiparesis. The patient was treated with the adequate therapy including one hemodyalisis. His neurological status was deteriorated, so Multislice Computed Tomography (MSCT) of the head was performed and the findings were normal. Analysis of CSF showed pleocytosis, 26 elements/ mL and increased concentrations of proteins. Cytological analysis revealed an increased number of plasma cells (29 %). Electrophoretic analysis of proteins disclosed the existance of monoclonal components in the serum, urine and CSF. Immunofixation electrophoretic and quantitative nephelometric tests confirmed Biclonal multiple myeloma of IgG lambda and light chain lambda isotypes. Analysis of neurothropic viruses with ELISA methods was negative. Once the presence of LMM was confirmed, the patient received intrathecal chemotherapy with methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, dexamethasone three times a week, and systemic high doses of dexamethasone iv like a single agent without craniospinale irradiations. Despite the treatment, the patient died one month after the diagnosis. Autopsy was not performed. Conclusion. Presented patient, as well as most other patients with MM progressing to CNS infiltration was in the stage III. In addition to the detailed clinical examination, and all investigations required for MM diagnosis and staging of the disease, we introduced the additional CSF examination and calculation of kappa lambda ratio, that helped us make an early diagnosis and prognosis of MM with LMM. Although LMM had a low prevalence, it could be more frequent than expected especially in patients with high risk. CSF examination with positive plasma cells and abnormal morphology remains the hallmark for diagnosing CNS infiltration...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} 14 th century the Medici, {{one of the}} most {{powerful}} and influential families of the Renaissance, achieved their fortune through banking and commerce. They gained prominent position in the political life of the city of Florence, which became the cultural centre of Europe. Lovers of the arts, the Medici were patrons of Michelangelo, Leonardo, Botticelli, Galileo and Benvenuto Cellini. Almost all the most prominent members of the Medici were buried under the vaults of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence (Sommi Picenardi 1888). In 2002, the Superintendent of Florence Antonio Paolucci authorized examination of 49 of the Medici corpses buried in the church. This was a unique opportunity to study the health conditions, lifestyles and causes of death of some of the most important members of this family. There are two main branches in the genealogical tree of the Medici family, which ruled Florence and Tuscany in the golden years of Renaissance: that of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1446 - 1492), and that of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, from John of the Black Bands (1498 - 1526) to the last Grand Duke Gian Gastone (1671 - 1737). The “Medici Project” intends to study the latter, which is the less investigated series. Aim of the “Medici Project”, coordinated by the University of Pisa, the University of Florence and the Superintendence of the Florentine Museums, is to perform an archaeological and paleopathological research on 49 of the funerary depositions in the Chapels. The research will include funerary archaeology, anthropology, paleonutrition, parasitology, pathology, histology, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, molecular biology and identification of ancient pathogens. The most recent biomedical techniques will be used to obtain as much information as possible about these important figures (Fornaciari et al. 2005, 2006). In order to study the bodies, we set up a temporary laboratory in the “Lorena Chapel”, the funerary crypt of the Grand Dukes of the Lorena Dynasty, which ruled over Florence and Tuscany after the Medici, until 1859. Following the exploration of some burials during the second World War, we first decided to examine the tomb of Gian Gastone, the last Grand Duke of the Medici (1671 - 1737). A dark marble disk with no epigraph, considered a simple floor decoration was removed, displaying a secret opening, with a small stone stair leading to a totally unknown hidden crypt. The small funerary crypt revealed a sort of raised floor level surrounding a room which hosted a large sarcophagus, and many small wooden coffins, completely collapsed on the floor, and covered by a layer of dry mould, as a result of the 1966 flooding. Dampness (90 %) and temperature (30 °C) were so high that specific equipment was necessary to control climatization at the entrance of the crypt. This climatization eliminated the danger of damage to the coffins and bodies, by the introduction of external air during the works of archaeologists. A number of funerary depositions were unexpectedly well preserved as for example the burial of a 5 -year-old child with dress, shoes and silver crown. The dress was formed by a red silk jacket with thin collar and buttons, in a flowery pattern with silver gallons, and large plus-fours of the same tissue. The external wooden sarcophagus of the Grand Duke Gian Gastone with a badly damaged lid collapsed in its interior contained another sarcophagus in lead, with a large Christian cross and six iron handles on the lid. The funerary deposition of the Grand Duke was intact: he was still wearing his funerary crown in gold-covered copper and was covered by the silk Great Cape (Cappa Magna) of Grand Master of Knights of the Order of St Stephen. Two large golden medallions, about 110 grams each, appeared at the sides of the Grand Duke’s head as well as a silver crucifix on the chest and a large lead tube, probably containing a parchment with some writings celebrating the Grand Duke. The study of the skeleton of Cosimo I (1519 - 1574), 1 st Grand Duke of Tuscany, revealed that he was a vigorous man, with anthropological age of 50 - 60 years, 1. 78 m tall, medium-sized skull and a narrow nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The muscular insertions were those of a very strong man (Robb 1994). The horseman markers were all present, showing the ergonomic pattern of a perfect knight (Belcastro et al. 2001). During adolescence, reveals that, during adolescence, Cosimo must have carried very heavy loads on his thorax, probably the armours of that period, as attested by the presence of some Schmorl vertebral hernias (Weiss 2005). The clinical history of Cosimo I is evidenced by the very rich archive data, including the reports of the ambassadors and court physicians. Apart from some well recovered diseases, such as smallpox, malarial fevers, gravel and bronchitis, we have a picture of severe early arteriosclerosis, with paralysis of the left arm, right hemi paresis, dyslalia, psychical instability, urinary incontinence, aphasia and agraphia. There is an acute articular disease, a sort of arthritis, named “gout” of the right knee, or generic “gout”. Finally, death was caused by catarrhal fever, probably bronchopneumonia, at the age of 55 (Pieraccini 1986). The paleopathological study of the skeleton reveals that Cosimo I suffered from diffused vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis, probably caused by his intense physical activity. Ossification and fusion of the anterior vertebral ligament and extensive ossification of the articular ligaments demonstrate that he was not affected by gout, as referred by the court physicians, but by DISH (Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis), an articular disease linked with diabetes and obesity. Ossification and fusion of the anterior right vertebral ligament, at the level of the 6 th, 7 th an 8 th thoracic vertebral bodies, is typical of DISH (Ortner 2003). At autopsy and embalming of the body (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005), the court surgeon tried to cut the skull at the level of the right parietal bone; only at the third attempt was he able to obtain a coarse horizontal cut. Finally, the skull was levered with a large chisel, which damaged the skullcap in three points. The study of the skeleton of Eleonora di Toledo (1522 - 1562), wife of Cosimo I, reveals that she was a woman with an anthropological age of 36 - 46 years, 1. 58 m tall, with medium low skull, high orbits and narrow face and nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The muscular insertions show a fairly good muscular activity (Robb 1994). The clinical history of Eleonora is characterized by many deliveries: she gave birth to 11 babies between the age of 18 and 32. Probably for this reason, from the age of 29, she developed pulmonary tuberculosis which, together with an outbreak of pernicious malaria, killed her at the age of 40 (Pieraccini 1986). A famous portrait by Bronzino shows a very thin and ailing Eleonora, affected by phthisis. The paleopathological study of the skeleton reveals that Eleonora suffered from a light form of rickets during childhood, as appears from the curvature of her tibiae (Ortner 2003). She presents pelvic skeletal markers of her numerous deliveries (Krogman and Isçan 1986). She also presented slight vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis. Finally, Eleonora suffered from severe dental disease, with destroying caries, probably due to loss of calcium caused by her frequent pregnancies. The study of the skeleton of Francesco I (1541 - 1587), 2 nd Grand Duke of Tuscany, reveals that Francesco I was a vigorous man, with an anthropological age of 40 - 50 years, a stature of 1. 74 m, a medium-sized skull and a narrow nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). The muscular insertions are those of a very strong man and the typical horsemen markers are almost all present (Belcastro et al. 2001). This new data contrasts with the traditional knowledge of an intellectual, sedentary prince, all dedicated to his alchemic studies (Berti 2002). He was affected by <b>acute</b> bronchitis and <b>bronchopneumonia</b> at the ages of 20 and 38 respectively and after 35 years of age he grew rather fat, suffered from gravel with colics (at 44 - 45 years) and died of pernicious malaria at the age of 46 (Pieraccini 1986). His great interest towards alchemy led him to fuse rock crystal, producing the so-called “Medicean porcelain” (Liverani 1936), a sort of luxury pottery very similar to china in his laboratory of Pitti palace. Therefore, he was certainly exposed to chronic poisonings and the toxicological study of his bone tissue will be of great interest to establish the exact grade of exposure to the different substances. The rumors according to which he with his second wife the Grand Duchess Bianca Capello were poisoned together, by his brother Ferdinando - who succeeded him on the throne – with an arsenical compound, are certainly false (Pieraccini 1986). Owing to the frequent use that contemporary surgeons made of arsenical mixtures in embalming and visceral processing (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005), toxicology is unlikely to be able to verify this legend. The paleopathological study of the skeleton demonstrates that Francesco I suffered from moderate vertebral and extra-vertebral arthritis (Ortner 2003) and reveals a well recovered fracture of the coccyx, probably the result of a fall. Finally, the section of the body of the sternum, clearly made to perform autopsy and embalming, is worth mentioning (Fornaciari and Marinozzi 2005). The Archduchess Joan of Austria, wife of Francesco I, was a very religious woman, as confirmed by the finding of her well preserved rosary, made in simple wood. Joan was an unattractive woman, as appears from numerous portraits and some contemporary reports even describe her as “humpbacked”. She had six very difficult deliveries and died during childbirth, following uterus rupture, at 30 years of age. Study of the skeleton reveals that Joan was a woman with anthropological age around 30 years, a height of 1. 57 m, medium-low skull and orbits and narrow face and nose (Krogman and Isçan 1986). Her weak muscular insertions witness scarce physical activity. There is section of the body of the sternum, clearly made to perform autopsy and embalming of the copse are confirmed by a section on the sternum of the body. The paleopathological study of the skeleton witnesses a large number of diseases, including: Prognathism, with a marked anterior projection of the mandible, resulting in the famous Hapsburg jaw; marked hyperostosis: ca 1 cm congenital thickening of the cranial vault (Ortener 2003); amelogenesis imperfecta: congenital malformation of the dental crowns (Aufderheide and Rodríguez-Martin 1998); severe scoliosis of the lumbar column with impressive deformity of the pelvis, responsible for her difficult deliveries and death by uterus rupture; incomplete congenital hip dislocation (Ortner 2003); clear signs of her numerous deliveries, such as enormous retro-pubic foveae, deep pre-auricular sulci (Krogman and Isçan 1986). A preliminary study of the skeletal remains of 9 immature individuals aged between 0 and 5 years allowed us to diagnose 6 cases of rickets, 5 cases of porothic hyperostosis and one case of hydrocephaly (Ortner 2003). It is very likely that rickets was caused by the scarce exposure to light of the children in the environment of the Renaissance and Modern age courts, while porothic hyperostosis was probably determined by prolonged nursing of the babies. These are the results of the explorations of the the first 15 out of 49 tombs, and include those of 9 children. The laboratory studies are still in progress. Another 39 burials, the majority of which are intact, will be explored in the next two years. The study of the Medicean funerary depositions and bodies will certainly expand our knowledge of the diseases, style of life, and tastes of the members of that dynasty, so important for the Italian Renaissance.
