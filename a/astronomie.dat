500|$|Triton {{is named}} after the Greek sea god Triton (Τρίτων), the son of Poseidon (the Greek god {{comparable}} to the Roman Neptune). The name was first proposed by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book <b>Astronomie</b> Populaire, and was officially adopted many decades later. Until {{the discovery of the}} second moon Nereid in 1949, Triton was commonly referred to as [...] "the satellite of Neptune". Lassell did not name his own discovery; he later successfully suggested the name Hyperion, previously chosen by John Herschel, for the eighth moon of Saturn when he discovered it.|$|E
500|$|Triton did {{not have}} an {{official}} name until the twentieth century. The name [...] "Triton" [...] was suggested by Camille Flammarion in his 1880 book <b>Astronomie</b> Populaire, but it did not come into common use until at least the 1930s. Until this time it was usually simply known as [...] "the satellite of Neptune". Other moons of Neptune are also named for Greek and Roman water gods, in keeping with Neptune's position as god of the sea: either from Greek mythology, usually children of Poseidon, the Greek Neptune (Triton, Proteus, Despina, Thalassa); lovers of Poseidon (Larissa); classes of minor Greek water deities (Naiad, Nereid); or specific Nereids (Halimede, Galatea, Neso, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe). For the [...] "normal" [...] irregular satellites, the convention is to use names ending in [...] "a" [...] for prograde satellites, names ending in [...] "e" [...] for retrograde satellites, and names ending in [...] "o" [...] for exceptionally inclined satellites, exactly like the convention for the moons of Jupiter. Two asteroids share the same names as moons of Neptune: 74 Galatea and 1162 Larissa.|$|E

2500|$|William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle {{purchased}} the estate in 1630 and immediately commissioned William Senior [...] "professor of arithmetique, geometrie, <b>astronomie,</b> navigation and dialing" [...] {{to make a}} map of his new possession. This map survives as a full colour double folio {{in the collection of}} the Welbeck Estate. Much of the surrounding landscape is woodland described as [...] "The Shroges" [...] and [...] "fless-greave wood", interspersed with [...] "Launds" [...] which Gaunt has identified as the survival of an ornamental landscape from the medieval period.|$|E
2500|$|The Ionian {{numeration}} {{used their}} entire alphabet including three archaic letters. The numeral notation of the Greeks, though far less convenient than that now in use, was formed on a perfectly regular and scientific plan, {{and could be}} used with tolerable effect {{as an instrument of}} calculation, to which purpose the Roman system was totally inapplicable. The Greeks divided the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes, and, by adding another symbol to each class, they had characters to represent the units, tens, and hundreds.

2500|$|Herman's {{first known}} {{translation}} was the sixth book of an astrological treatise Liber sextus <b>astronomie</b> by the Jewish writer [...] Sahl ibn Bishr. [...] It {{was released in}} Spain in 1138 under the title Zaelis fatidica (Prophesy). [...] Sahl ibn Bishr had been writing in the Greek astrological tradition. Ibn Bishr's first five books were preserved in the translation of John of Seville (Johannes Hispanus) (circa 1090 – circa 1150). The sixth book deals with three thematic topics regarding the influences on {{the world and its}} inhabitants. The work contains divinations based on the movements of the planets and comets.|$|E
2500|$|The young Morgan {{is sent to}} a nun convent after Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, {{aided by}} Merlin, kills Gorlois and rapes and marries her mother, who later gives him a son, Arthur (which makes him Morgan's younger half-brother). There, Morgan begins her study of magic arts, {{mastering}} seven arts {{and goes on to}} specialize in <b>astronomie</b> (astronomy and astrology) and healing. She later continues her studies under Merlin, but is interrupted when Uther betroths her to his ally King Urien of Gore (possibly Rheged). Unhappy with her husband, she takes a string of lovers until she is caught by King Arthur's newly married wife, Queen Guinevere to whom Morgan has served as a lady-in-waiting, with Guiomar (Chrétien's Guinguemar), and Guinevere intervenes to break their relationship to prevent the loss of honor. This incident (introduced in the Prose Merlin and expanded in the Vulgate Lancelot) begins a feud between Guinevere and Morgan, who leaves the court of Camelot to seek out Merlin and greater powers. The pregnant Morgan later gives a birth to Guiomar's son, who is said to grow up to become a great knight but is not named.|$|E
