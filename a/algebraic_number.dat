5|$|Noether's work Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern (Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in <b>Algebraic</b> <b>Number</b> and Function Fields, 1927) {{characterized}} the rings {{in which the}} ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the Dedekind domains: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0 or 1-dimensional, and integrally closed in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} fields are {{the field of}} {{rational}} numbers and the field of real numbers. The field of complex numbers is also widely used, not only in mathematics, but also {{in many areas of}} science and engineering. Many other fields, such as fields of rational functions, algebraic function fields, <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> fields, and p-adic fields are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and algebraic geometry. Most cryptographic protocols rely on finite fields, i.e., fields with finitely many elements.|$|E
50|$|The <b>number</b> of <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> {{involved}} by this {{expression is}} generally {{equal to the}} degree of , but it occurs frequently that an expression with less <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> may be computed. The Lazard-Rioboo-Trager method produced an expression, where the <b>number</b> of <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> is minimal, without any computation with <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> form a {{subfield}} of {{the real}} numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> and, moreover, if a and b are <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers,</b> then so are a+b, a−b, ab and, if b is nonzero, a/b.|$|R

5|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} <b>{{algebraic}}</b> <b>number</b> fields, and, more generally, of algebraic {{extensions of the}} field of rational numbers, is the central topic of <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|Global class {{field theory}} of {{characteristic}} 0: The module A is {{the union of}} the groups of idele classes of <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> fields, and G is the Galois group of the rational numbers (or some <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> field) acting on A.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how well complex <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> can {{be approximated by}} <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> of degree at most n. We also {{investigate how}} well complex <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> can be approximated by algebraic integers of degree at most n+ 1. It follows from our investigations that for every positive integer n there are complex <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> of degree larger than n that are better approximable by <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> of degree at most n than almost all complex numbers. As it turns out, these numbers are more badly approximable by algebraic integers of degree at most n+ 1 than almost all complex numbers. Comment: 34 page...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} properties of independence {{for the continued}} fraction expansions of two <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b> Roughly speaking, if the continued fraction expansions of two irrational <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> have the same long sub-word, then the two continued fraction expansions have the same tails. If the two expansions have mirror symmetry long sub-words, then both the two <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> are quadratic. Applying the above results, we prove a theorem analogous to the Roth's theorem about approximation by <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b> Comment: 21 pages, comments welcom...|$|R
25|$|One of the {{classical}} results in <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> {{theory is that the}} ideal class group of an <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> field K is finite. The order of the class group is called the class number, and is often denoted by the letter h.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the {{discriminant}} of an <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> {{field is}} a numerical invariant that, loosely speaking, measures {{the size of}} the (ring of integers of the) <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> field. More specifically, it is proportional to the squared volume of the fundamental domain of the ring of integers, and it regulates which primes are ramified.|$|E

5000|$|An {{equivalent}} formulation , is the following: If [...] {{are distinct}} <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers,</b> then the exponentials [...] are linearly independent over the <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b> This equivalence transforms a linear relation over the <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> into an <b>algebraic</b> relation over [...] {{by using the}} fact that a symmetric polynomial whose arguments are all conjugates of one another gives a rational number.|$|R
25|$|Cantor {{restricted}} {{his first}} theorem {{to the set}} of real <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b> The proof he was using demonstrates the countability of the set of all <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> form a field, many irrational numbers can be {{constructed}} by combining transcendental and <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers.</b> For example, 3π+2, π+√2 and e√3 are irrational (and even transcendental).|$|R

25|$|<b>Algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory {{interacts with}} many other {{mathematical}} disciplines. It uses tools from homological algebra. Via the analogy of function fields vs. number fields, it relies on techniques and ideas from algebraic geometry. Moreover, the study of higher-dimensional schemes over Z instead of number rings {{is referred to as}} arithmetic geometry. <b>Algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory is also used in the study of arithmetic hyperbolic 3-manifolds.|$|E

50|$|The sum, difference, {{product and}} {{quotient}} (if the denominator is nonzero) of two <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> is again <b>algebraic</b> (this fact {{can be demonstrated}} using the resultant), and the <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> therefore form a field Q (sometimes denoted by A, though this usually denotes the adele ring). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> is again <b>algebraic.</b> This can be rephrased {{by saying that the}} field of <b>algebraic</b> <b>numbers</b> is algebraically closed. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the algebraic closure of the rationals.|$|R

25|$|Commutative {{rings are}} much better {{understood}} than noncommutative ones. Algebraic geometry and <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory, which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, have driven much {{of the development of}} commutative ring theory, which is now, under the name of commutative algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (algebraic geometry, <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory and commutative algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. Similarly, Fermat's last theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of commutative algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both <b>algebraic</b> <b>number</b> theory and algebraic geometry.|$|E
