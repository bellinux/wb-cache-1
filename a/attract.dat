Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that <b>attract</b> porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that <b>attract</b> is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, four lymphocyte chemotactic factors (LCF-a, -b, -c and -d) {{were isolated}} from delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction sites of guinea-pig. In tests on guinea-pig lymphocytes, LCF-a <b>attracted</b> B cells, whereas LCF-b, -c and -d <b>attracted</b> T cells. We now report the chemotactic responses of human lymphocytes to the guinea-pig LCFs. LCF-a strongly <b>attracted</b> B lymphocytes and weakly <b>attracted</b> T lymphocytes, whereas LCF-b, -c and -d predominantly <b>attracted</b> T lymphocytes. In tests on T-lymphocyte subsets, LCF-b and -d selectively <b>attracted</b> OKT 4 subsets and theophylline-resistant T cells with helper phenotype. In contrast, LCF-c <b>attracted</b> OKT 4 and OKT 8 subsets, and both theophylline-resistant and sensitive subsets (i. e. cells with both helper and suppressor phenotype). The {{results indicate that}} the different T-cell subsets migrate selectively into sites of inflammation...|$|R

5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to <b>attract</b> females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to <b>attract</b> females, and females were observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E

5|$|Initially, this protest did not <b>attract</b> a {{great deal}} of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to <b>attract</b> attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E

5|$|Omphalea, {{like many}} {{other members of the}} Euphorbiaceae, {{possesses}} leaf nectaries that <b>attract</b> polistine wasps, which are predators of early instar caterpillars. The leaf nectaries also <b>attract</b> ants. The ants usually protect their host plant, eating both the nectar and plant-eating insects on it. However, they generally completely ignore Chrysiridia caterpillars, making it likely that the caterpillars possess a chemical deterrent as a primary defence. This chemical deterrent comes from the host plants. Omphalea species contain polyhydroxy alkaloids potentially sequestered or excreted by the caterpillar, the pupa and the adult moth.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show that the {{existence}} of <b>attracting</b> sets for quasiperiodically forced systems can be extended to appropriate skew-products on the cylinder, homotopic to the identity, in such a way that the general system will have (at least) one <b>attracting</b> set corresponding to every irrational rotation number ρ in the rotation interval of the base map. This <b>attracting</b> set is a copy of the <b>attracting</b> set of the system quasiperiodically forced by a (rigid) rotation of angle ρ. This shows the co-existence of uncountably many <b>attracting</b> sets, one for each irrational in the rotation interval of the basis...|$|R

5|$|Some bioluminous {{bacteria}} infect nematodes that parasitize Lepidoptera larvae. When these caterpillars die, their luminosity may <b>attract</b> predators to {{the dead}} insect thus assisting in the dispersal of both bacteria and nematodes. A similar reason {{may account for the}} many species of fungi that emit light. Species in the genera Armillaria, Mycena, Omphalotus, Panellus, Pleurotus and others do this, emitting usually greenish light from the mycelium, cap and gills. This may <b>attract</b> night-flying insects and aid in spore dispersal, but other functions may also be involved.|$|E
