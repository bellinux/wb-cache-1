5|$|In 33 BC Antony met his {{coalition}} {{partner on}} the river Araxes; they agreed that Antony should support Artavasdes I against Parthia and that the Median King should help Antony against Octavian. They interchanged parts of their troops. The domain of Artavasdes I was enlarged with parts of Armenia. Antony had returned <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> the Median king had taken from Oppius Statianus in 36 BC, and also took Iotapa along with him. With {{the help of the}} Roman reinforcements Artavasdes I was initially able to repulse the Parthian attack. Before the Battle of Actium, Antony called back his Roman troops without sending back the Median reinforcements. This time Phraates IV defeated Artavasdes I who was captured in 30 BC.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. Commercial {{activities}} contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

25|$|Walters {{was born}} Bedlinog, Glamorgan, Wales. Originally from Neath Grammar School, he first played for Glamorgan as a seventeen-year-old in 1923. Although he only made one score of over fifty in three full seasons, Glamorgan's batting was of such <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> he {{remained}} in the eleven, especially with his energetic fielding. The following year, his business as a surveyor and architect {{kept him out of}} the team {{in the first half of}} the season, but on returning he improved phenomenally with 116 in his first match against Warwickshire and 114 against Leicestershire. These innings showed him as a classically graceful batsman with many strokes and led to him being seen as an England prospect.|$|E

The valley and high temples as well as the causeway of the complex were richly decorated with over 10,000 sq. m (107,640 sq. ft) of fine reliefs that made the complex renowned in antiquity. The high temple is also remarkable for the variety of building materials used for its construction, from the alabaster and basalt floors to the fine limestone and red granite of the walls.|$|E

25|$|With Norway's {{entry into}} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization {{a large amount of}} funding was {{allocated}} to building new land airports. This and the technological development meant that seaplanes would no longer be a central part of the Air Force. Skattøra was during the 1950s the only NATO water air station. However, it would take over a decade before the other infrastructure and aircraft had reached such <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> the air station could be closed. Withe replacement of the Catalinas with Grumman HU-16 Albatross, the northern detachment of the 333 Squadron relocated to Andøya Air Station. The military activity at Skattøra was therefore terminated in March 1959. However, Albatrosses would continue to use the civilian airport throughout the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The Sprinter fleet that EMT {{inherited}} at {{the start}} of the franchise was in a very poor state. Problems ranged from basic and simple to major complicated faults. The fleet was put together from various sources - around four different previous companies, with some coming directly from passenger work but some that had been lying idle surplus to requirements off lease in sidings. East Midlands Trains has claimed that it will take the lifetime of the franchise to get the trains to <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> it is happy with. In addition to the various sources of the trains, passenger figures given to the Department for Transport prior to the franchise were incorrect, leading to a shortfall in the number of seats provided (a 26% decrease in capacity on route 2) compared with what was required.|$|E

In 1916 The Stage magazine gave the following review of an early concert resulting from their collaboration:Popular newcomers to the bill this week are Stanley Kirkby and Harry Hudson who are making their first appearance in the West End in a double turn.

The United States Government Department of Defense (DoD) created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) which is <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>that</b> sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of security.
