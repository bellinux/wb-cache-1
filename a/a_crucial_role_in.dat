A case-control study in lung cancer patients and controls in the Chinese Han population was investigated and suggested an association between PSMA4 and lung cancer. Furthermore, PMSA4 has also been implicated {{to be involved in}} the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and may therefore be a potential biomarker for clinical applications in AS.|$|R

5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten played <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} has been adopted {{recently}} in Albanian folklore (around the 18th century), the clarinet, or gërneta as it is called, {{is one of the}} most important instruments in Albania, especially in the central and southern areas. The clarinet plays <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> saze (folk) ensembles that perform in weddings and other celebrations. It is worth mentioning that the kaba (an instrumental Albanian Isopolyphony included in UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list) is characteristic of these ensembles. Prominent Albanian clarinet players include Selim Leskoviku, Gaqo Lena, Remzi Lela (Çobani), Laver Bariu (Ustai), and Nevruz Nure (Lulushi i Korçës).|$|E

5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> this process.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{can form}} an endosymbiotic {{relationship}} with other, larger organisms. For example, microbial symbiosis plays <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the immune system. The microorganisms {{that make up}} the gut flora in the gastrointestinal tract contribute to gut immunity, synthesize vitamins such as folic acid and biotin, and ferment complex indigestible carbohydrates. Some microorganisms that are seen to be beneficial to health are termed probiotics and are available as dietary supplements, or food additives.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{was born}} c. 495 BC, in Athens, Greece. He {{was the son}} of the {{politician}} Xanthippus, who, though ostracized in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later. Pericles' mother, Agariste, a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections played <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> helping start Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of Sicyon, Cleisthenes, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes.|$|E

40|$|The human {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) plays <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role(s)</b> <b>in</b> the viral {{life cycle}} {{and contributes to}} the onset of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBx caused the mitochondrial translocation of Raf- 1 kinase either alone or {{in the context of}} whole-viral-genome transfections. Mitochondrial translocation of Raf- 1 is mediated by HBx-induced oxidative stress and was dependent upon the phosphorylation of Raf- 1 at the serine 338 / 339 and Y 340 / 341 residues by p 21 -activated protein kinase 1 and Src kinase, respectively. These studies provide an insight into the mechanisms by which HBV induces intracellular events relevant to liver disease pathogenesis, including HCC...|$|R
5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, {{moved to the}} Greek island of Kos, {{teaching}} astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent to the stars.

5|$|The mid-level African easterly jet {{occurs during}} the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above West Africa, and the nocturnal poleward {{low-level}} jet {{occurs in the}} Great Plains of east and South Africa. The low-level easterly African jet stream is considered to play <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the southwest monsoon of Africa, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season. The formation of the thermal low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E
