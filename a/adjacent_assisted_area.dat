40|$|When {{an office}} relocates from London, its {{accommodation}} costs and salary costs decrease substantially. Some contacts must, however, be maintained {{with people in}} the capital, resulting in an increase in travel costs. Those increases are compared with accommodation and salary savings to show that the greatest net saving is usually obtained by a move to a town in the outer South East. Such moves have been very common. Few offices would obtain greater savings by moving to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas,</b> despite government incentives, which would have to be increased substantially to make those areas attractive. Similarly the replacement of 30 % of meetings by cheap teleconferences would not alone persuade many more offices to move there. Policies concerning many aspects of travel and communications would have to be combined before relocation to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas</b> would be worthwhile for more than a very small minority of offices. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid 1970 s, {{there have}} been {{attempts}} in West German regional policy to relocate jobs in the expanding service sector to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on the locational behaviour of the headquarters of industrial companies, the possibility and usefulness of a decentralisation of management jobs is examined. In view of the location requirements and the mobility of those tertiary functions requiring highly qualified personnel, an increasing importance accruing to the leading locations for headquarters can be expected. The financial incentives to relocate have proven too weak. A policy of forced decentralisation, however, would not be useful, because of the already decentralised location structure in West Germany when compared internationally. A further decentralisation would detract from {{the function of the}} leading locations as national growth centres and would endanger their international competitiveness. A policy to activate the endogenous development potential of disadvantaged regions is therefore more suitable than long-distance relocations of service industries to the <b>assisted</b> <b>areas.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The last {{pieces of}} the new {{regulatory}} framework for regional aid are finally coming together: following {{the adoption of the}} new regional aid guidelines last year, Member States have been engaged in devising <b>assisted</b> <b>area</b> maps, the last of which were approved on 16 September 2014; and, with the adoption of the general block exemption regulation this year, new instruments are being designed and i mplemented. More generally, over the last year or so, the European Commission has largely completed the reform programme set out in the 2012 State aid modernisation initiative. The reach of the reforms has been considerable: almost every substantive State aid text has been subject to review and revision, and there have been important procedural changes, notably in relation to transparency and new requirements for evaluation. Overall, there has been a significant recalibration of policy. In some areas, the s cope of compatible aid has been enlarged. By contrast, in the area of regional aid, there has been a significant tightening of some aspects of policy – notably regarding support for large firms in ‘c’ areas and the treatment of large cases of aid in all <b>assisted</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} new plant locations. In particular, the paper looks at whether discretionary government grants influence the location of new plants, and how effective these incentives are {{in the presence of}} agglomeration and urbanisation externalities – that is, benefits arising from locating near to other firms in the same industry or in an area with a diverse industrial structure. The specific government grants we consider are Regional Selective Assistance grants that are available in designated <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas</b> of the UK. We examine these questions using data on new plant entrants to the production sector in Great Britain, together with matched information on Regional Selective Assistance grant offers. We look at those new entrants that appear a priori to be more mobile – new plants owned by existing firms, (either UK groups or foreign multinationals). Our findings are of interest in the context of government policies concerned with regional variation in economic performance. We find evidence that regional industrial structure affects the location of new entrants. Firms in more agglomerated industries locate new plants near to others in the same industry, and firms are also attracted to industrially diversified locations. In line with other work in this area we find that foreign multinationals locate new plants near to other foreign-owned plants in the same industry. Fiscal incentives in the form of Regional Selective Assistance grants are found to have some effect in attracting plants to <b>Assisted</b> <b>Areas.</b> Agglomeration, regional grants and firm locatio...|$|R

Western governments, in seeking to attract internationally mobile capital have spent significant sums of public money on subsidies and grants.

However, this paper generates some estimates of these spillovers for both <b>assisted</b> <b>areas</b> and non-assisted areas in the UK, and questions the size of these social returns, arguing that productivity spillovers do not occur in regions where significant inward investment incentives are available.
