40|$|Thrombospondin 2 (TSP 2) -null mice, {{generated}} by {{disruption of the}} Thbs 2 gene, display a variety of connective tissue abnormalities, including fragile skin {{and the presence of}} abnormally large collagen fibrils with irregular contours in skin and tendon. In this study we demonstrate that TSP 2 -null skin fibroblasts show a defect in attachment to a number of matrix proteins, and a reduction in cell spreading. To investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for these abnormal cell–matrix interactions, we compared the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in wild-type and mutant fibroblasts. Isolation and analysis of gelatinases from conditioned media by gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography and gelatinolytic assays demonstrated that TSP 2 -null fibroblasts produce a 2 -fold increase in gelatinase A (MMP 2) compared with wild-type cells. The <b>adhesive</b> <b>defect</b> was corrected by treatment of TSP 2 -null fibroblasts with soluble TSP 2, with the MMP inhibitors BB 94 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 2, and with a neutralizing antibody to MMP 2. Moreover, stable transfection of TSP 2 -null fibroblasts with mouse TSP 2 cDNA corrected both the <b>adhesive</b> <b>defect</b> and the altered expression of MMP 2. Finally, MMP 2 was shown to interact with TSP 2 in a direct-binding plate assay. We conclude that TSP 2 {{plays an important role in}} cell–matrix interactions, and that a deficiency in the protein results in increased levels of MMP 2 that contribute to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>defect</b> in TSP 2 -null fibroblasts and could play a role in the complex phenotype of TSP 2 -null mice...|$|E
40|$|Desmosomes are {{prominent}} cell-cell contacts of all epithelia and heart muscle. They connect intermediate filaments of neighboring cells. Mutations of genes coding for desmosomal proteins {{have been identified}} in hereditary skin and heart diseases. In this thesis the pathogenesis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) was examined with the goal to define sequential stages of ARVC and to assign them to characteristic morphological and molecular alterations. To this end transgenic mouse lines were established and analysed with targeted mutations of the desmosomal adhesion protein desmoglein 2 (Dsg 2). The knock-in mouse strain DSG 2 MT/MT encoding a Dsg 2 mutant lacking part of its extracellular adhesive domain was analyzed. In addition, the cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out strain DSG 2 cKO/cKO was generated and characterized. Some of the DSG 2 MT/MT mice die already during embryogenesis while the survivors are born with morphologically inconspicuous hearts. These animals develop, however, extensive calcifying lesions on the basis of necrotic cardiomyocytes starting at 2 - 4 weeks. Immune cells infiltrate these areas and collagen fibres are deposited. The immune reaction subsides for the most part until the age of 12 weeks when mature scars are formed. The ensuing chronic phase is characterized by interstitial fibrosis. DSG 2 cKO/cKO animals present with an almost identical course of disease. The similarity of the developing phenotype in both strains shows that the primary loss of adhesion is most important for disease initiation and not Dsg 2 -dependent signaling pathways. Many publications have implicated the junctional plaque protein plakoglobin in ARVC pathogenesis, since plakoglobin is not only responsible for anchorage of actin and intermediate filaments but also influences wnt-pathway in the nuclues. The proposed pathomechanism stringently relies on reduced plakoglobin in the intercalated disc (ICD). To test this quantitative immunofluorescence analyses were performed to determine the expression level of plakoglobin in the ICD in relation to other ICD proteins in our murine ARVC models. Except for a decrease of Dsg 2 in the DSG 2 MT/MT mice and a loss of Dsg 2 in the DSG 2 cKO/cKO mice we could not detect alterations. In the case of plakoglobin two carboxyterminal antibodies did not show any alteration but an aminoterminal antibody revealed significant reduction. This observation could be confirmed in human ARVC tissue samples. An explanation is that the aminoterminal epitope of plakoglobin is lost in the pathologically altered ICDs. An influence on the wnt-signaling pathway, however, can not be derived from this observation. An increased mRNA expression was noted for skeletal muscle actin (ACTA 1) prior to lesion formation which increased further during disease progression. The mRNA expression was highest in the vicinity of newly-formed lesions that produced TGF-β. In addition, accumulation of actin at ICDs was noted in these areas. Activation of SRF signaling through Mrtf-a could be identified as a cause of the early increase in ACTA 1. Furthermore, cell culture experiments suggest that this ACTA 1 expression is due to Srf/Mrtf-a activation in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner. The lack of typical desmosomes in both mutant strains suggests a primary <b>adhesive</b> <b>defect</b> through the presence of either the adhesion-deficient Dsg 2 or the absence of Dsg 2 altogether which likely induces the Mrtf-a/SRF pathway. Scar-induced change of biomechanical properties and the increased perilesional TGF-β levels likely lead to an additional amplifying effect. Taken together, my observation support the hypothesis that alterations of cardiac biomechanics are crucial factors of ARVC pathogenesis whereas a redistribution of plakoglogin is not a major factor. Initial compensatory mechanisms become insufficient during adolescence and in situations of extreme physical activity thereby leading to acute alterations that may be lethal. The underlying pathomechanism amplify in a detrimental cycle whereby structural and functional alterations influence each other. If this critical phase is survived or is therapeutically mitigated, complex mechanisms are in place to support a rather slow further development of the disease...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that the impact-acoustic emissions contain information that can indicate {{the presence of the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>defects</b> in the bonding structures. In our previous papers, artificial neural network (ANN) was adopted to assess the bonding integrity of the tile-walls with the feature extracted from the power spectral density (PSD) of the impact-acoustic signals acting as the input of classifier. However, in addition to the inconvenience posed by the general drawbacks such as long training time and large number of training samples needed, the performance of the classic ANN classifier is deteriorated by the similar spectral characteristics between different bonding status caused by abnormal impacts. In this paper our previous works was developed by the employment of the least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier instead of the ANN to derive a bonding integrity recognition approach with better reliability and enhanced immunity to surface roughness.

40|$|In {{clinical}} dental {{practice it}} is often difficult or even impossible to distinguish and control interfacial <b>adhesive</b> <b>defects</b> from <b>adhesive</b> restorations using visual inspection or other traditional diagnostic methods. Nonetheless, non-invasive biomedical imaging methods like Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) may provide a better view in this diagnostic outline. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore evaluations of the marginal adaptation of class I resin composites restorations using Time Domain (TD) OCT. Posterior human teeth have been chosen for this study. The teeth were stored in 0. 9 % physiological saline solution prior to use. A classical round-shaped class I cavity was prepared and cavities were restored with Charisma Diamond composite by Heraeus Kulzer and using a system of etch and rinse boding. The specimens were subjected to water storage and then to thermo-cycling. Three dimensional (3 -D) scans of the restoration were obtained using a TD-OCT system centered at a 1300 nm wavelength. Open marginal adaptation at the interfaces and gaps inside the composite resins materials were identified using the proposed method. In conclusion, OCT has numerous advantages which justify its use for in vitro, as well as for in vivo studies. It can therefore be considered for non-invasive and fast detection of gaps at the restoration interface. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

40|$|Abstractβ-Catenin is {{important}} in liver homeostasis {{as a part of}} Wnt signaling and adherens junctions (AJs), while its aberrant activation is observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We have reported hepatocyte-specific β-catenin knockout (KO) mice to lack <b>adhesive</b> <b>defects</b> as γ-catenin compensated at AJ. Because γ-catenin is a desmosomal protein, we asked if its increase in KO might deregulate desmosomes. No changes in desmosomal proteins or ultrastructure other than increased plakophilin- 3 were observed. To further elucidate the role and regulation of γ-catenin, we contemplate an in vitro model and show γ-catenin increase in HCC cells upon β-catenin knockdown (KD). Here, γ-catenin is unable to rescue β-catenin/T cell factor (TCF) reporter activity; however, it sufficiently compensates at AJs as assessed by scratch wound assay, centrifugal assay for cell adhesion (CAFCA), and hanging drop assays. γ-Catenin increase is observed only after β-catenin protein decrease and not after blockade of its transactivation. γ-Catenin increase is associated with enhanced serine/threonine phosphorylation and abrogated by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition. In fact, several PKA-binding sites were detected in γ-catenin by in silico analysis. Intriguingly γ-catenin KD led to increased β-catenin levels and transactivation. Thus, γ-catenin compensates for β-catenin loss at AJ without affecting desmosomes but is unable to fulfill functions in Wnt signaling. γ-Catenin stabilization after β-catenin loss is brought about by PKA. Catenin-sensing mechanism may depend on absolute β-catenin levels and not its activity. Anti-β-catenin therapies for HCC affecting total β-catenin may target aberrant Wnt signaling without negatively impacting intercellular adhesion, provided mechanisms leading to γ-catenin stabilization are spared...|$|R

The new adhesions formed from small foci of α-actinin–GFP and paxillin-GFP, which grew in size. Subsequently, α 5 integrin entered the adhesions to form visible complexes, which served to stabilize the adhesions. α 5 -GFP also resided in endocytic vesicles that emanated from the leading edge of protrusions. Integrin vesicles at the cell rear moved toward the cell body. As cells migrated, α 5 vesicles also moved from a perinuclear region {{to the base of the}} lamellipodium.

This layer is usually less than 5 % of the whole joint, but all defects are expected in this region or on its boundary. True guided interface waves {{are probably the most}} sensitive to bond imperfections [1, 2], but they are inherently very difficult to generate and detect, therefore we should settle for the second best, namely leaky guided interface waves which lend themselves quite easily to practical applications.

5000|$|Fernandez {{developed}} {{the concept of}} the dehydron, an <b>adhesive</b> structural <b>defect</b> in a soluble protein that promotes its own dehydration. A dehydron consists of an intramolecular hydrogen bond that is [...] "underwrapped" [...] or incompletely shielded from attack by water in the protein's solvation shell. Dehydrons cause [...] "epistructural tension", that is, interfacial tension around the protein structure and thus promote protein-protein interactions and protein-ligand associations. The nonconserved nature of protein dehydrons has implications for drug discovery, as dehydrons may be targeted by highly specific drugs/ligands engineered to improve dehydron wrapping upon binding. Thus, dehydrons constitute effective selectivity filters for drug design, giving rise to so-called [...] "wrapping technology", a platform to design safer drugs. This technology was first applied by Fernandez and collaborators to redesign the anticancer drug Gleevec, in order to remove its potential cardiotoxicity. In a recent patent applying wrapping technology, dehydron-rich regions in a specific protein were targeted by Richard L. Moss and Ariel Fernandez to design drug leads to cure heart failure.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presented}} here outlines a technique for examining aerospace adhesive bonds using electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMAT). The main restriction {{on the use}} of bonded structures is the lack of a reliable, applicable non-destructive test. Simple acoustic theory shows that a shear wave at normal incidence to an interface should be a more sensitive probe of interfacing coupling than a longitudinal wave. Conventional piezoelectric shear transducers require a very viscous couplant which makes scanning problematic. The EMAT described here consists of a pancake coil, and a permanent magnet behind the coil provides a static magnetic field normal {{to the surface of the}} sample and the plane of the coil. The EMATs used have the advantage of generating broadband radially polarized shear waves, while requiring no acoustic coup[ant. They are also comparable in size to typical piezoelectric transducers. The broadband nature of the transducer gives it a high spatial resolution in the direction of wave propagation. Experiments performed on plate-like samples have successfully detected deliberately constructed defects, while monitoring the <b>adhesive</b> thickness. <b>Defects</b> have been identified using a C-scan technique using a single EMAT in send-receive mode from either side of the bond...|$|R
40|$|Classic cadherins are adhesion-activated cell {{signaling}} receptors. In particular, homophilic cadherin ligation can directly activate Rho family GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase), signaling molecules {{with the capacity}} to support the morphogenetic effects of these adhesion molecules during development and disease. However, the molecular basis for cadherin signaling has not been elucidated, nor is its precise contribution to cadherin function yet understood. One attractive hypothesis is that cadherin-activated signaling participates in stabilizing adhesive contacts (Yap, A. S., and Kovacs, E. M. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 160, 11 - 16). We now report that minimal mutation of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail to uncouple binding of p 120 -ctn ablated the ability of E-cadherin to activate Rac. This was accompanied by profound defects in the capacity of cells to establish stable <b>adhesive</b> contacts, <b>defects</b> that were rescued by sustained Rac signaling. These data provide direct evidence for a role of cadherin-activated Rac signaling in contact formation and adhesive stabilization. In contrast, cadherin-activated PI 3 -kinase signaling was not affected by loss of p 120 -ctn binding. The molecular requirements for E-cadherin to activate Rac signaling thus appear distinct from those that stimulate PI 3 -kinase, and we postulate that p 120 -ctn may {{play a central role}} in the E-cadherin-Rac signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is {{characterized}} by chronic intravascular hemolysis that generates excess cell-free hemoglobin in the blood circulation.

While the <b>adhesive</b> and vasomotor <b>defects</b> of SCD associated with cell-free hemoglobin are well defined, the vascular permeability phenotype remains poorly appreciated. We addressed this issue in two widely used and clinically relevant mouse models of SCD. We discovered that the endothelial barrier is normal in most organs in the young but deteriorates with aging particularly in the lung. Indeed, middle-aged sickle mice developed pulmonary edema revealing {{for the first time}} similarities in the chronic permeability phenotypes of the lung in mice and humans with SCD. Intravenous administration of lysed red blood cells into the circulation of sickle mice increased vascular permeability significantly in the lung without impacting permeability in other organs.

In process beginning times, the most right row of products between the cooling plate and the hot pressing machine has temperature 71. 2 ◦C that is higher than glass transition temperature (Tg) 60 ◦C. Those products’ temperature lead to evaporate a polyimide adhesive before hot pressing process beginning. The internal hot pressing process include the preheat times and the pressure time. In the preheat time the problem is a gap between lower and upper plate, was under specification (Under 1 mm) and leaded to adhesive polyimide stain. In the actuality this time requires temperature and low pressure that mean a gap within 1 – 2 mm (between lower and upper plate). In pressure times the hot pressing plate surface is not flat and products are pressed by insufficient force that it lead to generate an adhesive stain on flexible printed circuit boards. That force is measured by the pre-scale paper and a result, RGB color, is provided. And then color density (From standard color sample) and RGB color (From pre-scale paper) is found out the relation by Photoshop program and multiple regression theory using.

40|$|Large {{congenital}} diaphragmatic hernias {{are sealed}} using synthetic meshes or other biomaterials. In {{spite of the}} progress achieved {{in the development of}} improved biomaterials, there is still a demand for functionally enhanced meshes, in order to reduce both complication and recurrence rate. In the present work, {{on the way to the}} ideal mesh, already tested meshes were nano-surface modified and investigated in vivo for the first time. After coating of Ultrapro- and Prolene-meshes with six-armed star configured poly(ethylene oxide-stat-propylene oxide) based molecules (sP(EO-stat-PO)) a nanoweb spinning with short-time absorbable PLGA/sP(EO-stat-PO) (Polylactidecoglycolide with integrated sP(EO-stat-PO) molecules) was performed for air sealing at the diaphragm. For further sealing the meshes were additionally covered with a NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) -hydrogel. Six-armed sP(EO-stat-PO) -molecules react with each other. Up to four arms per molecule remain free, which can be loaded with active substances. This technology provides the possibility to modify meshes according to the requirements needed to influence wound healing or adhesion of surrounding cells. These requirements can vary depending on the localization of the implant and on the type of application. Iatrogenic generated diaphragmatic defects in growing rabbits were closed with three types of meshes (surface modified Ultrapro-, surface modified Prolene-mesh und Ultrapro-control mesh). Diaphragmatic mobility was radiologically determined preoperatively, two and four months after mesh implantation. After four months the meshes were explanted. <b>Adhesive</b> properties, <b>defect</b> size and mesh shrinkage were determined. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. In respect to their adhesive and histological properties as well as their impact on apoptosis and proliferation, on the number of myofibroblast, macrophages, and the collagen I/III ratio, surface modified base meshes showed no significant differences when compared to each other or to the control group. In contrast, the defect size was reduced for both modified meshes. Radiologically a good diaphragm excursion was seen. The surface modification described here shows an equally good biocompatibility compared to conventional meshes. Modified base meshes can therefore be used as carrier for bioactive substances. The possibility to apply these meshes at the diaphragm is further supported by the relative good diaphragm mobility, even after four months of implantation time...|$|R
40|$|Defects such as voids, cracks, delaminations, and {{so-called}} kissing bonds {{may influence the}} mechanical load capacity of adhesive joints. The {{purpose of this paper}} is two-fold. On the one hand it deals with the ultrasonic detectability of defects in bonds of epoxy (EP) and polyurethane adhesives (PUR) which had typical thicknesses of 0. 2 and 4 mm, respectively. The experiments were carried out on bonded tubes and shear test samples with artificially introduced defects of up to 2 mm diameter in the case for PUR. The diameter of tubes, their wall thickness and their length were 60 × 5 × 120 mm 3. On the other hand the behaviour of the bonds with the defects and their influence on the load capacity was investigated under static and dynamic load in a tensile-torsion test machine using standardized testing procedures. Ultrasonic A-, B- and C-scans were made using compressional and shear waves, both under perpendicular and oblique incidence, and by employing surface waves. All artificial defects including the kissing bonds were detected in addition to natural defects present. Furthermore ultrasonic measurements were carried out during mechanical loading in the test machine in order to study the behaviour of the defects. The measurements showed that changes in the sound velocity and ultrasonic transmission through the bonds become noticeable during loading, e. g. softening and hardening, as well as defect formation and growth of delaminations. During loading considerable generation of higher harmonics could be observed. In particular kissing bonds turned out to be a local source of the higher harmonics. The ultrasonic data were compared to the results of the destructive tests. The experiments showed that small <b>adhesive</b> and cohesive <b>defects</b> have little influence on the breakage strength in the quasi-static loading test but reduce especially the lifetime of the bonds under dynamic loading...|$|R
40|$|Adhesives {{are widely}} used and often {{preferred}} {{as a means of}} fastening parts together. Aircraft applications in bonding large areas or bonding parts of vehicle chassis, has brought about the need for highly reliable techniques in non destructive testing of adhesive bonds. Despite the many years of research there is still a need for further work to achieve a reliable method that can fully predict the performance of adhesive bonds under operating conditions. Among a wide range of different methods, a variety of ultrasonic techniques are used for non-destructive testing of adhesive bonds including pulse echo or through signal. In all cases the ultrasonic signal response is analyzed and conclusions are drawn with regard {{to the quality of the}} adhesive bond. Features of the ultrasonic signal, such as amplitude and frequency, are used for analysis. Even though there have been great improvements in ultrasonic testing of adhesive bonds, it is not always easy to extract conclusive information from the signals that discriminate clearly between the levels of bond quality. The method introduced in this paper enhances the capability of discriminating between varying degrees of bond quality when compared with existing methods in ultrasonic testing. A widely used method utilizes the magnitude of the returning signal as a measure of the level of contact between the adhesive and adherent. Higher amplitudes indicate lesser contact as less signal is transmitted through to the adhesive. However differences in output signal can be very small and in some cases is unable to discriminate between “good” and “bad” areas. Furthermore, measurement units are in terms of mVolts that could easily be lost in signal noise. The method introduced here uses Wavelet Packets for analysis of ultrasonic signals. Wavelets are analogues to sine and cosine functions of traditional Fourier analysis however they offer features, which overcome some of the limitations of traditional Fourier analysis in characterizing signal structures with sharp changes. Wavelet Packet filters are used to calculate the coefficients of the ultrasonic signal under investigation. These coefficients are subsequently linked to the quality of the adhesive bond. Research in this area revealed that substantial improvements could be achieved in differentiating signals between varying categories of defective areas. Non-defective areas were differentiated from those with defects by a factor of 20 when using the Wavelet Packet method. The Maximum Value method could only differentiate the same areas by a factor of 2. 5. Standard Ultrasonic testing equipment was used with accompanying software and an X Y Z test rig to enable scanning of specimens. The specimens were prepared from materials that are used in the automotive industry i. e. 0. 8 mm sheet steel and structural <b>adhesive.</b> The <b>defects</b> were strategically placed between the adhesive and metal for later comparison with the ultrasonic test results.

40|$|Adhesives have {{presently}} {{reached a}} stage {{where they have}} become part of everyday life both in a professional sense as well as for household applications. They offer advantages that in many respects surpass other joining processes such as bonding of large areas, joining a wide range and dissimilar materials; and without the need for special tooling or operator training, that is often required by many other joining processes. They are of course not a panacea to all fastening applications, but they can easily be described as the most versatile and most widely used joining method at present. Engineering applications have also benefited from the advantages offered by adhesives, but they are not as liberally used due to the severe consequences that may result from bond failure. Although adhesives can demonstrate their ability to fulfil the joining strength requirements under laboratory conditions, their application in industry proved to be not as reliable as expected. A number of parameters that can easily be controlled under laboratory conditions such as temperature, humidity, surface preparation and uniform adhesive application are not as easily observed in industry. Quality assurance during manufacturing can achieve excellent results; however even in these cases the probability of having <b>adhesive</b> bond <b>defects</b> is still present. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} post process inspection of adhesive bonds where risk levels require higher reliability than what is offered though process quality control. Adhesive bond inspection is a well researched area with respectable outcomes. Non destructive inspection techniques such as x-ray, thermal, and ultrasonic are well utilised in the inspection of adhesive bonds. However, despite all the effort in this area for more than forty years, there is still no singular technique that can achieve the confidence level required in some engineering applications. Therefore, the need for continuing research in the area of non-destructive evaluation of adhesive bonds is as necessary today as it has ever been. The research presented in this thesis, continues in the same endeavour as many other researchers; that of achieving the ultimate technique in adhesive bond inspection, capable of reaching the confidence level required for all engineering applications. The research in the thesis commenced with coverage of adhesives used for engineering applications and a study of the adhesion science that was considered necessary to enable an informed approach to the problem. Adhesive bond failure is also analysed through a literature survey as well as experimental tests on standard specimens. At the completion of the literature survey and preliminary tests, a decision was taken to follow the ultrasonic path of non-destructive testing of adhesive bonds. The reasons for this, are clearly outlined in the main body of this thesis but in summary, the literature has shown that ultrasonic evaluation is the most widely used technique by industry. Therefore, improvements on data analysis using existing techniques that exploit ultrasonic inspection have the potential to reach the widest spectrum of industrial applications. Ultrasonic inspection equipment was sourced that was capable of achieving experimental results to the accuracy level required in this research. A precision test rig was designed and constructed that was subsequently calibrated using computer based statistical techniques to ensure the validity of all results. Other ancillary equipment, such as a portable tensile testing device were also designed and constructed during the research as it became necessary. Research concentrated on techniques found to be inadequately researched in this domain. The first technique evaluated was to measure bond quality through the stress distribution in adherent and adhesive. Computer based Finite Element Analysis showed that the ability to detect variation in stress distribution at the adhesion interface is capable of revealing the local bond strength. Having found that there is no technique available at present that can measure the stress distribution at the interface, a different direction was taken that showed potential in achieving excellent quantitative results in the analysis of ultrasonic signals from adhesive bonds. This technique was rigorously evaluated and the results are systematically reported in this work...|$|R
