40|$|Although {{courts have}} {{traditionally}} relied primarily on prosecutors’ individual self-restraint and institutional self-regulation to curb prosecutors’ excesses and redress their wrongdoing, aspects of prosecutors’ conduct can be regulated externally as well. One {{potential source of}} external regulation is professional discipline. As lawyers, prosecutors are regulated by state courts, which oversee processes for disciplining lawyers who engage in misconduct. In responding to prosecutors’ wrongdoing, courts generally express a preference for professional discipline over civil liability, which is limited by principles of absolute and qualified immunity. Likewise, courts favor professional discipline over adjudicatory remedies such as reversal of criminal convictions or suppression of evidence, which are often unavailable because of the harmless error doctrine and other limitations. Part II of this Article discusses areas of misconduct for which prosecutors may be disciplined. It argues that, although few ethics rules specifically target prosecutors’ work, a number of generally applicable rules potentially address much of what courts regard as prosecutorial misconduct. In particular, courts have a degree of latitude to interpret the current rules to regulate <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> prosecutorial <b>discretion.</b> Part III offers a largely descriptive analysis of how ethics rules have been enforced to date in cases involving prosecutors’ professional work. It argues that although ethics rules may remain largely under-enforced as applied to prosecutors, the Nifong case may mark a potential turning point, as some disciplinary authorities now appear to be responding more forcefully to prosecutorial misconduct. Moreover, several disciplinary cases have been brought against highranking elected prosecutors, driven substantially by concerns about <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> charging power. Finally, Part IV considers the potential future role of professional discipline in responding to prosecutors’ <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> charging <b>discretion.</b> It focuses on commentators’ assumption that discipline is an unpromising route to redressing <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> because state courts in the disciplinary context, like federal courts in the adjudicatory context, must generally defer to prosecutors’ discretionary decision making. We argue that federal separations of powers principles, which account for federal courts’ deference in adjudicating cases, are not universally applicable to state courts. Indeed, state courts often exercise the authority to inquire into various aspects of prosecutors’ decision making, in both adjudicating criminal cases and sanctioning prosecutors who violate the constitution, statutes, or ethics rules...|$|R

25|$|The {{conditions}} of probation {{must be provided}} to the defendant {{in a written statement}} that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required. The District Court must state its reasons for imposing a term of supervised release where none is required by statute; appellate courts deem it inappropriate to assume that the sentencing court's reason for imposing a prison term likewise extends to its decision regarding supervised release. The conditions for probation must be reasonably related to the purposes of the Federal Probation Act, and the purposes sought to be served by probation (including rehabilitation of the probationer), the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement are factors considered in determining whether a reasonable relationship exists.

40|$|Administrative {{agencies}} play {{a substantial}} {{role in the}} formulation and implementation of national policy. Central to this role is their exercise <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> A normative consensus exists that such dis-cretion should be constrained by administrative deference {{to the rule of}} law. The courts of appeals are expected to insure that such discretion is constrained. The analysis reported below examines how effectively they fulfill that expectation. The findings suggest that agency success is related to politi-cal considerations, with agencies being successful when their decisions are consistent with the policy preferences of the judges. However, variables that captured elements of the legal model were also re-lated to success. Taken together, it appears that the appeals courts respond to both legal concerns and political preferences. Thus, the courts appear to fulfill the expectation that they will constrain the worst <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by imposing the rule of law. F or decades students of politics in the United States have recognized that ad-ministrative agencies are important political actors that play a substantial role in the formulation as well as the implementation of national policy.

25|$|Since {{probation}} {{is a form}} of punishment, {{once the}} sentence of probation has commenced, the court will run afoul of the double jeopardy clause if it increases the penalty. Probation's primary objective is to protect society by rehabilitating the offender. A person placed on probation is considered a probationer of the court as a whole, and not that of a particular judge thereof. When a defendant is placed on probation, he expressly agrees to be subject to supervision appropriate to a probationer, to avoid the more onerous regimen of a prisoner; accordingly, the defendant retains those rights of an ordinary citizen that are compatible with probationary status, although certain rights, such as the right against self-incrimination, are impaired. There is no requirement that probation must be granted on a specified showing. Probation is considered a privilege and not a right. The action of a district court in refusing to grant probation is not reviewable on appeal except possibly for arbitrary or capricious action {{on the part of the}} District Court amounting to <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b>|$|E
25|$|The NTEU {{has been}} famous for {{aggressive}} {{use of the}} courts to supplement their statutorily-limited powers to bargain and restraints on traditional labor tactics such as strikes and boycotts. In 1972, the union sued President Richard M. Nixon, challenging his decision to bypass Congress and postpone salary increases for all federal workers covered by the General Schedule. This lawsuit, NTEU v. Nixon, resulted in an unprecedented victory that required the government to pay over $533 million in back pay to federal employees. In another lawsuit, Boyce and Dixon v. United States, the removal of two IRS service center employees was reversed, establishing {{for the first time}} the principles that an agency did not have total discretion in penalizing employees and that mitigating circumstances could render an agency-ordered removal an <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> Shortly thereafter, in NTEU v. Fasser, the union won the right for federal employees to engage in informational picketing, an action previously deemed banned by federal law. During the Reagan and first Bush administrations, NTEU participated aggressively in numerous court battles. It took the issue of the constitutionality of random drug testing of Customs inspectors all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court in NTEU v. Von Raab and it successfully fought initiatives it viewed as anti-worker proposed by the head of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).|$|E

40|$|This Article {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} {{foundation for the}} field of international tax law. The Article refers to this foundation as the institutional competence of nations in global economic development. A nation’s institutional competence is its discretion to make decisions in pursuit of our collective goal of global economic development, discretion that is subject {{to a number of}} standards and limitations. The Article constructs the institutional competence of nations in global economic development from institutional economics, simple game theory, and the literature on social norms. The Article expresses the institutional competence of nations through standards and limitations that reduce the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>discretion</b> and address international collective action problems in the pursuit of global economic development. These standards and limitations allocate prescriptive jurisdiction among nations over the global income tax base. The foundation proposed by the Article would coordinate international taxation with the international regulation of trade. The Article also addresses the proper place of capital export neutrality in the hierarchy of values for economic development, the choice between territorial and worldwide tax systems, the evaluation of tax havens and appropriate responses, the use of anti-deferral regimes, and the possible need for a multilateral tax treaty. On this institutional foundation, {{the role of the state}} is both essential and subordinate: sovereignty becomes an instrumental value and national law-making is seen in terms of a conceptual subsidiarity, to use the European term, or a consequentialist federalism in the realm of global economic development. Moreover, non-state actors facilitate sovereign competition and the benefits that such a constraint on the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>discretion</b> brings to the world’s people...|$|R

40|$|The United States' {{record of}} {{participation}} in international institutions is paradoxical. No country {{has done more to}} promote the creation of new institutions. Yet the US has also failed to join some of the very institutions it has proposed, or has joined them only after making changes that leave the institutions substantially weaker. The ultimate rejection of the League of Nations, which America's own president had conceived and championed, is the classic example of this phenomenon; and nearly a century later, it remains one of the great puzzles of American foreign relations. This thesis proposes a novel explanation of the League defeat, showing the decisive influence of an idea from the country's constitutional tradition: the doctrine of checks and balances. According to this idea, power must be distributed across separate institutions {{in such a way as}} to give them overlapping jurisdictions and thus the capacity to restrain one another from going beyond their assigned limits. While President Woodrow Wilson, a proponent of British constitutionalism, considered the safeguards in the League plan sufficient, senators schooled in the American tradition of checks and balances objected to the plan's consolidation of power, arguing that it would inevitably lead to <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>discretion.</b> The difficulty <b>of</b> reconciling checks and balances with the inherent limitations of international delegation represents an enduring dilemma for American foreign policy-a dilemma made all the more poignant by the strategic value of international institutions. As the analysis of key cases reveals, the concern of US officials to avoid concentrations of power explains the country's rejection of the International Criminal Court, its scaling back of plans for the United Nations, and its second thoughts about joining the World Trade Organization. An ideational commitment has thus made it difficult for the US to convert its superpower status into lasting institutional form. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Investment-cash flow sensitivities {{can be attributed}} to overinvestment resulting from the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> managerial <b>discretion,</b> but also to underinvestment due to information problems. The Dutch corporate governance structure presents a number of distinctive features, in particular the limited influence of shareholders, the presence of large blockholders, and the importance of bank ties. We expect that in The Netherlands, the managerial discretion problem {{is more important than the}} asymmetric information problem. We use Tobin's Q to discriminate between firms with these problems, where LOW Q firms face the managerial discretion problem and HIGH Q firms the asymmetric information problem. As hypothesized, we find substantially larger investment-cash flow sensitivity for LOW Q firms. Moreover, specifically in the LOW Q sample, we find that firms with higher (bank) debt have lower investment-cash flow sensitivity. This finding shows that leverage, and particularly bank debt, is a key disciplinary mechanism which reduces the managerial discretion problem. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
