25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly. These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an <b>alternative</b> <b>power</b> <b>source,</b> such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and active materials may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

50|$|The {{boat was}} {{electrically}} driven with power supplied by {{a bank of}} batteries. Two 360 hp Sauter-Harlé DC electric motors were coupled to the single propeller drive shaft operating at 250 rpm. Together the motors weighed 27 tons. The original Laurant-Celvieva battery configuration was of 720 cells weighing 130 tons capable of delivering 1800A at 300V. The battery system exploded on first charging causing a fire, so a new layout of only 360 cells was installed. This led to a significant reduction of surface speed from 15 to 8 knots.

50|$|The Spirit Dining Car {{was renamed}} Murray in January 1963 and from 10 April 1964 it was {{transferred}} to standard gauge, as a spare vehicle {{which could be used}} if one of the three VRS buffet cars had to be pulled from service at short notice.

In practice Murray proved surplus to standard gauge requirements and by 24 July 1964 it was restored to broad gauge as a spare dining car available for hire, or, like Avoca, it could be used to replace Taggerty on the Bendigo line or Moorabool on the Gippsland line when either of those was due for maintenance. The name Murray was recycled from another E type carriage, one of two former Parlor cars used from 1906 on the Melbourne/Sydney express.|$|E
