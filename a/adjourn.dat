5|$|A {{government}} amendment {{designed to}} postpone a vote attracted much acrimony. This postponement was {{to allow for}} input from then ongoing investigations: the Law Reform Commission, the High Court Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners case on a Canadian marriage and the Constitutional Review Committee. Eventually, it was agreed to debate the bill but <b>adjourn</b> a vote indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Another two judges, Justice Brennan and Justice Dawson, dissented, Justice Brennan {{arguing that}} it would not be proper for judges to use their power to <b>adjourn</b> trials to put {{pressure}} on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote {{for most of the}} day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to <b>adjourn</b> for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to <b>adjourn</b> was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the name, an <b>adjourned</b> {{meeting is}} not related to the act of <b>adjourning</b> (i.e. [...] "an <b>adjourned</b> meeting" [...] does not mean [...] "a meeting that has been adjourned"). To reduce this confusion, an <b>adjourned</b> meeting is {{sometimes}} called a [...] "continued meeting".|$|R
50|$|The hearing may be <b>adjourned</b> by {{the defence}}, the prosecutor, or the court. However, if the defence does not {{consent to the}} adjournment, the bail hearing can only be <b>adjourned</b> up to 3 days.

5|$|On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, {{another of}} Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a {{petition}} for rehearing, which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court {{was set to}} <b>adjourn</b> until October.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to <b>adjourn</b> early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|To restore {{government}} services, on July 3, 2006, Corzine {{signed an}} executive order calling for an unprecedented Independence Day session of the General Assembly to work on presenting him with a budget. Immediately after listening to the governor's speech, the legislature voted by voice vote to <b>adjourn</b> the session. The General Assembly met again, without proposing a budget, the following day.|$|E

50|$|The State Legislature met {{first in}} Poughkeepsie, {{the seat of}} Dutchess County, on September 7, 1780, and <b>adjourned</b> on October 10. The Legislature reconvened at the Old City Hall in Albany, the seat of Albany County, on January 17, 1781, and <b>adjourned</b> on March 31. The Legislature reconvened again in Poughkeepsie, the Senate on June 15, the Assembly on June 18, and <b>adjourned</b> finally on July 1.|$|R

5|$|If, on {{nomination}} day, {{there are}} two or more candidates nominated for election, the returning officer must immediately <b>adjourn</b> the election so that a poll can be taken. He or she must assign each candidate an approved symbol to be printed on the candidate's ballot paper and announce by publishing a notice of contested election in the Government Gazette with information about the forthcoming poll, including the candidates' names and symbols, the date of polling day (which must be not earlier than the 10th day or later than the 56th day after {{the date of the}} notice) and the locations of polling stations.|$|E
5|$|Significantly, the {{possibility}} that Dietrich may have been acquitted differentiates this case from the unsuccessful 1979 McInnis v R. appeal. McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to <b>adjourn</b> the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This was clearly not the case with Dietrich.|$|E
5|$|The Indiana General Assembly {{is made up}} of two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate. Indiana has a {{part-time}} legislature that does not meet year-round. The General Assembly convenes on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January. During odd-numbered years the legislature meets for 61days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by April 30. During even-numbered years the legislature meets for 30days (not necessarily consecutively) and must be adjourned by March 15. The General Assembly may not <b>adjourn</b> for more than three days without a resolution approving adjournment being passed in both houses.|$|E
50|$|A meeting {{could be}} <b>adjourned</b> by {{unanimous}} consent. If {{no one has}} any further business {{at the end of}} a meeting, the chair simply declares the meeting <b>adjourned</b> without a formal motion or a formal vote.|$|R

40|$|We {{carried out}} {{a survey of the}} <b>adjourned</b> sales rate of the Japanese home video games from famitsu, a major weekly magazine, in order to {{construct}} a reference index of project management. We chose Playstation®(PS), Playstation 2 ® (PS 2) and Game Boy Advance ® (GBA®) as the platform and measured the fraction of the titles which were postponed for sale once or more times. The results are as follows: 1) During the first year after the release of the new platform, the rate of <b>adjourned</b> sale was high and gradually declined year by year. 2) In PS ® platform, <b>adjourned</b> rate was nearly 50 % in the first three years 1994 - 1996, and declined to 22 % in 2001. 3) In PS 2 ® platform, <b>adjourned</b> rate was 33 % in the first year 2000, and declined to 26 % in 2004, 4) In GBA ® platform, <b>adjourned</b> rate was 24 % in the first year 2001, and declined rapidly to 7 % in 2004. 5) Game titles scheduled to go on sale around the new-year holidays or {{at the end of the}} fiscal year showed a significantly higher rate of <b>adjourned</b> sale...|$|R
5|$|The Masonic Lodge is {{the basic}} {{organisational}} unit of Freemasonry. The Lodge meets regularly to conduct the usual formal business of any small organisation (pay bills, organise social and charitable events, elect new members, etc.). In addition to business, the meeting may perform a ceremony to confer a Masonic degree or receive a lecture, which is usually on some aspect of Masonic history or ritual. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, the Lodge might <b>adjourn</b> for a formal dinner, or festive board, sometimes involving toasting and song.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to <b>adjourn</b> a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call to order by the President of the Senate. After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may <b>adjourn</b> at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

25|$|From 1789 {{until the}} 1930s, Congress convened in December, stayed in session {{for five or}} six months, and then <b>adjourned</b> sine die. Occasionally, the demands of war kept Congress in session longer, but {{generally}} senators agreed with Vice President John Nance Garner who famously proclaimed, “No good legislation ever comes out of Washington after June.” By the 1950s, however, the schedule had changed. In 1956 Congress <b>adjourned</b> on July 27—marking the last time the Senate <b>adjourned</b> before the first of August.|$|R

5|$|During the siege, {{newly elected}} delegates from across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to <b>adjourn</b> and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers who were still waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being amended by the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House <b>adjourn.</b> His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} on June 20, the State House was mobbed {{by as many}} as 400 {{soldiers}} demanding payment. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Alexander Hamilton, then a delegate from New York, persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns. The soldiers did allow the members of Congress to peacefully <b>adjourn</b> that afternoon. That evening, a small Congressional committee, headed by Hamilton, met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council, asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers. The letter threatened that Congress would be forced to move elsewhere if the Council did not act.|$|E

5|$|The {{professorship}} {{was suspended}} for {{two years after the}} death of Robert Gandell in 1887. The electoral board had met to select a successor, but were unable to make a suitable appointment, and so obtained the permission of the university authorities to <b>adjourn.</b> When the board resumed in 1889, one of the previous applicants, David Margoliouth, re-applied for the position and was successful, even though none of the people recommending him made any mention of whether he knew any Arabic. As professor, Margoliouth taught the syllabus for the final examinations in lectures over two years, regardless of the stage that students had reached, and regarded it as bad luck if a student had to tackle the more difficult texts in one year and the easier texts in the next.|$|E
5|$|In June 1783, a {{different}} group of disgruntled soldiers from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sent Congress a petition demanding their back pay. When {{they began to}} march toward Philadelphia, Congress charged Hamilton and two others with intercepting the mob. Hamilton requested militia from Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council, but was turned down. Hamilton instructed Assistant Secretary of War William Jackson to intercept the men. Jackson was unsuccessful. The mob arrived in Philadelphia, and the soldiers proceeded to harangue Congress for their pay. The President of the Continental Congress, John Dickinson, feared that the Pennsylvania state militia was unreliable, and refused its help. Hamilton argued that Congress ought to <b>adjourn</b> to Princeton, New Jersey. Congress agreed, and relocated there. Frustrated with {{the weakness of the}} central government, Hamilton while in Princeton drafted a call to revise the Articles of Confederation. This resolution contained many features of the future U.S. Constitution, including a strong federal government with the ability to collect taxes and raise an army. It also included the separation of powers into the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches.|$|E
5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, the documents must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. The documents must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with the documents has not been served, the Court may <b>adjourn</b> the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that the documents may be served on that person.|$|E
