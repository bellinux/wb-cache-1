2500|$|Shear wave splitting, {{also called}} seismic birefringence, is the {{phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} a polarized shear wave enters an <b>anisotropic</b> <b>medium</b> (Fig. 1). [...] The incident shear wave splits into two polarized shear waves (Fig. 2). [...] Shear wave splitting is typically used {{as a tool for}} testing the anisotropy of an area of interest. [...] These measurements reflect the degree of anisotropy and lead {{to a better understanding of}} the area’s crack density and orientation or crystal alignment.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{considering}} electromagnetic waves, we {{note that}} the preceding discussion strictly applies to plane waves in a homogeneous isotropic non-attenuating medium, whereas in an <b>anisotropic</b> <b>medium</b> (such as birefringent crystals as discussed below) the electric or magnetic field may have longitudinal as well as transverse components. In those cases the electric displacement D and magnetic flux density B still obey the above geometry but due to anisotropy in the electric susceptibility (or in the magnetic permeability), now given by a tensor, the direction of E (or H) may differ from that of D (or B). Even in isotropic media, so-called inhomogeneous waves can be launched into a medium whose refractive index has a significant imaginary part (or [...] "extinction coefficient") such as metals; these fields are also not strictly transverse. Surface waves or waves propagating in a waveguide (such as an optical fiber) are generally not transverse waves, but {{might be described as}} an electric or magnetic transverse mode, or a hybrid mode.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} in the travel velocities of the two shear waves {{can be explained by}} comparing their polarizations with the dominant direction of anisotropy in the area. The interactions between the tiny particles that make up solids and liquids can be used as an analogue for the way a wave travels through a medium. Solids have very tightly bound particles that transmit energy very quickly and efficiently. [...] In a liquid, the particles are much less tightly bound and it generally takes a longer time for the energy to be transmitted. [...] This is because the particles have further to travel to transfer the energy from one to another. [...] If a shear wave is polarized parallel to the cracks in this <b>anisotropic</b> <b>medium,</b> then it may look like the dark blue wave in Figure 4. [...] This wave is acting on the particles like energy being transferred through a solid. [...] It will have a high velocity because of the proximity of the grains to each other. [...] If there is a shear wave that is polarized perpendicular to the liquid-filled cracks or elongated olivine crystals present in the medium, then it would act upon these particles like those that make up a liquid or gas. The energy would be transferred more slowly through the medium and the velocity would be slower than the first shear wave.|$|E

40|$|In an <b>anisotropic</b> linear-elastic <b>medium,</b> {{polarization}} of waves due to anisotropy {{of the medium}} is known to occur. In a way similar to phenomena in an <b>anisotropic</b> linear-elastic <b>medium,</b> {{polarization of}} waves takes place even in an <b>anisotropic</b> nonlinear-elastic <b>medium.</b> Polarized waves in a nonlinear-elastic medium are also soliton-like or step-shaped waves named simple waves. In an isotropic nonlinear-elastic medium, the simple waves are separated into two categories, non-coupled and coupled simple waves. The former are dilatational waves, while the latter are coupled waves with dilatational (u-component) and distorsional (v- and w-components) properties, where u and {v, w} are longitudinal and transverse components, respectively. In the case of <b>anisotropic</b> nonlinear-elastic <b>medium,</b> two kinds of simple waves mentioned above also appear with some modification due {{to the presence of}} anisotropy. The secondary waves produced by anisotropy are exact simple waves instead of only disturbance-type waves. Equations are numerically evaluated by use of an extended finite difference method expanded in a Taylor series. The wave source then has the form of a mountain ridge with a width - 4 <hx< 4, where hx is a distance x normalized by wave number h of P waves in the linear theory. 線形の異方性媒質におけると同様に非線形異方性媒質においてもまた波の偏光がみられる. 非線形等方性媒質において単純波(Simple waves) は二つの部類に分けられる,すなわち非結合単純波(Noncoupled simple waves) および結合単純波(Coupled simple waves) である. 前者は伸縮波(u成分) で後者はねじれ波(v,w成分) である...|$|R
