5|$|In {{his first}} major outing on the world stage, Chambers {{attained}} a new personal best at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, registering a time of 9.97s for third place in the 100m final. This made the 21-year-old the youngest ever World Championships 100m medallist. North Americans dominated the event as Maurice Greene and Bruny Surin took first and second place respectively, with record runs of 9.80s and 9.84s, respectively. The British sprint team Chambers, Gardener, Campbell and Marlon Devonish performed well in the 4Ã—100metres relay event as runners-up {{in a time of}} 37.73s behind the US team led by Greene. World record holder Maurice Greene was hitting his peak, winning three gold medals in Seville. However, at 21 years old, Chambers had achieved more than Greene had at that age: Greene's best was 10.08s in 1996 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> reached a major final.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dorothy appears naked outside was {{inspired}} by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> forgotten it. Principal photography of Blue Velvet began in February 1986 and completed in April. The film was shot at EUE/Screen Gems studio in Wilmington, North Carolina, which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.|$|E

25|$|Closer to {{the moment}} of the attack, the attacking planes were {{detected}} and tracked as they approached by an Army radar installation being operated that morning as a mostly unofficial training exercise. The Opana Point radar station, operated by two enlisted men (Pvts. Lockard and Elliot) plotted the approaching force, and their relief team plotted them returning to the carriers. Elliott called in the reading to the information center. The call was received by Pvt. Joseph McDonald. McDonald found Lt Kermit A. Tyler, the officer in charge at the barely operational warning information center at Pearl Harbor. He informed Tyler a large number of planes were coming in from the north <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> received a call like this before. Tyler told McDonald it was nothing.|$|E
25|$|The year 1907 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} in White's career. Arthur Wesley Dow, who was a very influential painter, photographer and teacher, then chaired the art department at Columbia University. Dow, who had known White for at least five years, asked White to become a part-time lecturer in art photography at Teachers College, which was part of Columbia. This was a strong testimony to the international recognition of White's artistry, since White himself had no education beyond high school <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had any training in art of any kind. He soon found himself in love with his new profession, which finally afforded him a modest but steady income while relieving him of any detail of managing a business (White was notoriously lax in billing and collecting from clients).|$|E

500|$|This London {{engagement}} was a {{new experience}} for Robey, who had only been familiar with provincial pantomimes and week-long, one-man comedy shows. Aside from pantomime, he had never taken part in a long-running production, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> had to memorise lines precisely or keep to schedules enforced by strict directors and theatre managers. The Bing Boys Are Here ran for 378 performances and occupied the Alhambra {{for more than a}} year. The theatrical press praised Robey as [...] "the first actor of the halls". He made two films {{towards the end of the}} war: The Anti-frivolity League in 1916 and Doing His Bit the following year.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Kansai, Kikuta worked {{first as a}} manga {{illustrator}} and later as an anime composer. The manga he illustrated, including one titled Raven, were done under the pen name [...] "Yuuki Ni Juu Roku". As an anime composer, he worked on The Adventure of Robin Hood and The Legend of Snow White. In 1991, Kikuta was hired by Square (now Square Enix), as a composer. After being rejected by his first choice, Nihon Falcom, he applied to Square without expecting to be hired, as they had many applicants for the job <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> played any of the company's games. At the interview, however, Nobuo Uematsu was attracted to their shared love of progressive rock, and he was chosen over 100 other applicants. He started off debugging Final Fantasy IV and creating sound effects for Romancing SaGa, as there were not enough game projects in development to open up new jobs for Square's new hires, but Kikuta was soon given game soundtracks to compose.|$|E
500|$|MacLean {{testified that}} in his discussions with George Orsborne, he had formed the {{impression}} that the captain was part-owner of the vessel. Orsborne had mentioned to him the possibility of engaging in profitable activities such as gun-running and smuggling. John Moore, the managing director of Marstrand's, stated that he had expected Orsborne to take Girl Pat fishing in an area of the North Sea where another Marstrand vessel was fishing successfully. When Moore was cross-examined, the defence's [...] "serious allegations" [...] were revealed. It was put to Moore that he had instructed George Orsborne not to go fishing, but {{to get rid of the}} vessel so that the company could claim its insurance value, of which Orsborne would be rewarded with a share. The defence alleged that the company was in poor financial shape, and that its ships were heavily mortgaged. Moore denied that he had made any such suggestion to Orsborne. The company, he insisted, was financially sound, the mortgages on its vessels were relatively low, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> discussed insured values with Orsborne. The defence further alleged that when taken out Girl Pat had been in an unseaworthy condition, inadequately provisioned and unfit for a normal fishing voyage. This suggestion was also denied by Moore.|$|E

500|$|Stauskas gravitated toward {{basketball}} {{during his}} childhood. Stauskas has never played ice hockey and barely has played street hockey. He tried soccer at age six, but {{a broken arm}} {{put an end to}} that. His first experience with basketball came {{as a member of the}} Ausra Sports Club, which is a Toronto-based traveling team for children of Lithuanian descent. Stauskas grew up a Raptors fan with Vince Carter as his favorite player. At age eight or nine, he [...] "played" [...] Carter one-on-one at a Raptors open practice for fans held at Air Canada Centre, which boosted his enthusiasm for the sport. Ever since then shooting a basketball has been his favorite form of recreation. He became so devoted to basketball that his head coach at Michigan, John Beilein, said in 2013,He doesn't know anything about hockey, he doesn't know anything about football. The other day we had him try to throw a baseball pass as a press breaker. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> thrown a baseball. In fifth grade, his parents gave him and his brother a choice on how to landscape their backyard: a swimming pool, a putting green or a basketball court, leading to the family backyard court. He and his older brother Peter would play at all hours and all conditions, including a 2006 ice storm that was so severe that, as he recalled in 2013, [...] "The ball couldn't hit the backboard without slipping off, but we didn't care." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} Operation Infinite Reach, Omar {{reportedly}} called the State Department, {{saying that the}} strikes would only lead to more anti-Americanism and terrorism, and that Clinton should resign. The embassy bombings and the declaration of war against the U.S. had divided the Taliban and angered Omar. However, bin Laden swore an oath of fealty to the Taliban leader, and the two became friends. According to Wright, Omar also believed that turning over bin Laden would weaken his position. In an October cable, the State Department also wrote that the missile strikes worsened Afghan-U.S. relations while bringing the Taliban and al-Qaeda closer together. A Taliban spokesman even told State Department officials in November that [...] "If [...] could have retaliated with similar strikes against Washington, it would have." [...] The Taliban also denied American charges that bin Laden {{was responsible for the}} embassy bombings. When Turki visited Omar to retrieve bin Laden, Omar told the prince that they had miscommunicated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> agreed to give the Saudis bin Laden. In Turki's account, Omar lambasted him when he protested, insulting the Saudi royal family and praising the Al-Qaeda leader; Turki left without bin Laden. The Saudis broke off relations with the Taliban and allegedly hired a young Uzbek named Siddiq Ahmed in a failed bid to assassinate bin Laden. American diplomatic engagement with the Taliban continued, and the State Department insisted to them that the U.S. was only opposed to bin Laden and al-Qaeda, at whom the missile strikes were aimed, not Afghanistan and its leadership.|$|E
