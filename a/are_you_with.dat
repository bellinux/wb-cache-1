25|$|The 2012 World Happiness Report {{stated that}} in {{subjective}} well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports. Happiness {{is used in}} both life evaluation, as in “How happy <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> your life as a whole?”, and in emotional reports, as in “How happy are you now?,” and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the World Happiness Report identifies the countries with {{the highest levels of}} happiness.|$|E

2500|$|In his posthumously {{published}} memoir Livin' the Blues (1992), {{edited by}} John Edgar Tidwell, Davis {{wrote of the}} period 1935 to 1948, [...] "... I worked {{with all kinds of}} groups. I made no distinction between those labeled Communist, Socialist or merely liberal. My sole criterion was this: <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> me in my determination to wipe out white supremacy?" [...] Some libraries removed his books, and he was the subject of FBI investigations in the 1940s and 1950s. Tidwell, however, states that Davis became a closet member of the Communist Party.|$|E

2500|$|Historian William Dalrymple {{asserts that}} the rebels were {{motivated}} primarily by resistance against a move (use of the Enfield Rifle-Musket) by the East India Company, which was perceived {{as an attempt to}} impose Christianity and Christian laws in India. For instance, when Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar met the sepoys on 11 May 1857, he was told: [...] "We have joined hands to protect our religion and our faith." [...] They later stood in Chandni Chowk, the main square, and asked the people gathered there, [...] "Brothers, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> those of the faith?" [...] Those British men and women who had previously converted to Islam such as the defectors, Sergeant-Major Gordon, and Abdullah Beg, a former Company soldier, were spared. On the contrary, foreign Christians such as Revd Midgeley John Jennings, as well as Indian converts to Christianity such as one of Zafar's personal physicians, Dr. Chaman Lal, were killed outright.|$|E
2500|$|Inclusion of Nature in Self Scale (INS) This {{single item}} {{question}} {{was designed to}} measure the extent that individuals include nature {{as part of their}} identity. This measure uses a pair of circles with one circle labeled self and the other circle labeled nature. Participants are asked to choose the pair of circles that best describes their relationship with the natural environment. There are seven pairs of circles that differ on the extent that they overlap. Individuals who are very connected to nature choose the pair of circles that completely overlap (scored as a 7) while individuals who are not connected to nature choose circles that are non-overlapping (scored as a 1). This scale has been shown to correlate positively with the New Ecological Paradigm Revised Scale, nature relatedness and simply walking in nature. [...] This scale {{can also be used to}} measure how connected to nature people feel in the moment (or at a state level) by changing the wording to [...] "how interconnected <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> nature RIGHT NOW. [...] " [...] Below is the INS scale.|$|E

In 2001 Mundine appeared as himself in the music video [...] "Like a Dog" [...] by the Australian rock group Powderfinger, whose frontman Bernard Fanning praised Mundine as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what}} the song is about and the fact that he's prepared to speak up for what he believes in." [...] In 2005 he featured in beatboxer Joel Turner's single [...] "Knock U Out". He then released his own debut single, [...] "Platinum Ryder", which also featured Nathan Merritt and Amos Roberts in the music video.

Mundine also {{appeared in}} the Brothablack music video, <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>With</b> Me Out There, along with league player Joe Williams. In 2008 Mundine featured in the video of a GetUp Mob version of the song From Little Things Big Things Grow.
