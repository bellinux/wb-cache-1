The highest-energy stereoisomer of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexafluorocyclohexane, in which all of the fluorines are ‘up’, is prepared in a 12 -step protocol. The molecule adopts a classic chair conformation with alternate C–F bonds aligned triaxially, clustering three highly electronegative fluorine atoms in close proximity. This generates a cyclohexane with a high molecular dipole (μ[*]=[*] 6. 2  D), unusual in an otherwise <b>aliphatic</b> <b>compound.</b> X-ray analysis indicates that the intramolecular Fax···Fax distances (∼ 2. 77  Å) are longer than the vicinal Fax···Feq­ distances (∼ 2. 73  Å) suggesting a tension stabilizing the chair conformation.
