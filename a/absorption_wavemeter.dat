5000|$|... #Caption: Lecher-line {{educational}} kit sold by Central Scientific Co. in the 1930s for teaching radio theory in college. It contains everything necessary, including an <b>absorption</b> <b>wavemeter</b> for independently measuring frequency.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An <b>absorption</b> <b>wavemeter.</b> It {{consists}} of an adjustable cavity calibrated in frequency. When the resonant frequency of the cavity reaches {{the frequency of the}} applied microwaves it absorbs energy, causing a dip in the output power. Then the frequency can be read off the scale.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{categories}} of wavemeters: transmission wavemeters, which have an input and an output port and are inserted into the signal path, or <b>absorption</b> <b>wavemeters,</b> which are loosely coupled to the radio frequency source and absorb energy from it.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>absorption</b> <b>wavemeter</b> is {{a simple}} {{electronic}} instrument {{used to measure the}} frequency of radio waves. It is an older method of measuring frequency, widely used from the birth of radio in the early 20th century until the 1970s, when the development of inexpensive frequency counters, which have far greater accuracy, made it largely obsolete. A wavemeter consists of an adjustable resonant circuit calibrated in frequency, with a meter or other means to measure the voltage or current in the circuit. When adjusted to resonance with the unknown frequency, the resonant circuit absorbs energy, which is indicated by a dip on the meter. Then the frequency can be read from the dial.|$|E
50|$|In 1915 Eastham left Clapp-Eastham to {{form the}} General Radio Company, first located {{on the third floor}} of a small flatiron {{building}} still standing at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Windsor Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It provided radio components such as a Precision Variable Air Condenser ($25.00), a Decade Resistance Box ($19.00), a Precision Variable Inductance ($24.00), and an <b>Absorption</b> <b>Wavemeter</b> ($60.00), and quickly profited from strong demand for military radios during World War I and the subsequent radio broadcasting boom. During World War II, Eastham led the LORAN radio navigation development efforts at MIT's Radiation Laboratory. He stepped down as president of General Radio in 1944 but retained the title of chief engineer until his retirement in 1950.|$|E
