Herein, we address the question of identifying the best pooling strategy when evaluating systems using precision-oriented measures in presence of budget constraints on the number of documents to be evaluated. As a quality measurement we use the bias introduced by the pooling strategy, measured both in terms of Mean Absolute Error of the scores and in terms of ranking errors. Based on experiments on 15 test collections, we conclude that, for precision-oriented measures, the best strategies are based on Rank-Biased Precision (RBP).

40|$|Priority {{setting for}} the {{evaluation}} of health technologies in the Netherlands is exclusively based on the scientific merits of individual research proposals. This process has not resulted in satisfactory allocation of resources. Therefore, societal criteria for setting priorities for health technology assess-ment have been proposed as an adjunct to scientific criteria. These societal criteria include the burden of disease, uncertainty about the (cost-) effectiveness of the intervention at issue, the potential benefits of the research project, and its potential impact on health care. To realize the full potential of this model for priority setting, a number of methodological issues need to be addressed. Joint efforts of researchers and policy makers in this field are necessary for future progress. Health technology assessment (HTA) in the Netherlands was introduced around 1982 when the Dutch Health Insurance Council was confronted with patients de-manding reimbursement of the costs of heart and liver transplantations that had been performed abroad. This debate stimulated a new policy, outlined in the paper on limits to the expansion of the benefit package (23). The policy held stated that, as a prerequisite for coverage in the benefit package, the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of all major new health technologies ought to be assessed. In 1988 the Dutch government recognized the need for a systematic approach to HTA, which resulted in the establishment of the Investigative Medicine Pro-gramme of the Dutch Health Insurance Council.

40|$|Public {{spending}} on agriculture in Nigeria is exceedingly low. Less than 2 {{percent of total}} federal expenditure was allotted to agriculture during 2001 to 2005, far lower than spending in other key sectors such as education, health, and water. This spending contrasts dramatically with the sector's importance in the Nigerian economy and the policy emphasis on diversifying away from oil, and falls well below the 10 percent goal set by African leaders in the 2003 Maputo agreement. Nigeria also falls far behind in agricultural expenditure by international standards, even when accounting {{for the relationship between}} agricultural expenditures and national income. The spending that is extant is highly concentrated in a few areas. Three out of 179 programs account for more than 81 percent of federal capital spending, of which nearly three-quarters go to government purchase of agricultural inputs and agricultural outputs alone. The analysis finds that many of the Presidential Initiatives—which differ greatly in target crops, technologies, research, seed multiplication, and distribution—have identical budgetary provisions. This pattern suggests that the needs assessment and costing for these initiatives may have been inadequate, and that decisions may have been based on political considerations rather than economic <b>assessment.</b> <b>Budget</b> execution is also poor. The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) best practice standard for budget execution is no more than 3 percent discrepancy between budgeted and actual expenditures. In contrast, during the period covered by the study, the Nigerian federal budget execution averaged only 79 percent, meaning 21 percent of the approved budget was never spent. Budget execution {{at the state and local}} levels was even less impressive, ranging from 71 percent to 44 percent. However, other sectors showed similar low levels of budget execution, suggesting that the problem is a general one going beyond agriculture. There is an urgent need to improve internal systems for tracking, recording, and disseminating information about public spending in the agriculture sector. Consolidated and up-to-date expenditure data are not available within the Ministry of Agriculture, not even for its own use. Without this information, authorities cannot undertake empirically-based policy analysis, program planning, and impact assessment. There is also a need for clarification of the roles of the three tiers of government in agricultural services delivery. This is important to reduce overlaps and gaps in agricultural interventions and improve efficiency and effectiveness of public investments and service delivery in the sector. Finally, applied research is needed to address critical knowledge gaps in several areas: (i) Spending on fertilizer programs makes up a sizeable portion of overall agricultural spending in Nigeria, yet very little is known about the impact of this spending. (ii) To date, only a small portion of the national grain storage system has been constructed, but if the entire network is completed as planned, the cost will be enormous. Supporting even the current modest level of grain marketing activities is consuming significant amounts of public resources. Is an investment on this order of magnitude desirable? What has been the impact of these investments? (iii) There is a need for an analytical study focusing on the economics of the National Special Program for Food Security (NSPFS). The total cost of NSPFS II is estimated at US$ 364 million. Detailed financial information about the NSPFS is not publicly available, however, making it difficult to assess whether the considerable investment in NSPFS I generated attractive returns, and whether NSPFS II merits support as currently designed. A rigorous external evaluation is needed to assess the performance of NPSFS and generate information that could be used to make design adjustments.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Dünya nüfusunun artması ile daha fazla konut, bina ve altyapı ihtiyacı oluşmaktadır. Enerji ve su tüketimi, atık üretimi devamlı olarak artmaktadır. Bu şekilde ilerlemesi durumunda sonraki nesiller için kaynaklar belirgin şekilde azalacaktır. Dünyada bu konu ile ilgili çalışmalar başlatılmış ve çeşitli çözüm arayışları üzerine projeler yapılmaktadır. İnşaat sektörü için sürdürülebilirlik kriterleri, belli ülkelerin önderliğinde sertifika sistemi olarak toparlanmıştırlar. Sürdürülebilir bina üretim süreci kapsam olarak geleneksel yöntemden farklı bir süreç takibini gerektirmektedir. Sürdürülebilir binaların ana özelliği tüm bina yaşam ve ölüm sürecini ele almasıdır. Proje yapım kararı ile başayan süreç; binanın tasarım, uygulama, işletme, bakım, onarım ve yıkım aktivitelerinin tümünü en baştan planlayan ve bu nedenle proje paydaşlarına sürecin en başından ihtiyaç duyan bir modele sahiptir. Ayrıca proje paydaşları arasındaki iletişim, sorun çözümleri ve karar verme metotları proje başlangıcında belirlendiği için yapıcı bir yaklaşım göstermektedir. Araştırmada tüm dünyada uygulanan sertifika sistemlerine de yer verilmiş olup genel başlıkları ve değerlendirme kriterlerinden bahsedilmiştir. Genellikle yeşil bina kriterleri aynı esaslar çerçevesinde belirlendiği saptanmıştır. Bu çalışmanın amacı kapsamında; Türk inşaat sektöründeki, proje paydaşlarının meslek, pozisyon ve deneyimleri ile sürdürülebilirlik algısı arasındaki ilişki incelenmiştir. Çalışma ölçümü için anket hazırlanmıştır. Ülkemizde henüz belirlenmiş sürdürülebilirlik kriterleri bulunmamaktadır; ancak yasal kurumlar tarafından düzenlenmiş; atık yönetimi, enerji tasarrufu gibi konular ile ilgili yönetmelikler mevcuttur. Dünyada yaygın olarak kullanılmakta olan sertifika sistemlerinden, LEED sertifika sistemi, ülkemizde en çok başvurulan ve uygulanmış olanıdır. LEED sertifika sistemi resmi verilerine göre Türkiye’de 308 adet bina projesi kaydı bulunmaktadır. Bu nedenle ankette ele alınan sürdürülebilirlik kriterleri, LEED sertifika sistemi değerlendirme kriterleridir. LEED kriterleri; sürdürülebilir araziler, su kullanımında etkinlik, enerji ve atmosfer, malzeme ve kaynaklar, iç hava kalitesi, yenilik ve tasarım olarak belirlenmiş olup, anket katılımcılarının bu kriterler hakkındaki farkındalığı değerlendirilmektedir. Sürdürülebilirlik kriterleri yanında kullanılan araç ve teknikler, risk ve fayda unsurları da ölçülmüştür. Değerlendirmeler; meslek, pozisyon ve deneyim grupları üzerinden yapılmıştır. Bu şekilde değerlendiren grupların yanıtlarındaki farklılıklar grupların özelliklerine göre değişkenlik gösterip göstermediği incelenmiştir. The {{rapid growth}} of the world {{population}} has increased the need for; buildings and infrastructures. This shift {{has given rise to}} problems ranging from enviromental pollution to  energy and water consumption. If this situation continues to deteriorate over time, there will be a shortage of resources  for the next generations. Therefore, there exist a number of studies which aim to improve the world's well-being and sustainable development. The term “sustainability” has emerged as an important agenda and integrated into all industries. Construction industry has long been associated with the detrimental effects to the earth.  Project stakeholders, both private and public sectors, are under pressure to look for accountable project evaluation in a sustainability contex. For this reason, project stakeholders will  need to pay particular attention to sustainability outcomes, given the current public awareness and global challenges on sustainability. To decrease the damage and to remove the green subjectivity, sustainability criteria are defined in  many countries. Further more, these countries developed certification systems to encourage industry to build sustainable environment. This study discusses results of the findings of a questionnaire survey interview with a group of senior practitioners in Turkish Construction industry, which was aimed at identifying existing perceptions on sustainability and the agreeable priority issues between stakeholders. This research includes the certification systems among the world to comprehend the head lines and assessment criteria. Local environment, culture, economy and technology factors are changing from country to country, however some certification systems have international criteria. The most popular certification systems are BREEAM (England), LEED (USA), Green Star (Australia), CASBEE (Japan), SB Tool (Canada) and DNGB (Germany).  Nearly whole certification systems include similiar subjects as; sustainable sites, water and energy efficiency, material and resources.  Also, internationally known certification systems have advantages like; contribution to sustainability, certainity of cost and planning, decreased risk, planning tool for execution, focusing on lifecycle and marketing benefits. As a content of this research, stakeholders’ responsibilities have reviewed. Sustainable building production process’s scope needs different path from traditional building production process and requires integrated project delivery model.  Moreover, whole life cycle duration  is the key objective of sustainable building production. The project team has determined from the beginning; since the process approaches from the decision of the project to the end of it. Who have been participating {{from the beginning of the}} project, comprises core team members, titled client, architect, contruction engineer, static engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, facility engineer, landscape architect, facility manager, primary contractor and interior architect. The fact of defining core team at the begining of the project provides communication among team members and generates problem solving and decision making methods. After composing core team, support team members who participates in some phases, have assigned according to project specifications. Support team members accept the same goal, schedule and operation with the core team members due to the fact that integrated projects requires coordination between team members. Eventhough, the members know their responsibilities, sharing the same goals for the project is very significant. Carefully prepared groups, roles and responsibility matrix clarifies services, assingments, leadership and support roles. In Turkey, while sustainability criteria have not been clearly defined, regulations like waste management, energy efficiency had been made by legal agencies. In this document, key performance criteria adapted from LEED certification score card due to the information from LEED original website. According to the official data, 308 project registered in Turkey but only 49 building have certification; 67 percent of gold, 24 percent of silver and 8 percent of platinium. Although the registration number is slightly high; the certificated project number is insufficient as compared with developed countries. The aim of this research is to assess the sustainable project steakholder’ perception in Turkish construction industry from the point of occupation, job title and years of experience. Therefore, a questionnaire survey was made to assess the perceptions of each attendent with respect to LEED sustainability criteria. Head lines of LEED certification criteria; sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, material and resources, indoor environmental quaility and innovation in design were indicated to assess the perceptions of survey participants. In addition, only surveying of LEED criteria were inadequate to measure awareness; so the equipments, methods, risks and benefits also considered. The utilized equipments and methods, which had inquired about, were; credit responsibility matrix, LEED project book, cost-efficiency analyse, energy simulation, light analyse, air condition analyse and whole lifecycle costing. After the methods, assessed risks were financal risk, complex of building, lack of design planning, lack of construction planning, lack of advanced supplier, inexperienced contractor and inexperienced organization. And benefits mentioned in the survey were; decrease of capital cost, decrease of operational cost, marketing benefits, improve of responsibility to environment, health and productivity and new job sources.   The questionnaire survey had sent to specialists, which have participated in a LEED certificated projects. Results have been analyzed in groups of occupation, years of experience and job title. Data received from the surveys were analyzed by t-test, ANOVA and Schaffe tests to explain the means between averages. Besides, Kendall’s W test was used to analyze the weighted scores’ adhesion with the help of coefficient of concordance.   From the results of tests, the project stakeholders, who had participated in a LEED certificated project, knew the most of sustainability criteria well  and had no complication to execute the criteria. On the other hand, according to the experience of respondents, brownfield development, bicycle storage and changing rooms, low-emitting and fuel-efficient vehicles, green power and certified wood criteria were detected as the option of “have no idea”. Therefore, due to the respondents, these criteria were commented as may not be used or may not be practiced much. Besides, the differences were observed between the ratings of architects and civil engineers. And also variations were clearly seen between different job titles. After the sustainability criteria; used equipment and methods part of the survey had analyzed. Managers were indicated as using equipment and methods like heat control, energy efficiency, light <b>assessment,</b> <b>budget</b> and cost management more than workers were. Since the managers have been in a position that gives the last significant decisions.   Because of the limited number of practiced green buildings in Turkey, risks were assessed majorly effective. Risk categories were evaluated incompatible among managers and workers; also between job titles. The risks of execution, financial risk and design and construction planning problems, advanced supplier, inexperienced contractor and organization were all found effective by respondents. All kinds of construction projects contain financial risk. In addition, design and construction planning risks can be solved by experienced team members. On the other hand, the lack of advanced supplier risk has originated from the construction industry. Material suppliers must improve themselves to serve the alterations in the sector by researches and developing teams. If green building production becomes more common, the sector will need to supply the materials that are demanded.   Consequently, in Turkish construction industry people should focus on the benefits of green building and improve the sector by seeing construction sector as a strategic sector, valuing customer, removing dishonest trading, improving and marketing scientific researches, sharing knowledge between universities and industry, defining long term strategies, improving cooperation before competition, making long term benefit-cost analyzes, enhancing awareness, evaluating the opportunities and encouraging researches.

40|$|Revenue {{authorities}} (RAs) {{have been}} adopted by some countries as an alternative delivery model for improved revenue administration. They are sometimes seen as a possible solution to problems such as low rates of tax compliance, ineffective tax administration staff, and corruption. The paper discusses RAs as a governance model, {{from the perspective of}} revenue administration and the almost universal desire to improve performance and compliance with the law. It compiles and analyses features of the model, examines reasons why revenue authorities were established, and explores the extent to which countries have evaluated the success of the model. It also assesses countries'' own perceptions about how this model may have contributed to tax administration reform. Further, the paper discusses data collection difficulties in carrying out an assessment using econometric analysis, and the problem of attributing changes in performance to a particular governance model. The paper concludes that while there are subjective perceptions among countries with revenue authorities that their model has led to improved revenue administration and has spurred modernization, there is no objective analysis that countries with RAs have performed better in this regard than countries without RAs.

40|$|Airport {{operations}} count {{data are}} used {{for a variety of}} purposes ranging from allocation of Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funding to environmental <b>assessments</b> and <b>budget</b> justification. Operations counts are hard to obtain at small, non-towered airports, which constitute the majority of airports in the United States, and are frequently estimated unscientifically by airport managers. Current acoustic and video counting technology is limited, but with the FAA NextGen mandate for installation of ADS-B Out transponders by Jan. 1, 2020, transponder data is rapidly emerging as a viable data source beyond traditional NextGen applications. To date, the NextGen literature has focused on the use of this technology for navigation, safety, and airspace management. This paper introduces a method of applying ADS-B data to fleet management and airport operations. With a 1090 MHz receiver and appropriate signal processing hardware and software, Mode S and Mode S Extended data can be used to track runway operations and fleet usage in an accurate and cost-effective manner...|$|R

The study is a development of the III Inter-institutional Family Support Plan (2011), drafted by the Basque Government's Department of Family Policy and Community Development, and its aim is to offer a series of sound criteria for improving existing programmes and ensuring the correct design and implementation of new ones in the future. It analyses 129 programmes and gathers data relative to institutional management and coordination, format, quality of the established aims, adaptation to the theoretical proposal for an Optimal Positive Parenting Curriculum, scientific base, use of the framework of reference for competences, working method, <b>assessment</b> techniques, <b>budgets</b> and publicity, among others. The results highlight the good quality of the programmes’ aims and content, and the poor systematic assessment of these same aspects. The study concludes with a series of recommendations for improving the initiatives, integrated into a proposal for a system of indicators to assess and implement positive parenting programmes...|$|R

Analyzing the spatial variability of WUE can improve our understanding on {{the interaction between}} carbon and water cycles at a large scale, which also provides a basis for improving the regional carbon <b>budget</b> <b>assessment.</b> Based on,China's eddy covariance measurements, we examined the spatial variation of China's WUE and its affecting factors. WUE showed a decreasing trend with the increasing altitude, which {{was the result of}} ecosystem type distribution resulting from the climatic gradient. After fully considering the vertical variation of WUE, we found that not only mean annual air temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean leaf area index (MLAI) but also mean annual total photosynthesis active radiation (MAR) affected the spatial variation of WUE. With the increasing MAT, MAP, and MLAI, WUE increased significantly but the increasing MAR decreased WUE. The spatial variation of WUE could be directly depicted by MLAI and altitude, the equation including which explained 65 % of the spatial variation of WUE. The effects of MAT and MAP on the spatial variation of WUE may be achieved through altering MLAI, while the mechanism underlying the effect of MAR on the spatial variation of WUE was still unclear, which should be the subject of future investigations. This study reveals the vertical variation of WUE and provides a new approach to generate the spatial variation in WUE, which will benefit the regional carbon <b>budget</b> <b>assessment.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.
