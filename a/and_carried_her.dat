Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again, running into traffic {{on the other side of}} the motorway. Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her, restrained her <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> to a waiting ambulance, at which point she was sedated. Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after midnight}} on January 4, 1974—around {{the time that}} he {{terminated}} his relationship with Brooks—Bundy entered the basement apartment of 18-year-old Karen Sparks (identified as Joni Lenz, Mary Adams or Terri Caldwell by various sources), a dancer and student at UW. After bludgeoning the sleeping woman senseless with a metal rod from her bed frame, he sexually assaulted her with either the same rod, or a metal speculum, causing extensive internal injuries. She remained unconscious for 10 days, but survived with permanent disabilities. Less than a month later, {{in the early morning hours}} of February 1, Bundy broke into the basement room of Lynda Ann Healy, a UW undergraduate who broadcast morning radio weather reports for skiers. He beat her unconscious, dressed her in blue jeans, a white blouse, and boots, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> away.|$|E

500|$|Urged on by a {{small but}} loud group of fellow Zimbabwean Olympians, the Zimbabweans {{improved}} after the break and, according to Byrom, [...] "ke the Austrian goal under siege" [...] throughout the second half. [...] With 50 of the match's 70 minutes gone, McKillop powerfully stroked a short corner that deflected off an opposing player's stick and flew high into the net to give Zimbabwe the lead. Now appearing supremely confident, Byrom reported, the Zimbabweans [...] "simply overran Austria with a splendid display of fast, attacking hockey", forcing eight short corners and four long corners during the second period to Austria's one long corner. Gillian Cowley made it 3–1 on 60 minutes, following up to score after Sandy Chick's free hit was blocked. McKillop rounded up the win four minutes later, collecting a [...] from Chase and smashing the ball home. Byrom reported [...] "incredible scenes of unrestrained joy" [...] at the final buzzer—"the Zimbabweans, tears streaming from their eyes, danced about the field hugging and kissing each other". Finally they hoisted Grant onto their shoulders <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> off the field.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a repair}} period at the Norfolk Navy Yard, De Soto {{conducted}} a cruise to New Orleans in May and June, putting {{in at the}} Philadelphia Navy Yard on 21 June. She stood down on the Delaware River five weeks later, this time sailing to Mexico. Off Vera Cruz, Mexico, on 17 September, the steamer watched {{the last of the}} French occupation end before sailing to Pensacola, Florida, for repairs in mid-October. De Soto proceeded south along the Florida coast on 22 October, stopping at Tampa Bay and Key West before arriving at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, on 17 November. The ship, in company with sidewheel steamer [...] and screw sloop-of-war , was there as part of Secretary of State William H. Seward's plan to purchase the Danish West Indies. The day after De Sotos arrival, however, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck the region and a tsunami swept the steamer from her moorings and threw the ship onto a wharf. Luckily, the next wave lifted the ship <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> back to deep water. With her bottom damaged and leaking badly, De Sotos sailors and carpenters spent the next ten days pumping water and repairing the hull. On 5 December, the steamer sailed north with the Danish Commissioner on board and the ship arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on the 17th.|$|E
500|$|As a toddler, little Maria once {{escaped from}} her bath and ran naked {{up and down}} the palace {{corridor}} while her distracted Irish nurse, Margaretta Eagar, who loved politics, discussed the Dreyfus Affair with a friend. [...] "Fortunately, I arrived just at that moment, picked her up <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> back to Miss Eagar, who was still talking about Dreyfus," [...] recalled her aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia. Her older sisters objected to including Maria in their games and once referred to Maria as their [...] "stepsister" [...] because she was so good and never got into trouble, recalled Margaretta Eagar in her own memoirs. However, on occasion the sweet-natured Maria could be mischievous. Once, as a little girl, she stole some biscuits from her mother's tea table. As a punishment for her surprising behavior, the governess and Alexandra suggested she be sent to bed; however Nicholas objected, stating, [...] "I was always afraid of the wings growing. I am glad to see she is only a human child." [...] Eagar noted that Maria's love for her father was [...] "marked" [...] and she often tried to escape from the nursery to [...] "go to Papa." [...] When the Tsar was ill with typhoid, the little girl covered a miniature portrait of him with kisses every night.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing in jeans and a black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Guernsey, Owain {{is remembered}} as Yvon de Galles. [...] He and his Aragonese mercenaries have been {{absorbed into the}} island's {{folklore}} as an invasion of diminutive but handsome fairies from across the sea. [...] The story goes that the shipwrecked king of the fairies was found unconscious on a Guernsey shore by a girl named Lizabeau. [...] When he awoke, {{he fell in love}} with her <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> across the sea to be his queen. [...] However, the other fairies soon decided that they wanted Guernsey brides, and invaded the island. [...] The men of the island fought bravely but were slaughtered wholesale, except for two men who hid in an oven. [...] The fairies then took Guernsey wives, which is said to be the reason for the typical Guernseyman's dark hair and short stature.|$|E

Sabatini was selected to represent Argentina in the 1988 Summer Olympics held in Seoul <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> country's flag in the opening ceremony. She {{went on to win}} the silver medal in the women's singles competition. In the final, she again faced Graf, who was bidding to turn her [...] "Grand Slam" [...] (all four majors in the same year) into what the media had dubbed a [...] "Golden Slam" [...] (all four majors plus the Olympic Games in the same year). Graf won 6–3, 6–3. Sabatini teamed-up with Graf to win the women's doubles title at Wimbledon that year. She also won 1988's year-end WTA Tour Championships.|$|E
2500|$|The unknown {{circumstances}} of Katherine's early death have fuelled speculation. [...] The persistent rumour {{is that she}} was shot as a highwayman on Nomansland Common in Wheathampstead, and died of her wounds while trying to ride back to a secret staircase entry at Markyate Cell. [...] Her body was supposedly discovered wearing men's clothing before her servants recovered it <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>her</b> home to be buried. Markyate Cell was built on the site of a 12th-century Benedictine Priory and takes its name from a cell, or smaller structure, that served the monastery. It was converted at great expense into a manor house in 1540, and then rebuilt in 1908 after a fire. [...] When a secret chamber was discovered by workmen in the 1800s behind a false wall next to a chimney stack, it gave new life to the legend. [...] However, there is a serious inconsistency in this story as there is no record of Katherine ever having lived in Markyate Cell, as it was leased to tenants after her father's death. [...] The property, which is not especially close to Nomansland Common, had actually been sold five years earlier.|$|E
