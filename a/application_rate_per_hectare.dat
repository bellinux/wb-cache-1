40|$|We {{introduce}} a world fertilizers model that {{is capable of}} producing fertilizer demand projections by crop, by country, by macronutrients, and by year. For each crop, the most relevant countries in terms of production, consumption, or trade are explicitly modeled. The remaining countries are modeled, for each crop, within a regional aggregate. The nutrient coverage includes nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K). In this report we present the data and procedures used to set up the model as well as the assumptions made. The fertilizer model interacts with the yield equations of the FAPRI-ISU model (Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at Iowa State University), and by means of a set of production elasticities, projects each nutrient’s <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> for each commodity and each country covered by the FAPRI-ISU model. Then, the application rates and the areas projected by FAPRI-ISU are used to obtain projections of fertilizer demand from agriculture on a global scale. With this fertilizer module, policies that directly affect fertilizer markets, such as input taxes or subsidies, quantity use restrictions, and trade restrictions, can now be explicitly formulated and evaluated. The effects of these policies on global agricultural markets and on greenhouse gas emissions can be evaluated with the FAPRI-ISU model and the Greenhouse Gas in Agriculture Simulation Model (GreenAgSiM). Also, any other policy affecting commodity markets such as input and output price shocks, biofuels mandates, and land-use change can now be evaluated with regard to its impacts on the world fertilizer markets. agriculture; fertilizer; nitrogen; phosphorous; policy analysis; potassium; projections. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} 77 growers, mainly in Hawkes Bay and Nelson, was {{undertaken}} {{during the summer}} of 1989 / 90. Personal interviews were conducted on each property. All growers were found to use herbicides for weed control, and all but one established herbicide strips with mown grass between. The major herbicide application period was spring. Three-quarters of growers relied on four herbicide formulations, amitrole, glyphosate, simazine and terbuthylazine/terbumeton. Of the residual herbicides used, 70 % were triazines. Grower knowledge about herbicides was found to be lacking. Grass species from the sub-family Paniceae were found to be the most problematic weeds, along with mallows, black nightshade, Californian thistle, tall willow herb and docks. These weeds were not adequately controlled by current weed control practices. Off-label use and herbicide damage to crop trees was noted. Growers were found to be applying herbicides through a wide array of equipment, through fan and off-centre nozzles with one to four nozzles on each boom. Only 37 % of sprayers were calibrated at least annually. During the survey 41 sprayers were calibrated, with only 17 % being correct within ± 5 % of intended application rate. Of those sprayers with errors over ± 5 % two-thirds were underapplying at mean error of 37 %, and one-third were overapplying at a mean error of 18. 1 %. Spray distribution patterns were found to be unacceptably uneven across the herbicide strip in most cases.

40|$|Background. Biofuel {{production}} {{is expected to}} increase significantly over the coming decades. Given that climate change mitigation is a major rationale for biofuel promotion, greenhouse gas savings have so far been a main concern, but {{there is a need to}} consider other environmental impact categories as well; for example ecotoxicity due to pesticide use in biofuel feedstock production. Ecotoxicity is an impact category that has often been omitted from agricultural Life Cycle Assessments in the past due to high complexity and lack of consensus regarding characterisation. Aim and scope. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the environmental performance of a selection of biofuel feedstocks in terms of pesticide use in cultivation and associated freshwater ecotoxic impacts. The feedstocks included are: maize (USA: two cases – with and without insecticide), rapeseed (Europe), Salix (Sweden), soybean (Brazil: GM and non-GM), sugarcane (Brazil) and wheat (Europe). Method. Pesticide use was investigated and typical field application scenarios were constructed. PestLCI 2. 0 was used as an emission inventory model to determine emissions to air and surface water and USEtox 1. 01 was used as a characterisation model to determine the potential freshwater ecotoxic impacts expressed in Comparative Toxic Units ecotoxicity (CTUe). Additional pesticides, soil and climate profiles were added to PestLCI and additional characterisation factors (CFs) were calculated in USEtox. Pesticide use and ecotoxic impact scores were allocated to biofuels and associated co-products through partitioning based on energy content (no co-products were assumed for Salix and sugarcane). Results. Sugarcane, conventional soybean and maize all require almost the same amount (18 − 19 g) of pesticide active substance (AS) for production of 1 GJ biofuel energy while rapeseed and wheat require 40 % and 80 % more respectively. Salix has by far the lowest pesticide AS <b>application</b> <b>rate,</b> both <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> and year and per energy unit of biofuel output. Concerning freshwater ecotoxic impacts <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> and year, Salix and rapeseed have the lowest scores (1 and 2 CTUe/ha/yr respectively) and sugarcane the highest: 89 CTUe/ha/yr - which is more than three times that of any other feedstock. The high score of sugarcane is associated with the use of the herbicides atrazine, 2, 4 -D and ametryn. In relation to biofuel energy output, the impact score of sugarcane is improved in relation to the other crops, due to high energy output. Production of 1 TJ biofuel energy from rapeseed causes an ecotoxic impact score of 31 CTUe, while production of 1 [*]TJ biofuel energy from wheat, maize (insecticide case), GM soybean and sugarcane give rise to ecotoxic impact scores 4, 10, 13 and 22 times larger, respectively. The European cases have lower ecotoxicity scores in general compared to the North and South American cases; probably an effect of stricter pesticide legislation in Europe. The top-three AS with highest ecotoxic impact scores are atrazine (sugarcane, 56. 8 CTUe/ha/yr), 2, 4 -D (sugarcane, 17. 8 CTUe/ha/yr) and chlorpyrifos (maize, 16. 1 CTUe/ha/yr) – all three of which are known to be problematic pesticides. Conclusions. There is a large variation in freshwater ecotoxic impacts of the assessed alternatives, both when compared to hectare and year and biofuel energy output. In addition, allocation influence the results significantly. There is no correlation between amount of pesticides used and ecotoxic impact caused, but location and timing are highly significant for emissions to various environmental compartments and hence ecotoxic impact scores. The largest challenges were encountered in relation to the dynamic character of pesticide use and in dealing with ecotoxicological effect data in calculation of new CFs. The models used are still immature and further research is needed to develop and make models fully compatible. Due to the limitations of the study, especially in relation to inventory of pesticide use, the ecotoxic impacts cannot be interpreted as fully representative for the crops in general. However, Salix has the lowest (most favourable) score in all environmental performance indicators and it is likely that a future biofuel from Salix would be associated with lower pesticide use and associated freshwater ecotoxic impacts compared to the other alternatives...|$|R

As highlighted by many Authors however, for Italy to quantify the amount of HWP will impose {{a number of issues}} mainly related to the inconsistency of the data provided by the National Institute for Statistic (ISTAT). New data collected by the National Forest and Carbon Inventory (INFC) will probably provide useful information. In the meantime, however, a comparison based on the forest area reported by INFC and data on HWP provided by ISTAT, both scaled at province level, could be proposed. The 2005 was assumed as reference year for both data sources. At this purpose, grouping the 103 Italian provinces in 9 groups mainly based on the 20 administrative regions, the Pearson coefficient of correlation was estimated, for each group, comparing the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT with (i) the forest area, (ii) the plantation area and (iii) the total forest area, including both plantations and forests. Possible outliers were identified estimating the harvest <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> of forest and considering the interquantile range of these values. A linear model was finally applied between the total forest area and the total amount of harvest estimated at regional level. The results highlighted a strong correlation between the amount of harvest reported by ISTAT and the forest area reported by INFC for 13 out of 21 regions. For 5 regions, including Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Umbria and Marche the amount of harvest was only correlated with the area of plantations. No correlation was detected for Toscana region. Based on the harvest <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare,</b> 5 provinces out of 103 were identified as outliers. The amount of harvest reported for 3 of these provinces (Cremona, Mantova and Pavia) was clearly referred to plantations. The analysis of the studentized residuals based on the application of the linear model, highlighted outliers values also for Piemonte region. As in the previous case, the amount of harvest reported for this region was probably partially referred to plantations. We could therefore speculate that for many regions data reported by national statistics as referred to the amount of harvest in forest, were statistically correlated with the forest area detected by INFC.

40|$|A {{series of}} apple tree {{spraying}} experiments {{was conducted to}} identify factors affecting agrichemical deposits from airblast sprayers and to relate deposit observations to biological responses in selected pest, disease and physiological systems. Factors addressed included tree canopy form, application volume, travel speed and sprayer type. Several tracers were evaluated and deposits quantified by wash-off removal from bulked leaf or fruit samples drawn from 10 - 15 spatially consistent 1. 5 m 3 zones per tree. Deposit data were expressed on a tissue area basis and/or {{as a proportion of}} the spray emitted (retention). Spray deposits were compared across 11 canopy forms to identify interactions with tree size, leaf area and canopy density and volume. A two-fold difference in deposits between canopies occurred when sprays were applied at a constant chemical <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> This variability was approximately halved when chemical <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> were adjusted {{on the basis of the}} canopy Tree-Row-Volume (TRV). The best TRV measurement system identified used across-row canopy spread measurements at half metre height intervals, rather than just a single measurement of canopy spread. Deposits were better correlated with TRV data than with any of the other canopy descriptors used. Canopy density was identified as an important covariate, but light penetration proved an unsuitable indicator of canopy density as it was strongly correlated with TRV. Deposit variations between zones within trees were consistent between all but the smallest canopy sprayed. Increasing the distance from the sprayer and/or increasing canopy penetration requirements reduced spray deposits. Spray retention across these canopies in full leaf ranged from 25 - 90 %, but tended to increase with decreased application volume. There was a ca. 10 - 15 % increase in deposits when spray volumes were reduced 4 - 5 times below those used in typical dilute spray volumes (ca. 2, 000 1 ha- 1). At high volumes with significant run-off, retention could ca. 50 % of that at lower volumes. Run-off losses could be related to TRV, with significant run-off occurring once application volumes exceeded one litre per 7. 5 - 11 m 3 of TRV. Surprisingly, average deposits on 5 m tail slender pyramid trees increased with increased travel speed over the range 1. 9 - 8. 8 km h- 1. Within-tree spray deposit distributions were not markedly affected by the travel speeds tested with air assistance volumes of ca. 30, 000 or 44, 000 m 3 h- 1. High, but relatively consistent within-tree deposit variability was a feature of deposits from axial fan, airblast sprayers, especially when used in intensive 4 - 6 m tall, single leader tree plantings. Within-tree deposit variability decreased with increased application volumes. Tower sprayers provided a more even vertical distribution of spray emission points and achieved different, but not necessarily more even, within-tree deposit distributions than airblast machines. Experiments on chemical thinning, mealybug (Pseudococcus viburni) and black spot (Venturia inaequalis) control, showed the biological responses could not have been predicted from the spray deposit measurements. However, combined assessment of spray deposits and biological effects greatly facilitated interpretation of both sets of data. ...|$|R

Based on a database from the Marais Poitevin (France), farm types were characterised using several indicators of management intensity and were used to generate several hypothetical landscapes which were compared to the current landscape according to their ecological and economic performances. A stage structured stochastic model was developed to asses the long term effects of grazing and mowing practices on ground nesting birds on contrasted landscapes.

Under competitive allocation, smaller farmers pump groundwater faster if farmers have a constant marginal periodic utility of income. However, {{it is possible that}} larger farmers pump faster if the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of relative risk-aversion is sufficiently decreasing in wealth. A greater farm-size inequality may either moderate or amplify income inequality among farmers.

Pellet formulation variables included quantity of mycelium per pellet (0. 0 - 3. 9 %), pellet size (2. 3 or 8. 3 mg), pellet <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> unit soil (0. 4 or 1. 0 % based on dry soil weight), and pellet storage (0 or 90 days). All of these variables affected efficacy. Nematode suppression was greatest (95 %) with 8. 3 mg pellets containing 3. 9 % mycelium that were not stored and applied {{at the rate of}} 1. 0 % of dry soil weight. Storage for 90 days reduced the efficacy of the pellets. The soybean cultivars tested were not equally good hosts of H. glycines, but reproduction of the nematode was reduced equally on all. The average suppression was 96 % (range 86 - 99 %). Similar suppression of reproduction occurred in tests with six races of H. glycines.

The nature of ESA and SSSI agreements and the procedures involved in concluding them are described and contrasted. Analysis of the available data indicates that the average payment <b>rate</b> (pounds <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> <b>per</b> annum) for SSSI agreements concluded exceeds that for ESA agreements. In contrast, arguments from first principles suggest that the ESA payment rate would be the higher. That the reverse is {{the case may be}} explained if SSSL agreements impose substantially more stringent conditions. A distinction is drawn between expensive agreements (under which the annual payment exceeds � 2000) and inexpensive agreements (the annual payment is less than � 2000). The data suggest that payment rates for expensive SSSI agreements may be excessive and capable of being lowered; and payment rates for inexpensive ESA agreements may need to be raised to attract reasonable levels of entry to these schemes. Alternatively, it may be that ESA arrangements are more cost-effective for concluding large, expensive agreements; and SSSI arrangements for concluding small, inexpensive agreements. ...|$|R
40|$|Fertilizer-nitrogen (N) {{management}} is a decisive factor in grass-based, intensive dairy farming, as it strongly influences {{economic and environmental}} performance but {{little attention has been}} paid to providing guidance on N-fertilizer management at an operational level to meet these criteria of performance. Essential criteria in operational N-fertilizer management were identified as target dry matter (DM) yield of herbage, growth period per cut, herbage N concentration, N use efficiency (NUE), amounts of unrecovered N and marginal N response. Statistical relationships between fertilizer-N <b>application</b> <b>rates</b> <b>per</b> cut and these criteria were derived from field experiments. These relationships were then used to explore the effects of the criteria on optimum fertilizer-N <b>applications.</b> Optimum fertilizer-N <b>rates</b> depended strongly on target levels for NUE, amounts of unrecovered N, growth period and DM yield of herbage. Calculations showed that target DM yield of herbage and growth period per cut are essential in estimating the effect of applied N on marginal N response, NUE and amounts of unrecovered N. The derived relationships can be used to explore the effects of changes in target levels of the criteria on optimum fertilizer-N applications. The study showed that operational fertilizer-N management set constraints to the decisions made at strategic and tactical management levels and vice vers...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{establishment}} by the Treaty of Rome in 1958, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) {{has had a}} {{huge impact}} on the agricultural sector in Europe and more widely. The original CAP altered production incentives, distorting input and output markets. The CAP has undergone a number of reforms, most recently the Fischler reform in 2003 which sought to remove the link between production and farm income support payments. Chapter 1 of this thesis offers some background on the Common Agricultural Policy and outlines the thesis. The move to `decoupled 2 ̆ 7 payments, and its impact on land rental markets, is the focus of Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis. In October 2011, the European Commission published proposals for further CAP reform (European Commission, 2011). At the heart of the proposals were reforms {{to the way in which}} Pillar I income support subsidies were distributed (both between Member States and between farmers within each Member State) and the linking of Pillar I direct income supports explicitly with environmental objectives (so-called 2 ̆ 7 greening 2 ̆ 7). Chapter 4 of this thesis explores the impact of changes in the distribution of subsidies upon the farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Chapter 5 discusses the findings and limitations of this research and suggests some future directions for research. I next offer abstracts of the three substantive chapters in this thesis. Abstract for Chapter 2 This chapter analyses the impact of the recent decision by the European Union to `decouple 2 ̆ 7 agricultural support payments from agricultural production on Irish farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. The land market participation decisions of Irish farmers are modelled using dynamic probit models while the extent of participation decisions are modelled using dynamic tobit models. Decoupling does not appear to have dramatically altered farmers 2 ̆ 7 land market decisions. One likely explanation for this is the cross-compliance obligation for farmers to maintain land in a state fit for agricultural production in order to receive their full payments. Abstract for Chapter 3 In this chapter the effect of decoupling on the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into agricultural rents in Ireland is analysed using a dynamic rental equation estimated with a two step system GMM estimator that accounts for expectation error and endogenous regressors. The findings illustrate the importance of institutional details in determining the extent to which subsidies are capitalised. In the period prior to decoupling Pillar 1 subsidies were highly capitalised into Irish agricultural rents in both the short and the long run. Depending on the farm system considered between 67 and 90 cents per euro of subsidies were capitalised into agricultural rents. In the post decoupling period the rate at which Pillar 1 subsidies are capitalised into Irish agricultural rents is found to have declined. This change is likely due to the short term character of the Irish agricultural land rental market, where 11 month rental periods predominate, and the freedom that the 2003 reform of the CAP offered farmers to consolidate entitlements established on rented land. The generally very short term nature of Irish agricultural rental contracts offered farmers an opportunity to consolidate entitlements that is unlikely to have arisen in other Member States with agricultural land rental markets characterised by long term contracts. The results in both the pre and post decoupling periods highlight the high degree of inertia of agricultural rents in Ireland, and the importance of accounting for dynamics when investigating the capitalisation of agricultural subsidies into land rents. The high degree of inertia in rents means that the impact of previously capitalised agricultural policy persists through time. Abstract for Chapter 4 The agricultural sector in Europe is heavily dependent on support payments made as part of the Common Agricultural Policy. In 2011, the European Commission published proposals for CAP reform which might lead to the introduction of a basic payment scheme consisting of flat <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> payments, possibly determined at a regional rather than national level. This paper explores the role that these payments may play in reducing farm income inequality in the UK and Ireland. Flat <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> farm payments are also considered to explore how a more dramatic reform would reduce inequality. Movement to flat <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> payments does not uniformly decrease inequality of Farm Net Value Added (FNVA) in contrast to what one may anticipate a priori, in fact in Scotland the inequality of FNVA increases in this analysis. In contrast, flat <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> farm payments reduce inequality substantially. 2017 - 03 - 3...|$|R
40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb {{and wild}} buckwheat, chamomile, mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. Ethofumesate, which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and Desmedipham. The high concentration of 200 g/L Ethofumesate leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (Metamitron + Quinmerac) or Goltix® Gold (Metamitron) the weed spectrum is broadened.

After enriching M. parvicella by dosing an emulsion of vegetable oil and Tween 80, an average aluminum <b>application</b> <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> mass of {{mixed liquor suspended solids}} of 3. 5 g kg- 1 d- 1 was applied. Specific sludge parameters such as the settling ability and the filament index were measured during the experiment. At the same time the effect of aluminum on the tendency to float and the hydrophobicity of activated sludge {{as well as on the}} morphology of M. parvicella was investigated. Microscopic investigations revealed a morphological modification of the filamentous bacterium during adding of AlCl 3. M. parvicella was found mostly inside of the activated sludge flocs and appeared as a short filament. Concurrently, an improvement of the settling characteristics of the activated sludge was observed. The tendency to float and the hydrophobicity of activated sludge decreased during the dosing. This is of significant relevance in the attempt to prevent floating sludge accumulation in activated sludge systems. The decrease of hydrophobicity of activated sludge during AlCl 3 dosage is probably related to the interaction of the aluminum species with the lipophilic substances and hydrophobic cell surface of M. parvicella (co-precipitation process) ...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen balance at farm {{scale is}} not only {{important}} to refine the site specific nitrogen fertiliser <b>application</b> <b>rate,</b> but also to estimate how much nitrogen fertiliser should be provided every planting season at district level. The nitrogen fertiliser stock for the district can be calculated by multiplying the total planting areas with nitrogen fertiliser <b>rate</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> The aims were to evaluate the nitrogen balance of terraced paddy field systems under conventional farmer practices and improved technologies during the wet season 2003 - 04 and dry season 2004 and to predict how much nitrogen fertiliser should be provided in every planting season for wetland cultivation in the Semarang district. The nitrogen input-output assessments were carried out in terraced paddy fields for the conventional farmer practices (CFP), conventional farmer practices + rice straw (CFP+RS), improved technology (IT), and improved technology + rice straw (IT+RS) treatments. Balances were computed based on the differences between input and output. Nitrogen originating from fertiliser (IN- 1), recycled rice straw (IN- 2), irrigation (IN- 3), and precipitation (IN- 4) were grouped as input. Nitrogen removal by rice grains (OUT- 1) and rice straw (OUT- 2) was considered as output. The input-output analyses showed negative nitrogen balances for all the treatments, both in the wet season 2003 - 04 and the dry season 2004. The more nitrogen deficit was observed when the nitrogen volatilisation was considered. The nutrient inputs, particularly coming from inorganic fertilisers, were not sufficient to replace the nitrogen removed by rice grains and straw. The application of only 50 kg of urea/ha/season with and without returning rice straw {{was not enough to}} reach the optimal yield and should be left out. To balance the nitrogen deficit and to improve cultural practices in wetland rice farming especially terraced paddy field system, about 200 - 250 kg urea/ha/season is recommended when the ammonia volatilisation is not considered, where as when the ammonia volatilisation is taken into account about 250 - 300 kg urea/ha should be added. When the rice yield of 5. 73 t/ha is targeted as reached in the IT+RS treatment even higher and the planting areas in the Semarang district is about 24. 833 ha for the wet season, the amount of urea should be provided will be about 4. 97 - 6. 21 million tons/season/district, meanwhile for the dry season when about 18, 440 ha wetland rice is expected to be cultivated is about 4. 61 to 5. 53 million tons urea/season/district should be available...|$|R
