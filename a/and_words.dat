5|$|Some of the {{properties}} that define human language as opposed to other communication systems are: the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign, meaning {{that there is no}} predictable connection between a linguistic sign and its meaning; the duality of the linguistic system, meaning that linguistic structures are built by combining elements into larger structures that can be seen as layered, e.g. how sounds build words <b>and</b> <b>words</b> build phrases; the discreteness of the elements of language, meaning that the elements out of which linguistic signs are constructed are discrete units, e.g. sounds <b>and</b> <b>words,</b> that can be distinguished from each other and rearranged in different patterns; and the productivity of the linguistic system, meaning that the finite number of linguistic elements can be combined into a theoretically infinite number of combinations.|$|E

5|$|GR is {{the better}} known of the two romanization systems which {{indicate}} the four tones of Mandarin by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence lets speakers discriminate between otherwise identical syllables <b>and</b> <b>words.</b> Other systems indicate the tones with either diacritics (for example Pinyin: āi, ái, ǎi and ài) or numbers (Wade–Giles: ai1, ai2, etc.). GR spells the same four tones ai, air, ae and ay. These spellings, which follow specific rules, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ai.|$|E

5|$|The {{order of}} service {{is similar to}} other Pentecostal churches, for example the Assemblies of God. There is no formal order of service, but most churches follow a routine of congregational singing, an offering/tithe collection, prayer, a sermon and an altar call.

During the congregational singing part of a service, a believer’s attitude of worship is often expressed through raising their hands in the orans posture.|$|E

At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug <b>and</b> <b>words</b> of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds <b>and</b> <b>words</b> follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre <b>and</b> <b>words</b> were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence.

Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters <b>and</b> <b>words.</b> Mr Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness.

5|$|Regulations for the {{performance}} of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only words, or a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music <b>and</b> <b>words</b> prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo.|$|E

At Time 1 (Senior Kindergarten), {{a series of}} multiple regressions indicated that, when controlling for oral language proficiency, letter name knowledge and non-verbal reasoning, L 1 phonological awareness was the only consistent and unique predictor of French <b>and</b> English <b>word</b> reading <b>and</b> <b>word</b> decoding performance. At Time 2 (Grade 1), French and English phonological awareness were consistent and unique predictors of French <b>and</b> English <b>word</b> reading <b>and</b> <b>word</b> decoding performance.

40|$|Image <b>and</b> <b>Word,</b> Especially in the Theatre", a bachelor´s thesis, {{addresses}} {{the phenomenon of}} image <b>and</b> <b>word</b> as fundamental constitutive components of a theatre performance. At the same time, the author considers and interprets their fundamental role in the arts in general. Taking as a basis the theory of semiotic and structural studies, the author attempts a confrontation with hermeneutics. The goal {{of the work is}} to define image <b>and</b> <b>word</b> not only {{from the point of view}} of noetic theather, which aspires to expression through symbols, but mainly to point out their tendency to be realized within the framework of the ontological principal of the theatrical arts. Although image <b>and</b> <b>word</b> are going through a significant transformation process within the arts, the author tries to prove that the theater, due to its performative character, can omit neither image nor word. The author uses as a primary basis the perception of image <b>and</b> <b>word</b> in their processuality stemming from the nature of temporality in theatrical arts...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the genetic and environmental etiology {{of the connection between}} speech <b>and</b> <b>word</b> reading in Chinese. A total of 371 pairs of Chinese twins (278 pairs of monozygotic twins and 93 pairs of same-sex dizygotic twins) were tested on speech discrimination and production, phonological skills, semantic skills, <b>and</b> Chinese <b>word</b> reading at the mean age 7. 4 years. Results of univariate genetic analyses showed moderate genetic influences on speech, semantic skills, <b>and</b> Chinese <b>word</b> reading, while moderate shared environmental influences on phonological skills. The genetic correlations among all the variables were significant. Results of testing several models on the link between speech <b>and</b> <b>word</b> reading supported a common genetic factor underlying speech, phonological skills, semantic skills, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> reading in Chinese. The present findings suggest that around 50 % to 60 % of individual differences of speech, semantic skills, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> reading in Chinese are due to genetic factors. Individual differences of phonological skills appear to be relatively less heritable than those in English. This may be partly {{due to the fact that}} the Chinese script does not map directly on any segmental phonological information. A single common genetic etiology for speech, phonological skills, semantic skills, <b>and</b> <b>word</b> reading suggests that development of these skills is highly connected...|$|R
