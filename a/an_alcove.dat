40|$|Abstract. Generalized alcoved polytopes are polytopes whose facet normals are {{roots in}} a given root system. We call a set of points in <b>an</b> <b>alcoved</b> polytope <b>a</b> {{generating}} set if there exists no strictly smaller alcoved polytope containing it. The type <b>A</b> <b>alcoved</b> polytopes are precisely the convex polytopes that are also tropically convex. In this case the tropical generators form a generating set.

25|$|Book-ending the Mappin Wing are the Tent Room—used for {{slightly}} less formal gatherings—and the ballroom—the centre of state life at Rideau Hall. It {{is in the}} latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place, members of the Cabinet are sworn in, ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials, and large-scale state dinners are held; as such, {{it is the second}} most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. A double-height space, it is lined with tall, arched windows between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable moulding trim surrounds most of the openings and, {{around the perimeter of the}} room, at the intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, clear span vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which hangs a Waterford Crystal chandelier, presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada's role in World War II. Also, in <b>an</b> <b>alcove</b> to the south of the ballroom's main door is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.|$|E
25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found around in his house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to <b>an</b> <b>alcove</b> in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E

A tall fireplace separated the alcove from the majority of the living room; a large man could stand in its opening. Another fireplace warmed {{the other end of the}} living room.

500|$|Criticism of Mills' {{design and}} its {{estimated}} {{price tag of}} more than $1 million (in 1848, [...] ) caused the society to hesitate. On April 11, 1848 the society decided, {{due to a lack}} of funds, to build only the obelisk. Mills' 1848 obelisk was to be 500 feet tall, [...] square at the base and [...] square at the top. It had two massive doorways, each [...] high and [...] wide, on the east and west sides of its base. Surrounding each doorway were raised jambs, a heavy pediment, and entablature within which was carved an Egyptian-style winged sun and asps. This original design conformed to a massive temple which was to have surrounded the base of the obelisk, but because it was never built, the architect of the second phase of construction Thomas Lincoln Casey smoothed down the projecting jambs, pediment and entablature in 1885, walled up the west entrance with marble forming <b>an</b> <b>alcove,</b> and reduced the east entrance to [...] high. The western alcove has contained a [...] since 1992–93. Also during 1992–93 a [...] was installed at the east elevator entrance decorated with a winged sun and asps to mimic Mills' 1848 design.|$|E
500|$|The {{exterior}} featured loggias, balconies, gables, {{groups of}} chimneys, and tiled roofs. [...] One {{of the chief}} features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terracotta, frescoes and stained glass. The entrance hall was built in Sienna marble, with a mosaic title floor and a coffered ceiling. [...] The original reception desk of the Waldorf Hotel became a registration desk when it merged with the Astoria Hotel in 1897. Beyond the lobby was the main corridor leading to the Empire Room, with <b>an</b> <b>alcove</b> off it containing the elevators and grand staircase. Near this was the Marie Antoinette parlor, which {{was used as a}} reception room for women. It contained 18th century antiques brought back by Boldt and his wife from an 1892 visit to Europe, including a bust of Marie Antoinette, and an antique clock which was once owned by her. The Empire Room was the largest and most lavishly adorned room in the Waldorf, and soon after opening, it became one of the best restaurants in New York City, rivaling Delmonico's and Sherry's. It was modeled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Empire in style, the Waldorf's restaurant feathered columns of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with ormolu work in the panels. The Waldorf State Apartments, consisting of nine suites, were located on the second floor. The apartments, including the Henry IV Drawing Room, the Francois V Bedroom, which was a reproduction of the room at the Palais de Fontainebleau, had their own music room and a banquet hall to seat 20, with a handsome china collection including 48 Sevres plates with European portraits.|$|E
