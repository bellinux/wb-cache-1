5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{character}} underwent {{a dramatic change}} in storyline when the role of Nick and Sharon's fourteen-year-old daughter Cassie was killed off after a car accident. This led Nick to seek comfort in the arms of another woman, Phyllis Summers, which resulted in an affair. Phyllis became pregnant with Nick's child, Summer Newman. Nick divorced Sharon and married Phyllis the following year. For years, however, Nick battled between his ongoing feelings with Sharon <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis.</b> His other storylines have included trying to seek independence away from his powerful father as well as multiple other relationships.

5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|The novel Bulldog Drummond {{begins when}} Drummond places an {{advertisement}} {{in a newspaper}} looking for adventure to lift the ennui {{of his life in}} post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for {{the health and well-being of}} her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At the end of the novel Drummond <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried. Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories, including The Black Gang and The Female of the Species.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor job because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> ultimately loses the client.|$|E
5|$|Just as Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{maternity}} leave ends and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) also returns, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is assigned {{with the task}} of forming a team and traveling down to Florida for three weeks to help Sabre launch a chain of retail stores. He and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) must select employees to accompany Dwight to Tallahassee. At first Dwight chooses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), Angela, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), but Andy refuses to let so many essential employees leave for three weeks. While letting Dwight have Darryl <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis,</b> Andy chooses Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to join the team instead, upsetting Dwight. Dwight then prematurely announces the picks and deliberately riles up the employees, hoping to change the team.

Sharon becomes pregnant; Nick goes back and forth between her <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis,</b> choosing Phyllis when Sharon lies about Jack being the father of the child. After being arrested for larceny a second time, Sharon checks herself into Fairview sanitarium (a psychiatric hospital) when her kleptomania becomes uncontrollable. She gives birth to a baby girl, Faith, who is stolen by Adam Newman (Nick's brother) and given to Jack's sister Ashley (Eileen Davidson) after he caused her miscarriage and hysterical pregnancy. Believing her baby is dead, Sharon grows close to Adam (who bonds with her out of guilt). Sharon and Adam are married, but when the truth about Faith is revealed the marriage ends. Several months later, Sharon shoots Adam when he tries to visit her at the Abbott cabin (mistaking him for a burglar); he survives.

5|$|Sources {{report that}} Bela Lugosi and Claude Rains were considered, {{with varying degrees}} of seriousness, for the role of Frankenstein's mentor, Pretorius; others report that the role was created {{specifically}} for Ernest Thesiger. Because of Mae Clarke's ill health, Valerie Hobson replaced her as Henry Frankenstein's love interest, Elizabeth. Early in production, Whale decided that the same actress cast to play the Bride should also play Mary Shelley in the film's prologue, to represent how the story— and horror in general— springs from {{the dark side of the}} imagination. He considered Brigitte Helm <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> Brooks before deciding on Elsa Lanchester. Lanchester, who had accompanied husband Charles Laughton to Hollywood, had met with only moderate success while Laughton had made a strong impact with several films including The Private Life of Henry VIII (for which he had won an Oscar) and Whale's own The Old Dark House. Lanchester had returned alone to London when Whale contacted her to offer her the dual role. Lanchester modeled the Bride's hissing on the hissing of swans. She gave herself a sore throat while filming the hissing sequence, which Whale shot from multiple angles.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the office learn that Dunder Mifflin is in {{financial}} trouble. In {{an attempt to get}} the worried staff under control, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jim call a meeting to provide optimistic viewpoints, despite the steadily worsening news. In a moment of quick thinking, Michael pulls out a murder mystery party game called Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets and forces the rest of the staff to play along. The staff slowly warms up to the game. It is set in Savannah, Georgia, and everyone has to adopt a Southern accent. Thanks to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> Lapin-Vance (Phyllis Smith), the game becomes a hit. Everyone present starts to play along, except for Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) who tries to get updates on the situation from corporate and Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) who shows up late to work and flees after being told he is a suspect in a murder. Jim, however, believes that the entire exercise is pointless.|$|E

The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), <b>and</b> <b>Phyllis</b> Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E
