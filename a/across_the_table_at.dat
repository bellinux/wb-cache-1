500|$|... "A Benihana Christmas" [...] was {{directed}} by Harold Ramis and written by Jennifer Celotta. It was produced by Stephen Merchant, Ricky Gervais, Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, and Ben Silverman. The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, different actresses were used because Andy and Michael failed {{to pick up the}} original waitresses, and settled for [...] "less attractive ones". At Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the joke failed due to poor casting. The waitresses that come to the office were supposed to be unattractive. Daniels stated that the actresses they hired for the role were [...] "too good-looking". During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>at</b> Rainn Wilson. It bounced off Dwight's glasses and landed in the glass of water he was about to drink. The producers chose not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable.|$|E
500|$|As the {{prominence}} {{of the issue of}} Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: [...] "Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it"). While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the Geneva Conference in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as [...] "this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" [...] and the Patriotic Front proposals as [...] "almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective". [...] Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his tardiness. Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>at</b> Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a [...] "foul-mouthed bloody fool!" ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neill {{was also}} {{put off by}} Carter's frugal {{behavior}} in cutting executive staff and reducing the scale of White House entertaining. Carter, a Southern Baptist, even ended the practice of serving alcohol other than beer and wine at the White House. As Carter's term began in early 1977, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were invited to the White House for a breakfast with the new President, where Carter served them sugar cookies and coffee. O'Neill, a man of expansive appetite, expected the until-then-traditional eggs and sausage. He looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>at</b> Carter and said, [...] "Mr. President... you know, we won the election." [...] Carter was a reform-minded executive who often clashed with O'Neill on legislation. The Speaker wanted to reward loyal Democrats with rewarding projects {{at a time when}} Carter wanted to reduce government spending. A continuing weak economy and the Iran hostage crisis made prospects bleak for Carter and the Democrats in the 1980 congressional and presidential elections.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{charges have}} been {{reported}} in previous years. In 1987, the BBC Panorama program Scientology: The Road to Total Freedom? featured an interview with former member Don Larson, who described Miscavige's physical violence towards a staff member. In a 1995 interview for ITV, Stacy Young, Miscavige's former secretary and the ex-wife of Hubbard's former public relations spokesman, Robert Vaughn Young, had previously asserted that Miscavige emotionally tormented staff members on a regular basis. [...] "His viciousness and his cruelty to staff was unlike anything that I had ever experienced in my life," [...] she said. [...] "He just loved to degrade the staff." [...] In an incident also witnessed and supported by Amy Scobee, Jeff Hawkins, a former marketing guru for Scientology, claimed to have attended a meeting where Miscavige [...] "jumped up on the conference room table, like with his feet right on the conference room table, launched himself <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>at</b> me—I was standing—battered my face, and then shoved me down on the floor". Church executive David Bloomberg confirmed that there was a physical confrontation during the meeting but stated that it was Hawkins who became belligerent and attacked Miscavige. In the confrontation Hawkins fell out of his chair and ended up putting a scissor lock on Miscavige's legs. Bloomberg stated [...] "Mr. Miscavige did not touch Jeff Hawkins." ...|$|E

40|$|Seven shallow {{monitoring}} {{wells and}} eight neutron access tubes (arranged in “nests ” with tensiometers) {{were used to}} take measurements of water-table and soil-moisture changes over periods of water-table decline following high groundwater levels and flooding in the riparian zone in Sep. -Oct. 2003 and Aug. -Sept. 2004. Water-table measurements were taken every 15 minutes using pressure transducers; these data were then calibrated with electric tape measurements performed periodically throughout the study. Neutron access tubes located near the wells (Figure 6) provided soil moisture profiles <b>across</b> <b>the</b> water <b>table</b> <b>at</b> each location. In 2004, the water-table fell below {{the bottom of the}} 4 original access tubes, and 4 additional deeper tubes were installed closer to the wells. The Skaggs method requires that soil moisture profiles remain in equilibrium with <b>the</b> water <b>table</b> (i. e. <b>the</b> vertical hydraulic gradient above <b>the</b> water <b>table</b> is zero).

6000|$|It {{certainly}} was hard upon Lady Tringle. She frowned {{and was going}} to walk on without any acknowledgment, when Lucy timidly went through a form of introduction. [...] "Aunt Emmeline, this is Mr. Hamel. Uncle Tom met him somewhere in the grounds and has asked him to come to luncheon." [...] Then Lady Tringle curtseyed and made a bow. The curtsey and the bow together were sufficient to have crushed the heart of any young man who had not been comforted and exalted by such words as Isadore had heard from Lucy's lips not five minutes since. [...] "And love you," [...] she had said. After that Lady Tringle might curtsey and bow as she would, and he could still live uncrushed. After the curtsey and the bow Lady Tringle passed on. Lucy fell into the rank behind Gertrude; and then Hamel afterwards took his place behind the Honourable Septimus. [...] "If you will sit there, Mr. Hamel," [...] said Lady Tringle, pointing to a chair, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> obliquely, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> greatest possible distance from that occupied by Lucy. There he was stationed between Mr. Traffick and Sir Thomas. But now, in his present frame of mind, his position <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> made very little difference to him.|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the recent}} WA 98 data of pi 0 spectra from central Pb+Pb {{collisions}} at the CERN SPS, we analyze the production of neutral pions for A+ collisions <b>across</b> <b>the</b> periodic <b>table</b> <b>at</b> sqrt(s) = 17 AGeV and 200 AGeV {{within the framework of}} the parton-cascade model for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The multiplicity of the pions (having pT > 0. 5 GeV/c) in the central rapidity region, is seen to scale as ∼ (N_part) ^alpha, where N_part is the number of participating nucleons, which we have approximated as 2 A for central collisions of identical nuclei. We argue that the deviation of α (≃ 1. 2) from unity may have its origin in the multiple scattering suffered by the partons. We also find that the constant of proportionality in the above scaling relation increases substantially in going from SPS to RHIC energies. This would imply that the (semi) hard partonic activity becomes a much cleaner signal above the soft particle production at the higher energy of RHIC, and thus much less dependent on the (lack of) understanding of the underlying soft physics background.

40|$|If ever a born-and-bred Vermonter {{seemed to}} belie his native {{heritage}}—that heritage of marble hardness and monosyllabic yep-nope monasticism—it was Wesley Alba Sturges, as gentle and gregarious a soul as ever nudged a class toward knowledge or called an acquaintance to casual talk <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> down <b>at</b> Mory 2 ̆ 7 s. Yet he retained a small deposit of Vermont gravel in his voice, that muted fog-horn which could turn so fast {{to an almost}} choking chuckle, half-embarrassed as though he might have missed the joke. He retained a large residue of Vermont rectitude in his dealings with other men, who totally trusted him. And behind the gentle friendliness, the casual camaraderie, lay a core of Vermont reserve. For he was, despite his flocks of friends, essentially a lonely man, not easily given to intimacies or confidences—a man whose deepest elations and distresses were always held in check within. To see him walk alone down Wall Street for coffee in the morning, for bourbon in the afternoon—that stiffly erect figure with the brisk short steps and the impeccably buttoned jacket (who ever saw him with his jacket off?) —was to sense some of the turmoil that must have tossed behind the tight facade...|$|R

[...] "You don't know what we have to bear, Lord Rufford. My husband has spent all my fortune,--which was considerable; and the Duke does nothing for us." [...] Then he took a bit of paper and, writing on it the figures [...] "£6,000," [...] pushed it <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> She gazed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scrap for a minute, and then, borrowing his pencil without a word, scratched out his Lordship's figures and wrote [...] "£8,000," [...] beneath them; and then added, [...] "No one to know it." [...] After that he held the scrap for two or three minutes in his hands, and then wrote beneath the figures, [...] "Very well. To be settled on your daughter. No one shall know it." [...] She bowed her head, but kept the scrap of paper in her possession. [...] "Shall I ring for your carriage?" [...] he asked. The bell was rung, and Lady Augustus was taken back to the lodgings in Orchard Street in the hired brougham. As she went she told herself that if everything else failed, £400 a year would support her daughter, or that in the event of any further matrimonial attempt such a fortune would be a great assistance. She had been sure that there could be no marriage, and was disposed to think that she had done a good morning's work on behalf of her unnatural child.|$|R
