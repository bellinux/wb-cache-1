25|$|Karaite Judaism or Karaism is a Jewish {{denomination}} {{that began}} in eighth century Baghdad to form a separate sect that rejected of the Oral Torah and Talmud, and placed sole reliance on the Tanakh as scripture. Thus, for example, Karaite understood Exodus 35:3 ("Do not light a fire in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> dwellings on the Sabbath day") as forbidding {{the use of any}} kind of fire on the Sabbath, including fires lit {{before the start of the}} Sabbath, which are permitted by the Oral Law. Karaites also do not adhere to widespread customs such as the donning of tefillin and the prohibition against eating milk and meat together on the grounds that such practices are grounded in the Oral Law.|$|E
500|$|Crackdown was {{critically}} acclaimed by game critics who praised the open-world approach. [...] Reviewers commented highly on the graphics of the game, both in its detailed city and large draw distances, and the cel-like shading of the characters; 1UP said that [...] "it's just better {{to let a}} game approach reality on its own aesthetic terms than to go hyperrealistic". X-Play stated, [...] "It's an absolute blast to play, and arguably {{one of the finest}} superhero games made thus far", and IGN stated, [...] "Overall the thrill of jumping like a mutant kangaroo from rooftop to rooftop is unrivaled!" [...] The co-op play feature over Xbox Live was well received; Eurogamer wrote, [...] "Being able to pick and leap into <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> friends' or even complete strangers' cities is likely to keep that buzz going though", and 1UP agreed, remarking [...] "That it represents the best, if not the first, online multiplayer sandbox game on a console is just gravy". Reviews did critique the lack of any appreciable story within the game, and how short the core game itself may be; IGN argued [...] "Crackdown won't last that long, it's uneven, and the story and the music are weak sauce".|$|E
500|$|Digby {{was tried}} {{on the same}} day as seven of his {{surviving}} co-conspirators, in Westminster Hall, on Monday 27 January 1606. [...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The reply came back, [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E

500|$|Each of the condemned, said Coke, {{would be}} drawn {{backwards}} to his death, by a horse, his head near the ground. [...] He {{was to be}} [...] "put to death halfway between heaven and earth as unworthy of both". [...] His genitals would be cut off and burnt before his eyes, and his bowels and heart then removed. [...] Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed {{so that they might}} become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. [...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more cheerfully to the gallows." [...] The response was short: [...] "God forgive you, and we do." ...|$|E

Now, the meeting is open for prayer." [...] Spontaneous prayers come forth from several individuals at every meeting, followed by more confessions of sin and wrongdoing among church leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Southey's {{contemporary}} James Losh {{believed that}} the poem was [...] "superior to anything before written by Southey". A letter from Charles Lamb to Southey dated 6 May 1815 said, [...] "I have, since the receipt of your present, read it quite through again, and with no diminished pleasure. I don't know whether I ought {{to say that it}} has given me more pleasure than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> long poems. Kehama is doubtless more powerful, but I don't feel that firm footing in it that I do in Roderick". An anonymous review in the December 1814 Theatrical Inquisitor argued, [...] "It is scarcely possible to view the errors of exalted genius without breathing a sigh of compassion and regret. The generous mind feels humiliated at the contemplation [...] Such are the feelings that must be excited by the reader of Southey's poems [...] The story of the present poem is interesting, and would probably have made an excellent romance. It has, however, several capital defects, that make it altogether unfit for an heroic poem".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that Rabbi Zerachiah ben Isaac Ha-Levi Gerondi (Hebrew: רבינו זרחיה הלוי), the Baal Ha-Maor (author of the book Ha-Maor), went as far as to write that [...] "he who does not eat warm food (on Shabbos) should be checked out to see if he is not a Min (a heretic)". The reasoning beyond such austerity is that the Karaites interpreted the Torah verse, [...] "You shall not [...] (Heb: bi‘er the pi‘el form of ba‘ar) a fire in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> dwellings on the day of Shabbat" [...] to indicate that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. In Rabbinic Judaism however, the qal verb form ba‘ar is understood to mean [...] "burn", whereas the pi`el form (present here) is understood to be not intensive as usual but causative. (The rule being that the pi'el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif'il.) Hence bi`er means [...] "kindle", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits only starting a fire on Shabbat.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike Rabbinic Jews, Karaites do not {{practice}} {{the ritual of}} lighting Shabbat candles. They have a differing interpretation of the Torah verse, [...] "You shall not [...] (Hebrew: bi‘er the pi‘el form of ba‘ar) a fire in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> dwellings {{on the day of}} Shabbat." [...] In Rabbinic Judaism, the qal verb form ba‘ar is understood to mean [...] "burn", whereas the pi‘el form (present here) is understood to be, not intensive as usual but causative, the rule being that the pi‘el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif‘il. Hence bi‘er means [...] "kindle", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits starting a fire on Shabbat. The vast majority of Karaite Jews hold that, throughout the Tanakh, ba‘ar explicitly means [...] "to burn", while the Hebrew word meaning [...] "to ignite" [...] or [...] "to kindle" [...] is hidliq. Accordingly, the mainstream in Karaite Judaism takes the passage to mean that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. However, the minority of Karaites who view the prohibition to be on kindling a fire often permit a fire to continue burning into the Sabbath.|$|E
