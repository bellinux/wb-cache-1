40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the physical and chemical parameters of Williams pear, stored at 25 ºC for 15 days, with and without edible coating. Edible coatings prepared with alginate 2 % and carrageenan 0. 5 % were tested. The analyses carried out on the samples were: weight loss, pH, soluble solids, firmness, and color. The edible coatings were characterized in terms of mechanical properties, permeability, thickness, and opacity. The results show that the application of edible coatings with carrageenan and alginate in pears influenced physical and chemical characteristics such as weight loss, pH, total soluble solids, color, and firmness of the fruit. However, the <b>alginate</b> <b>coating</b> showed the best results on pear conservation since it had lower water vapor permeability and greater tensile strength, and therefore it can be used as a protective film on these fruits...|$|E

In this work, this new delivery system was loaded with the recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and applied to mice by the intranasal route. Adjuvant effect of the delivery system was studied by measuring anti-HBsAg IgG in serum, anti-HBsAg sIgA in faeces extracts or nasal and vaginal secretions and interferon-[gamma] production in supernatants of the spleen cells. The mice were primed with 10  [mu]g of the vaccine associated or not with nanoparticles and associated or not with 10  [mu]g CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) followed by two sequential boosts at three week intervals. The association of HBsAg with the <b>alginate</b> <b>coated</b> chitosan nanoparticles, administered intranasally to the mice, gave rise to the humoral mucosal immune response. Humoral systemic immune response was not induced by the HBsAg loaded nanoparticles alone.

HBsAg loaded, <b>alginate</b> <b>coated</b> or uncoated chitosan nanoparticles, associated or not with CpGODN were subcutaneously administered to mice and several immunological parameters were evaluated. A high anti-HBsAg IgG titer (2271 ± 120 mIU/ml), {{with the majority of}} antibodies being of Th 2 type, was observed within group I, vaccinated with HBsAg loaded onto coated nanoparticles. However, regarding cellular immune response, no significant differences were observed for antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation or for the secretion of IFN-γ and IL- 4, when compared to the control group. The co-delivery of antigen-loaded nanoparticles {{in the presence of the}} immunopotentiator, CpG ODN 1826, resulted in an increase of anti-HBsAg IgG titers that was not statistically different from the first group; however, an increase of the IgG 2 a/IgG 1 ratio from 0. 1 to 1. 0 and an increase (p < 0. 01) of the IFN-γ production by the splenocytes stimulated with the HBV antigen was observed.

40|$|Abstract Background Absorption of antigens onto {{chitosan}} microparticles via {{electrostatic interaction}} {{is a common}} and relatively mild process suitable for mucosal vaccine. In order to increase the stability of antigens and prevent an immediate desorption of antigens from chitosan carriers in gastrointestinal tract, coating onto BSA loaded chitosan microparticles with sodium alginate was performed by layer-by-layer technology to meet the requirement of mucosal vaccine. Results The prepared alginate coated BSA loaded chitosan microparticles had loading efficiency (LE) of 60 % and loading capacity (LC) of 6 % with mean diameter of about 1 μm. When the weight ratio of alginate/chitosan microparticles was greater than 2, the stable system could be obtained. The rapid charge inversion of BSA loaded chitosan microparticles (from + 27 mv to - 27. 8 mv) was observed during the coating procedure which indicated the presence of alginate layer on the chitosan microparticles surfaces. According to the results obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the core-shell structure of BSA loaded chitosan microparticles was observed. Meanwhile, in vitro release study indicated that the initial burst release of BSA from alginate coated chitosan microparticles was lower than that observed from uncoated chitosan microparticles (40 % in 8 h vs. about 84 % in 0. 5 h). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) assay showed that <b>alginate</b> <b>coating</b> onto chitosan microparticles could effectively protect the BSA from degradation or hydrolysis in acidic condition for at least 2 h. The structural integrity of alginate modified chitosan microparticles incubated in PBS for 24 h was investigated by FTIR. Conclusion The prepared alginate coated chitosan microparticles, with mean diameter of about 1 μm, was suitable for oral mucosal vaccine. Moreover, <b>alginate</b> <b>coating</b> {{onto the surface of}} chitosan microparticles could modulate the release behavior of BSA from alginate coated chitosan microparticles and could effectively protect model protein (BSA) from degradation in acidic medium in vitro for at least 2 h. In all, the prepared alginate coated chitosan microparticles might be an effective vehicle for oral administration of antigens. </p...|$|E

The nanobullets were found to be the highly effective as they led to a 2. 26 fold (p < 0. 05) reduction at 24 h and a 4. 95 fold reduction (p ≤ 0. 001) in the spheroid size at 72 h. The tumour regression was 4 fold higher in mice fed on a nanobullet diet when compared to a control diet. The nanobullets were able to show a significantly high apoptotic (p ≤ 0. 0005) and necrotic index in the tumour cell population (p ≤ 0. 005) when compared to void NPs. Therefore, our nanoparticles have shown highly promising results and therefore deliver a new conduit towards the approach of cancer-targeted nanodelivery. This journal i...|$|R
40|$|Theuse of bone allografts is {{contraindicated}} in septic revision surgery due to {{the high}} risk of graft reinfection. Antibiotic release from the graft may solve the problem and these combinations can theoretically be used for prevention or even therapy of infection. The present study investigated whether amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin alone or in combination with chitosan or alginate are suitable for short-term or long-term bone coating. Human bone allografts were prepared from femoral head and lyophilized. Antibiotic coating was achieved by incubating the grafts in antibiotic solution and freeze-drying again. Two biopolymers chitosan and alginate were used for creating sustained-release implantable coatings and the drug release profile was characterized in vitro by spectrophotometry. Using lyophilization with or without chitosan only resulted in short-term release that lasted up to 48 hours. <b>Alginate</b> <b>coating</b> enabled a sustained release that lasted for 8 days with amoxicillin, 28 days with ciprofloxacin coating, and 50 days with vancomycin coating. Using only implantable biodegradable allograft and polymers, a sustained release of antibiotics was achieved with ciprofloxacin and vancomycin for several weeks. Since the calculated daily release of the antibiotic was lower than the recommended IV dose, the calcium alginate coated bone graft can support endoprosthesis revision surgery...|$|E
40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} {{was obtained}} through anther culture of Citrus reticulata, cv. Mandarino Tardivo di Ciaculli. The work {{was carried out}} to evaluate the response of somatic embryos inside a sodium <b>alginate</b> <b>coating</b> to different storage periods, and {{to the effects of}} the germicide PPM (1 ml l(- 1) stop) and the fungicide Thiophanate-methyl (100 mg l(- 1) stop). The effect of these alone or in combination, added to the artificial endosperm on the performance of the encapsulated somatic embryos was tested. After 45 days of culturing, sprouting, root development and conversion were recorded. The encapsulated somatic embryos can be conveniently stored at 4 degrees C, but not for a period longer than 60 days. The presence of Thiophanate-methyl in the artificial endosperm resulted in high levels of sprouting with promising frequencies of root development and conversion in to plantlets under invitro and ex vitro conditions. The concentration of PPM used, alone or in combination with the fungicide, showed some depressing effects in this regard. The prelimnary results obtained with the application of Thiophanate-methyl in a nutrient enriched alginate matrix are promising and warrant further experimentation in attempts to find a solution for the problems faced with ex vitro use of encapsulated somatic embryos...|$|E
30|$|In this study, batch {{adsorption}} experiments for the uptake of MB, MG, and MV from aqueous solutions {{have been}} carried out using low-cost different adsorbents—P and AP. Adsorption is found to depend on pH, adsorbent dose, and contact time. The initial pH solution has a marked influence on the MB, MG, and MV adsorption performance. Equilibrium adsorption data were correlated with modified Langmuir, Freundlich, Scatchard, D-R, and Temkin adsorption isotherm equations. Isotherm studies revealed that modified Langmuir model has well described the equilibrium data of MB, MG, and MV for P and AP. The maximum adsorption capacities (qm) calculated with the Langmuir isotherm model were 6.64 [*]mg/g-P/MB, 3.86 [*]mg/g-P/MG, and 4.97 [*]mg/g-P/MV and 104.1 [*]mg/g-AP/MB, 74.6 [*]mg/g-AP/MG, and 149.2 [*]mg/g-AP/MV. <b>Alginate</b> <b>coating</b> has shown great promise in improving the MB, MG, and MV adsorption capacity of perlite. The pH effect of adsorption of MB, MG, and MV on the P and AP was investigated, and the best pH for all adsorbent was 6. The adsorption equilibrium was reached at about 1 [*]h for AP. Kinetic data showed that the dynamic tendency of MB, MG, and MV adsorption could be defined by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the MB, MG, and MV dye adsorption with AP was spontaneous in nature. This study showed the high removal efficiency of AP for the removal of MB, MG, and MV from aqueous solutions.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to obtain microencapsulated probiotic cells {{in order to improve}} their resistance to heat stress and gastrointestinal conditions. A further aim was to obtain a potentially probiotic chocolate soufflé. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 cells were microencapsulated by spray drying in alginate matrix and further coated with chitosan. Bacterial survival after exposure to different heat treatments and simulated gastrointestinal conditions were measured to test the microcapsules. They were also dyed by using a LIVE/DEAD® BacLight™ Bacterial Viability Kit and characterized by epifluorescence microscope observation. Furthermore, a potentially chocolate soufflé was prepared using microencapsulated cells. The results indicated that alginate microcapsules did not improve acid tolerance or heat resistance in “in vitro” experiments, while they were able to protect 7 % of the Lactobacillus reuteri population during the baking of a chocolate soufflé, compared to a survival rate of 1 % of free cells. By contrast, the cells microencapsulated with <b>alginate</b> <b>coated</b> with chitosan showed, compared to free cells, improved acid tolerance, allowing the cell population to remain constant after 3 h in simulated gastric conditions. Moreover, the heat resistance of cells in co-cross-linked microcapsules significantly improved compared to free cells, both in “in vitro” and “in food” experiments. Microencapsulation led to a survival rate of 10 % after baking a chocolate soufflé. However, the final level of bacterial cells in the product was too low to consider the chocolate soufflé as a probiotic product...|$|R

An alginate solution (200 μg/mL) entrapping 2 nM of NGF (N 1408 from Sigma, reconstituted in a 0.1 % BSA solution in PBS) was casted on the CNT array and then crosslinked with a 30 % CaCl 2 solution as previously reported for drug release assessment. PC 12 cells were seeded on {{an ad hoc}} polystyrene substrate, fabricated with high precision milling machine, at a density of 50, 000 /cm 2. The substrate was thereafter placed on the CNT array system and the cells were grown in differentiating medium.|$|R
