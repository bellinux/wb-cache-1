David expresses his {{frustration}} at being thwarted when they were so close to wiping out the Darkness, but Mary Margaret reminds him {{that they would have}} chosen to save their loved ones in any situation, which Emma did. Merlin tells them that this was the darkest possible future he saw for Emma, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> their fight to destroy the Darkness had become much more difficult. Merlin sends Sir Lancelot to find his mother, the Lady of the Lake, as she can help them defeat the Darkness. Merlin heads back to the diner, while the others continue their search for Emma and Hook around the restaurant.|$|E

500|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál, the god Odin (disguised as Grímnir) reveals to {{the young}} Agnarr the {{existence}} of twelve locations. Odin mentions the location Þrymheimr sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the jötunn Þjazi once lived there, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> his daughter Skaði does. Odin describes Þrymheimr as consisting of [...] "ancient courts" [...] and refers to Skaði as [...] "the shining bride of the gods". In the prose introduction to the poem Skírnismál, the god Freyr has become heartsick for a fair girl (the jötunn Gerðr) he has spotted in Jötunheimr. The god Njörðr asks Freyr's servant Skírnir to talk to Freyr, {{and in the first}} stanza of the poem, Skaði also tells Skírnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset. Skírnir responds that he expects harsh words from their son Freyr.|$|E
500|$|Floyd's {{position}} was that Congress had allowed Missouri {{to become a}} sovereign state <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> its only choice was {{whether or not to}} admit it into the Union. Missouri came up again during the Presidential election of 1820. At issue was whether its electoral votes were valid, since it was still awaiting final approval of its constitution by the Congress. Floyd argued for counting its votes and the [...] "debate which followed precipitated one of the liveliest 'scenes' ever witnessed...". Disorder followed, and both Floyd and John Randolph were [...] "so persistent in their interruptions as to necessitate an adjournment of the joint session". A compromise was brought forward to count it as [...] "so many with the vote of Missouri and so many without it", but both Randolph and Floyd opposed this, which later prompted John Quincy Adams to describe their action as [...] "an effort to bring Missouri into the Union 'by storm.'" ...|$|E
500|$|West {{received}} similar {{approval from}} Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, {{both of whom}} contributed to the album.

Do I love the music that's out right now? I love it with a passion. Does it motivate me? Not one bit. That's because 808s & Heartbreak isn't out yet." [...] Despite the approval from the rap superstars, as well as the record-breaking chart performances of the first two singles, hip hop audiences remained indifferent towards the album, predicting it would flop. Responding to reviews, West stated that he didn't care about sales or getting good ratings, saying that it came from the heart and that's all that matters to him. When asked about the current state of hip hop, West compared it to a high school, stating that hip hop used to be all about being fearless and standing out, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> it is about being afraid and fitting in. Michael Jackson was an admirer of the album, with his daughter saying he played it for her [...] "all the time".|$|E

500|$|Like Delingpole, Andrew Blair found {{similarities}} between the Ninth Doctor era and the Third Doctor era, summarising Eccleston's single series as [...] "a modern day season seven". In his retrospective of the character, he states that Eccleston's casting proved that {{the revival of the}} show [...] "was not a light entertainment concern". He comments that in online fandom there was a sense [...] "of a ship being steered in a different direction" [...] and praises the plot device of the Time War as allowing the character to become mysterious again by providing him a [...] "blank slate". He compares the Ninth Doctor to the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in that both characters are [...] "an unknown who remains aggressively weird until his new-found human friends soften him up". Blair also felt that the Ninth Doctor's relationship with the Doctor's arch enemies the Daleks was more successful than in other incarnations giving particular praise to Eccleston's [...] "spittle-enhanced and terrifyingly furious reaction" [...] to the monsters in [...] "Dalek". Blair ends his retrospective by noting that without the foundations laid by Eccleston the show [...] "wouldn't have been able to move onwards towards the even more popular David Tennant era". Steven Moffat, who wrote [...] "The Empty Child"/"The Doctor Dances" [...] for Eccleston's Doctor and would become Doctor Who executive producer in 2010, observed that in 2005 there was a distinct lack of science fiction and fantasy drama in the UK. He felt that the first series had to establish itself as [...] "a bit Hollyoaks" [...] and [...] "a bit tough detective" [...] to prove itself as a [...] "proper, sensible drama series". Moffat notes that the 2005 series [...] "changed the landscape into which it once tried to fit" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> Doctor Who [...] "has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Note su la peinture of {{the same}} year Metzinger argues that Delaunay's Tour Eiffel {{combines}} several different views captured throughout the day in one image. 'Intuitive, Delaunay has defined intuition as the brusque deflagration of all the reasonings accumulated each day'. The following year, in Cubisme et Tradition (1911) Metzinger writes of the immobility of paintings of the past, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now,</b> artists permit themselves the liberty of 'moving around the object to give, under the control of intelligence, a concrete representation derived from several successive aspects.' He continues, 'The painting possesses space, and now it also reigns in the duration' [...], With motion and time, intuition and consciousness, Metzinger could now claim his art had moved closer to nature, closer to a true, yet subjective, reality.|$|E
2500|$|Jagow's {{belief that}} the summer of 1914 was {{the best time for}} Germany to go to war was widely shared in the German government.

The Chief of the German General Staff, Moltke, told Count Lerchenfeld, the Bavarian Minister in Berlin, that [...] "a moment so favourable from the military point of view might never occur again". Moltke argued that due to the alleged superiority of German weaponry and training, combined with the recent change in the French Army from a two-year to a three-year period of service, Germany could easily defeat both France and Russia in 1914.|$|E

2500|$|On 11 August 1939, Ribbentrop met the Italian Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Count Bernardo Attolico, in Salzburg. During that meeting, both Ciano and Attolico were {{horrified to}} learn from Ribbentrop that Germany planned to attack Poland that summer, and that the Danzig issue was just a pretext for aggression. When Ciano {{asked if there was}} {{anything}} Italy could do to broker a Polish-German settlement that would avert a war, he was told by Ribbentrop that [...] "We want war!". Ribbentrop expressed his firmly held belief that neither Britain nor France would go to war for Poland, but if that should occur, he fully expected the Italians to honour the terms of the Pact of Steel (which was both an offensive and defensive treaty) and declare war not only on Poland, but on the Western powers if necessary. Ribbentrop told his Italian guests that [...] "the localization of the conflict is certain" [...] and [...] "the probability of victory is infinite". Ribbentrop brushed away Ciano's fears of a general war. He claimed that [...] "France and England cannot intervene because they are insufficiently prepared militarily and because they have no means of injuring Germany". Ciano complained furiously that Ribbentrop had violated his promise given only that spring, when Italy signed the Pact of Steel, {{that there would be no}} war for the next three years. Ciano said that it was absurd to believe that the Reich could attack Poland without triggering a wider war <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> the Italians were left with the choice of either going to war when they needed three more years to rearm or being forced into the humiliation of having to violate the terms of the Pact of Steel by declaring neutrality (which would make the Italians appear cowardly). Ciano complained in his diary that his arguments [...] "had no effect" [...] on Ribbentrop, who simply refused to believe any information that did not fit in with his preconceived notions. Despite Ciano's efforts to persuade Ribbentrop to put off the attack on Poland until 1942, so as to allow the Italians time to get ready for war, Ribbentrop was adamant that Germany had no interest in a diplomatic solution of the Danzig question and only wanted a war to wipe Poland off the map. The Salzburg meeting marked the moment when Ciano's dislike of Ribbentrop was transformed into outright hatred, and of the beginning of his disillusionment with the pro-German foreign policy that he had championed up to that time.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Ebersol (as Mr. Fix) {{appears in}} , voiced by Donny Lucas. He {{is a genius}} {{inventor}} and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the Maggia. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode “Whiplash”, Mr. Fix orders Whiplash to kill Pepper Potts’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); then, Mr. Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, Iron Man defeats him. In the episode “Man and Iron Man”, Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode [...] "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate Unicorn and Killer Shrike upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode [...] "Look Into the Light" [...] Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode [...] "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the Titanium Man armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet {{found a way to}} properly bond titanium to vibranium following his first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. Fix that his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> he can work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode [...] "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the Titanium Man armor. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 {{to find a way to}} make it work or he will destroy him. In the episode [...] "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that War Machine is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode [...] "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on Count Nefaria. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.|$|E
