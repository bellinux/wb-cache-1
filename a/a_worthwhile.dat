5|$|Barrett {{presented}} Xem as his Aeonic Word to the Setians, presenting it as {{a natural}} and necessary further development of Aquino's Xeper. Aquino later acknowledged Xem as <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its exclusivity as incompatible with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Gerlachovský štít shares its geology {{and ecology}} {{with the rest}} of the High Tatras, but {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> environment for biologists as the highest ground anywhere in Europe north of the parallel linking approximately Munich, Salzburg, and Vienna. With the travel restrictions imposed by the Eastern Bloc, the mountain was particularly treasured as the loftiest point available to climb to by Czechs, East Germans, Hungarians, Poles, and Slovaks. It continues to attract its share of visitors although the local authorities have been continually adding new restrictions on access.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E

50|$|The double-act of Šlitr and Suchý made film appearances, firstly in Bylo nás deset (There Were Ten Of Us, 1963) {{and later}} in the {{successful}} musical comedy Kdyby 1000 klarinetů (If a Thousand Clarinets, 1964). In 1965 Šlitr composed the jazz opera Dobře placená procházka (<b>A</b> Walk <b>Worthwhile),</b> which was staged in 2007 by the Czech-American director Miloš Forman at the National Theatre in Prague. Šlitr's attempt to stage <b>A</b> Walk <b>Worthwhile</b> on Broadway was unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|Magnitude Squared Coherence is {{a signal}} {{processing}} tool that indicates how well two time domain signals match {{one with the}} other by tracking linear dependencies in their spectral decomposition. SCAN was the first way {{to use it as}} a SCA. This paper introduces two ways of using the Magnitude Squared Coherence in Side Channel Analysis. The first way is {{to use it as a}} distinguisher while the second consists in using it to transform the side channel traces in <b>an</b> <b>worthwhile</b> manner. Additionally, <b>an</b> algorithm for fast computation of the SCAN is provided...|$|R
5|$|The Dallachy Wing was {{on alert}} to attack any ships {{found by the}} {{reconnaissance}} patrol. Although the group of five merchant ships were highly vulnerable to attack and <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> target, Coastal Command came under the operational command of the Admiralty and was bound by its decision to give higher priority to attacking warships than merchant vessels. As a result, the wing was dispatched against Z33 even though the destroyer and its escorts were well protected and {{in a difficult position}} for aircraft to attack.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> improvement on the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
25|$|Software {{functional}} quality reflects {{how well}} it complies with or conforms to a given design, based on functional requirements or specifications. That attribute can also {{be described as the}} fitness for purpose of a piece of software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> product. It {{is the degree to which}} the correct software was produced.|$|E
25|$|Although Emanuel opposes legalized euthanasia, he {{believes}} that after age 75 life is not worth living, {{and the pursuit of}} longevity, not <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> goal for U.S. health care policy. This is refuted by neurosurgeon and medical ethicist Miguel Faria, who in two articles in Surgical Neurology International claims that healthy lifestyles and brain plasticity can lead to the postponement of senescence and lead to happiness even as we age.|$|E
50|$|There is {{considerable}} argument {{within the industry}} whether the small difference in yearly collection between single and dual-axis trackers makes the added complexity of <b>a</b> two-axis tracker <b>worthwhile.</b> <b>A</b> recent review of actual production statistics from southern Ontario suggested the difference was about 4% in total, which was {{far less than the}} added costs of the dual-axis systems. This compares unfavourably with the 24-32% improvement between a fixed-array and single-axis tracker.|$|R
50|$|Although Valença {{has been}} {{virtually}} ignored by its government, its people, affordable lodging and land, decent basic infrastructure and {{proximity to the}} most beautiful beaches and cities in Bahia (Salvador, Morro de São Paulo, Gamboa, Boipeba, Itaparica, etc.) make it <b>a</b> very <b>worthwhile</b> holiday location.|$|R
5000|$|On top of {{the hammer}} price, {{you will have to}} pay a small charge for {{indemnity}} insurance. This is <b>an</b> extremely <b>worthwhile</b> fee that assures that you have [...] "good title" [...] to the car. This indemnity normally costs only small percentage of the hammer price.|$|R
25|$|The Terrorists of Iraq {{discusses}} the Obama Administration Iranian nuclear development limitations agreement, and calls it <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> endeavor. Nance {{argues that the}} deal {{is in the best}} interests of Iran, for its people desire Western culture and capitalist products including fashion, automobiles and U.S. manufacturing products. He points out the nuclear deal would yield such benefits for Iran and that is why it is in the interests of its citizens to succeed.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} on Colchis became the Roman {{province}} of Lazicum, with Emperor Nero later incorporating it into the Province of Pontus in 63 AD, and successively in Cappadocia by Domitian in 81 AD. At the same time, Iberia {{continued to be a}} vassal state because it enjoyed significant independence and with the lowlands frequently raided by fierce mountain tribes, paying a nominal homage to Rome in exchange of protection was viewed as <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> investment.|$|E
25|$|Like the Ruwer region, {{wine from}} the Saar {{district}} (along the lower {{course of the}} Saar River, in Rhineland-Palatinate) is particularly dependent on {{the overall quality of}} the vintage typically only 4 years out of every 10 producing <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> set of wines. The wines that do come out of these warm vintages are noted for their apple-like freshness and steely mineral notes. The most ideal vintages allow harvest to take place between late October and mid November when the grapes can develop enough sugar to produce floral and honeyed notes.|$|E
40|$|An {{educational}} program helped non-farmers better understand agriculture through presentations and farm tours.

I had {{not heard}} the Timișoara Philharmonic Orchestra before, nor Jean-François Antonioli as a {{conductor}} (he has a fine reputation as a pianist). They are first-class, and he has an acute ear for Busonis orchestral sonority. The recording is rich and colourful." ...|$|R
50|$|Well I got {{affiliated}} with an organisation long after I was {{established as a}} critic of psychiatry, called Citizens Commission for Human Rights, because they were then the only organisation and they still are the only organisation who had money and had some access to lawyers and were active in trying to free mental patients who were incarcerated in mental hospitals with whom there was nothing wrong, who had committed no crimes, who {{wanted to get out}} of the hospital. And that to me was <b>a</b> very <b>worthwhile</b> cause; it's still <b>a</b> very <b>worthwhile</b> cause. I no more believe in their religion or their beliefs than I believe in the beliefs of any other religion. I am an atheist, I don't believe in Christianity, in Judaism, in Islam, in Buddhism and I don't believe in Scientology. I have nothing to do with Scientology.|$|R
25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
25|$|By 1978, {{the study}} phase of {{development}} was completed. The McDonnell Douglas/Sperry team had examined {{the use of}} the British Aerospace Sea Wolf missile, which failed to meet the full specification, but was the only existing missile that approached the SIRCS requirements. Sea Wolf was anticipated to be able to enter service in 1979 if selected as <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> basis for the further development; a newly designed missile would push the expected in-service date to 1983. However, the United States Congress refused to allocate funding for the further development of the RIM-113 missile. A proposal was made for joint development of SIRCS with the U.S. Air Force's AMRAAM project;, but this came to naught, and the RIM-113 was cancelled in 1979.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, a {{movement}} pushing for Alaska statehood began, but in the contiguous 48 states, legislators were worried that Alaska's population was too sparse, distant, and isolated, and its economy was too unstable for it to be <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> addition to the United States. World War II and the Japanese invasion highlighted Alaska's strategic importance, and the issue of statehood was taken more seriously, but it was the discovery of oil at Swanson River on the Kenai Peninsula that dispelled the image of Alaska as a weak, dependent region. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Act into United States law on July 4, 1958, which paved the way for Alaska's admission into the Union on January 3, 1959. Juneau, the territorial capital, continued as state capital, and William A. Egan was sworn in as the first governor.|$|E

25|$|On 18 January, the High {{court ruled}} {{in favour of}} the City of London Corporation, giving them the power to order the {{eviction}} of occupiers from the St Pauls Camp. A spokesperson for the City {{said they would not}} further pursue eviction until 20 January, to give occupiers a chance to appeal against the ruling. The appeal date was later set to 13 February 2012. Comparing the St Pauls camp as it was in January 2012 with its first few weeks, journalists such as Sid Ryan, Brendan O'Neill and Laurie Penny noted a change of character, with energy being diverted from political activism into caring for homeless and mentally ill people attracted by the companionship and shelter. Ryan has argued that despite caring for the homeless being <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> cause, it may help the movement achieve change in the wider world if the camp is evicted.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take My Favorite Husband to {{television}} with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw {{a television show}} as {{a great opportunity to}} work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.|$|E
25|$|After both Friday {{practice}} sessions, the FIA {{tested for}} the first time a new system called the Virtual Safery Car, which is in response to minimising the risk of serious accidents and injuries, such as those suffered by Jules Bianchi at the Japanese Grand Prix. Its aim is to force drivers to reduce their speed by about 35% in an accident zone, with the aid of a dashboard display. Drivers have agreed it is <b>a</b> <b>worthwhile</b> system that, however, requires refinement for further testing at subsequent Grands Prix before introduction in 2015. Caterham and Marussia were each granted permission by the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone to miss the Grand Prix after both teams were afflicted with long-term financial problems and placed into administration. This was the smallest field entered into a Formula One motor race since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix. There were two driver changes for the first free practice session. European Formula Three Championship third-place finisher Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne for the second time this season, and Williams reserve driver Felipe Nasr drove Bottas's car.|$|E
