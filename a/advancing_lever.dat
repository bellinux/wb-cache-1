5000|$|... a different, angled film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> {{as well as}} {{slightly}} different rewind, self-timer and frame selection levers ...|$|R
5000|$|Rapid-wind film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Earlier 35 mm SLRs, {{with the}} sole {{exception}} of Exakta's left-handed lever, had knob winders.|$|R
50|$|The Tenax was {{modified}} in 1953 with a fixed viewfinder integrated {{in a higher}} top plate with the exposure counter inside it, and a revised <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Soon after it was renamed Taxona, because the East German company had lost the rights to use the traditional Zeiss Ikon names, property of the Western Zeiss Ikon company. At the same time, the Novar name became Novonar. The tip of the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> became black in 1954. Production ended in 1959.|$|R
50|$|The rewind {{release was}} {{moved from the}} front right {{faceplate}} {{to the top of}} the camera between the ASA setting dial and the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> arm.|$|R
5000|$|FED 2e is a FED 3b {{with the}} FED 2d shutter {{that does not}} have the slow speeds. Similar to the 3b, it does not have strap lugs but has a film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> Production ended around 1970.|$|R
5000|$|The Neoca 2S is a 35mm {{rangefinder}} camera made in Japan in 1955 and 1956. It has a dual-stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> and {{a central}} shutter; neither feature is typical {{for this kind}} of camera. The lens is a Neokor anastigmat f=45mm/3.5.|$|R
50|$|The Exakta 66 {{is based}} on the Pentacon Six but was made in West Germany by Exakta GmbH, Nuremberg. The body is rubber coated, the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> moves through a shorter angle, and it has a TTL-metered prism coupled to new Schneider lenses.|$|R
50|$|The OM-1n {{is similar}} to the OM-1MD, with a {{redesigned}} film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> a flash ready/sufficient flash LED in the viewfinder, and automatic flash synchronization (X-sync), regardless of the position of the FP/X switch when used with a T-series flash unit mounted on Flash Shoe 4.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F-301 {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first Nikon SLR sold that lacked a film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> As a result the {{selector}} knob, also used to lock the shutter button, has a continuous option {{in addition to the}} single shot. It was also the first Nikon SLR to feature DX film decoding.|$|R
40|$|Nikon FM compact has {{simplification}} feature {{derived from}} cameras designed for easy, yet accurate {{use in a}} weightless environment. Innovation is a plastic-cushioned <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which <b>advances</b> the film and simultaneously switches on a built in light meter. With a turn of the lens aperture ring, a glowing signal in viewfinder confirms correct exposure...|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{offers the}} {{convenience}} of image composition with wide open aperture. The aperture is stopped down to the selected value after the shutter is released. After exposure the mirror stays up until the bottom-mounted single-stroke film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> is again wound. Focusing is via a ground glass screen with a central split-image rangefinder.|$|R
5000|$|This {{redesign}} {{made a new}} {{camera case}} design necessary, leaving additional space for the frame counter, and the frame reset slider. The Retina Reflex cases were already something special before since the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> (Reflex) and aperture/shutter setting wheel (Reflex S) are located on the bottom. The photo shows just how complex the Retina case had become.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the typical}} big finder of the Optima series, {{but on this}} special model it is {{combined}} with a superimposed coupled rangefinder. Shutter speed is controlled electronically by a CdS meter, with speeds from 15 sec. to 1/1000 sec. A special feature of the series is the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> which can be switched to also rewind the film at its end.|$|R
5000|$|The camera's {{top plate}} has the {{manually}} set frame counter, the shutter release, the {{film rewind knob}} with film reminder dial, the exposure needle window, meter adjustment knob with EV and ASA/DIN scales, the film (advance) release button, the frame (counter) advance slider, and the accessory shoe. The bottom plate contains the tripod socket, the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> the back release latch, and the film rewind release button.|$|R
50|$|The Zorki 4, 1956, was a Zorki 3S with {{self-timer}} added. The Zorki 4K {{was identical}} but used an <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> {{instead of the}} old-style wind knob. With over 2 million units produced, the Zorki 4 was the most successful Zorki and {{has a reputation as}} one of the best Russian cameras, although the self-timer and slow shutter speeds were unreliable. The Zorki Mir of 1959 was a lower-cost Zorki 4 with fewer shutter speeds.|$|R
50|$|Leica IIIf and its {{predecessors}} {{had used a}} knob to advance the film. For fear of tearing the film, early M3s had a double stroke <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> like the Neoca 2s would. Later models (from model no 915 251) had single-stroke levers, which quickened up operation of the camera. Another type of variation is in the film pressure plate used. Early models used a glass plate to keep the film flat; later models used a metal plate.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The first rigid {{model of}} Retinette (Model 022) {{introduced}} in 1954. Lens is Scheider Kreuznach Reomar and the shutter is Compur - Rapid. Leather carrying case was {{included with the}} camera. A 29.5 mm skylight filter {{is attached to the}} lens. The lever on the left of the lens at 9 o' clock is the self-timer actuator. Construction of the body is all-metal, including the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> at the bottom. The lens mounting plate is rectangular ...|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter thread size of 40.5mm.|$|R
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|R
50|$|The Leica MP is Leica's {{latest film}} {{rangefinder}} camera. Unlike the preceding Leica M7, the camera has adopted many retro design features {{from the earlier}} M3. These include a M3 type metal film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> knob film rewind design and M3 type frameline adjust lever. The basic classic design remains unchanged and the design for loading film from the bottom has been retained. The camera comes in various camera finishes including black chrome, black paint and silver chrome and can be further customised with Leica AG's Ã  la carte program.|$|R
50|$|The Leicaflex SL Mot was {{a variant}} of the Leicaflex SL that could take a motor drive, and lacked the {{self-timer}} and the meter switch in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The SL Mot was mostly produced in black enamel and later black chrome, but chrome examples do exist. The motor drive was as large as the camera body itself, marked LEICAFLEX MOTOR, and was probably only made in black. 980 serial numbers were allotted to the Leicaflex SL Mot. It seems that some were used by the NASA and have NASA engravings.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, the FTb {{design was}} revised slightly. The camera {{was given a}} plastic tipped film <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> The stop down lever was changed to the same style as that found on the F-1. The PC sync socket was given a {{spring-loaded}} plastic cover. The ring around {{the outer edge of}} the shutter speed dial was changed from a scalloped design to a diamond textured design. Finally, a shutter speed display was added in the lower left hand corner of the viewfinder. This model was unofficially known as FTb-N or FTbn.|$|R
50|$|Much work {{went into}} human factors {{engineering}} {{to create an}} ergonomic user interface for the camera. The form of previous cameras was largely dictated by the required locations of mechanical controls on the body, such as the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> rewind crank, shutter speed dial, shutter release, etc. On the T90, the film transport control is no longer required, while the others are no longer mechanically linked. This gave the designers more freedom to shape the camera {{to make it easier}} to control and hold, and to place controls in a way that suited the user rather than a mechanical design.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Leicaflex {{is readily}} identifiable from its CdS meter window and battery cover {{on the front}} of the prism housing just above the lens. It was offered in chrome and black enamel finishes, the latter being rare. The first series had a fan-shaped exposure counter window and a tripod socket attached by three screws, whereas the second series had a round exposure counter window, a tripod socket integrated in the bottom plate and a meter switch built in the <b>advance</b> <b>lever.</b> In use, the two series are virtually identical. 32,500 serial numbers were allotted to the original Leicaflex.|$|R
50|$|Film {{transport}} in the T80 {{is completely}} automatic, {{just as in}} the T70, in both directions. This leaves the top of the camera very clean, since there is no <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> or rewind knob. Film loading is automatic; the user only has to align the film leader with an orange mark and close the back, and the camera loads and advances the film automatically. Indicators on the top LCD display the status of loading, winding and rewinding. The motor, and the camera's other functions including the focusing motor in the lens, are powered by 4 AAA batteries housed in the base of the camera.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} 30 years {{the vast majority}} of SLRs standardized the layout of the controls. The film was transported from left to right, so the rewind crank was on the left, followed in order by the pentaprism, shutter speed dial, shutter release and the film <b>advance</b> <b>lever,</b> which in some cameras was ratcheted so that multiple strokes could be used to advance the film. Some cameras, such as Nikon's Nikkormat FT cameras (marketed under the brand-name 'Nikormat' in European countries and elsewhere) and some models of Olympus OM series, deviated from this layout by placing the shutter speed control as a ring around the lens mount.|$|R
50|$|Changes to the <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> angle from a tipped {{out to a}} curled {{inward and}} the trim shroud at back of the finder bay had a {{matching}} scallop for the new lever design to rest upon, this appeared about late 1972. As well were changes to the spool release mechanism, where it was an improvement from a checkered friction operated surface to a more convenient flip handled method and the center posts that held the film spools lost their angled profile for a more controversial straighter angle that improved film feed accuracy, but caused some difficulty in speed of spool placement during film reloading and also to prompted some to seek services to custom grind the posts.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in late 1985, the Super was {{identical}} in basic {{shape and size}} to the previous model and accepted the same lenses. Many improvements and changes were included to make this model arguably a better camera than the previous Auto 110. Film winding was improved with a single-stroke film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> that <b>advanced</b> the film and cocked the shutter in one winding (the Auto 110 took two strokes to advance the film). A switch around the shutter release button enabled a new ten-second self-timer mode and a shutter lock; the self-timer activated a red light on the pentaprism housing, which flashed during the 10-second shutter release count-down. A button on the front on the user's left hand side gave a +1.5 EV (exposure value) backlit scene exposure compensation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{photograph}} above {{shows the}} external flash connection socket {{in the upper}} right corner. The red lever selects among M, F, and X flash synchronizations. The shutter button is barely visible over the letter [...] "h" [...] of [...] "Ricoh." [...] The two large knobs are designed to let the user's two index fingers rapidly focus the camera while following basketball players or other rapidly moving subjects. The wired mount for an external flash unit {{is shown in the}} center of the top view of the camera. The rapid film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> shown in the bottom view pivots on its right end and is pulled by the extension (shown folded out of the way) near the lens barrel. The bottom view also shows a reminder ring for noting the speed of the film currently in use.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|R
50|$|The Asahi Optical Company took a {{different}} manufacturing path, inspired by the German SLRs. Its first model, the Asahiflex I, existed in prototype form in 1951 and production in 1952, making it the first Japanese-built 35mm SLR. The Asahiflex IIB of 1954 was the first Japanese SLR with an instant-return mirror. Previously, the mirror would remain up and the viewfinder black until the shutter was cocked for the next shot. In 1957, the Asahi Pentax became the first Japanese fixed-pentaprism SLR; its success led Asahi to eventually rename itself Pentax. This was the first SLR to use the right-hand single-stroke film <b>advance</b> <b>lever</b> of the Leica M3 of 1954 and Nikon S2 of 1955. Asahi (starting with the Asahi Pentax) and many other camera makers used the M42 lens mount from the Contax S, which {{came to be called}} the Pentax screw mount. Pentax is now part of the Ricoh Corporation.|$|R
