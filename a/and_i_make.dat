He shot {{a commercial for}} Rock the Vote and, along with his sister, visited the University of Southern California {{to encourage students to}} vote during the 2004 U.S. election. He also campaigned for Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. He has said, however, that [...] "it frustrates me when actors talk politics; I'm political <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> choices in my movies that I think are political. I try and say things with what I do. Rightly or wrongly, young actors have all the power." [...] In an interview for Rendition, he remarked that [...] "it's a sad time when actors are politicians and politicians are actors".|$|E
500|$|The Allied naval commanders were {{disappointed}} {{by the failure of}} the 26 submarines directed against the Completion Force to inflict any damage on the ships. Fife concluded that this was due to the Completion Force's high speed, the poor weather conditions {{at the time of the}} operation and the Japanese ships being fitted with equipment that enabled them to detect submarines' radar signals. In a letter to Lockwood, he wrote that the failure of the submarines under his command [...] "was a bitter pill to take <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> no alibi". [...] Lockwood attributed the decision to deploy his submarines too far to the west on faulty intelligence, and told Fife that [...] "our dope certainly went sour at the last moment. Perhaps I depended too much on it".|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the album's urban {{contemporary}}-oriented songs in the adult contemporary market allowed {{for the success of}} other artists while Stefani was pregnant and later recording The Sweet Escape. Nelly Furtado's third album Loose was released in June 2006 and was primarily produced by and written with hip hop producers Timbaland and Danja. Furtado's reinvention from a worldbeat singer-songwriter was to Stefani's previous forays into urban contemporary music. In his review of Loose, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated that Timbaland aimed to [...] "produce an omnipop multiformat blockbuster in the style of —but without Gwen." [...] The Black Eyed Peas member Fergie released her solo debut album The Dutchess in September 2006. The cholas that accompanied Fergie in some of her music videos were viewed as derivatives of the Harajuku Girls and Stefani's [...] "Luxurious" [...] music video. The album's lead single [...] "London Bridge" [...] was paralleled to [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] and the third single [...] "Glamorous" [...] to [...] "Luxurious". Fergie refuted accusations of piggybacking on Stefani's music, stating that [...] "this is all so ridiculous [...] The Peas <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> music we love, and for others to speculate is their problem." ...|$|E
500|$|Tong's {{character}} Chao {{has drawn}} mixed reception, often being mistaken {{as a real}} person. As a result for posting racist content, the account had been previously suspended {{for a period of}} fourteen days after showing a video deemed to mock African-Americans. Gabriella Nomura of The Vancouver Sun has branded Chao as [...] "a breath of politically incorrect fresh air", while Kevin Tang of Amped Asia has called him [...] "racist, sexist, vulgar, and self-deprecating" [...] but also [...] "one of the most funny Youtube celebrities". a-Tunes.net said that Chao's blackface performance, a mockery of African American people, had [...] "crossed the line". However, viewership has been positive. The [...] "Canton Style" [...] music video– a parody of Korean singer-rapper Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style"– amassed 1.1 million views within three days of its uploading. Another of Tong's uploads, [...] "Chinese Guy Eats Sooo Loud!" [...] has close to 2 million hits. His videos are, as of 2011, the number one and two most watched in Canada. Tong has said, in response to audience comments that his performances are [...] "racist", that everything is [...] "done for comedy. I'm not really racist against anybody. I take stereotypes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> them outlandish so everybody can laugh." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E

500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pehl, Corbett, and Murphy cameo on the revival, reprising {{their roles}} as Pearl, Brain Guy, and Professor Bobo, respectively. Hodgson opened up to the show {{any of the other}} cast members to make cameo {{appearances}} or aid in the creative process. However, Nelson, Weinstein, and Beaulieu stated {{that they would not be}} involved with the MST3K revival; Nelson said, [...] "The brand does not belong to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> and have made (almost) zero dollars off it since it stopped production in 1999."

2500|$|The {{subject was}} {{addressed}} again in 1994, when the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration examined {{changes to the}} Citizenship Act. Several witnesses presented divergent views on the oath: some argued that the present form should be retained, while others {{expressed a desire to}} see the name of the country given prominence, though not necessarily with the absence of mention of the sovereign. The committee recommended a new citizenship oath: I pledge full allegiance to Canada and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, and swear to faithfully obey the laws and fulfill my duties as a citizen. Sergio Marchi, then minister of Citizenship and Immigration, proposed a further step of creating a new [...] "declaration" [...] of citizenship, and commissioned ten Canadian writers to compose a pledge, with the explicit instruction to not refer to the monarch of Canada; the suggested declaration decided on was: I am a citizen of Canada, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> this commitment: to uphold our laws and freedoms; to respect our people in their diversity; to work for our common well-being; and to safeguard and honour this ancient northern land. Marchi was told by then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to abandon the project.|$|E
