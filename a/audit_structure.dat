40|$|The UK National Health Service (NI-IS) has {{undergone}} massive reform {{over the last}} ten years. Many of the changes have been connected {{with the introduction of}} business and management concepts into a public service. Part of this process has been the introduction of the principles of quality improvement through the process of Clinical Audit. This thesis proposes that the practice of Clinical Audit is often not resulting in an improvement in the quality of patient care. It suggests that this is due to many audit projects not completing the audit cycle. This failure to complete the audit cycle is attributed to the lack of completeness in many audit approaches and to human failure to actually carry out recommended changes in practice unless there is a mechanism to check that such changes occur. In an effort to address these issues, a conceptual model for a structured method has been evaluated and tested on both historical and live audit projects. The method has been developed into a full audit approach (Clinical <b>Audit</b> <b>Structured</b> Method; CASM) encompassing all four stages of Deming's Process Improvement Cycle. However, some deficiencies have been identified with this method and it has been proposed that a computerised toolset (Clinical <b>Audit</b> <b>Structured</b> Toolset; CAST) be developed in order to address these issues. A conceptual model of such a toolset has been suggested and possible barriers to its development have been identified. In conclusion, an information based method has been developed for clinical audit in the NHS and the rationale behind its conception has been discussed and supported. The method itself has been tested and the author has supported the supposition that by improving the information management aspects of audit practice, audit practice could be improved thus resulting in an improvement in patient care...|$|R

40|$|International audienceQuality of {{healthcare}} {{is a hot}} topic and {{this is especially true}} for cancer care. New surgical techniques and effective neoadjuvant treatment regimens have significantly improved colorectal cancer outcome. Nevertheless, there seem to be substantial differences in quality of care between European countries, hospitals and doctors. To reduce hospital variation, most initiatives aim on selective referral, encouraging patients to seek care in high-volume hospitals, where cancer care is concentrated to site-specialist multidisciplinary teams. As an alternative to volume-based referral, hospitals and surgeons can also improve their results by learning from their own outcome statistics and those from colleagues treating a similar patient group. European national audit registries in surgical oncology have led to improvements with a greater impact on survival than any of the adjuvant therapies currently under study. Moreover, they offer the possibility to perform research on patient groups that are usually excluded from clinical trials. Nevertheless, between European countries remain differences in outcome and treatment schedules that cannot be easily explained. The European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) has recognised these importances and created the Registration of Cancer Care(EURECCA) framework to develop a European colorectal <b>audit</b> <b>structure.</b> EURECCA will advance future treatment improvements and spread these to all European cancer patients.
