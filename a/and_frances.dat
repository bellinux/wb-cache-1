5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison <b>and</b> <b>Frances</b> Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
