25|$|Therefore, {{we receive}} {{knowledge}} from sensible things. But since sensible {{things are not}} actually intelligible, {{in addition to the}} intellect, which formally understands, an <b>active</b> <b>power</b> must be acknowledged in the soul, which power abstracts intelligible likeness or species from sense images in the imagination.|$|E

25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, apparent power can {{be calculated}} from this. For <b>active</b> <b>power</b> it would at first appear {{that we would have}} to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, if we look at one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} power that, {{averaged}} over a complete {{cycle of the}} AC waveform, results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as <b>active</b> <b>power</b> (more commonly called real power to avoid ambiguity especially in discussions of loads with non-sinusoidal currents). The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known as reactive power.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the time}} average of a {{function}} of the form cos(ωt+k) is zero provided that ω is nonzero. Therefore, the only product terms that have a nonzero average are those where the frequency of voltage and current match. In other words, it is possible to calculate active (average) power by simply treating each frequency separately and adding up the answers. Furthermore, if we assume the voltage of the mains supply is a single frequency (which it usually is), this shows that harmonic currents are a bad thing. They will increase the rms current (since there will be non-zero terms added) and therefore apparent power, but they will have no effect on the <b>active</b> <b>power</b> transferred. Hence, harmonic currents will reduce the power factor. Harmonic currents can be reduced by a filter placed at the input of the device. Typically this will consist of either just a capacitor (relying on parasitic resistance and inductance in the supply) or a capacitor-inductor network. An <b>active</b> <b>power</b> factor correction circuit at the input would generally reduce the harmonic currents further and maintain the power factor closer to unity.|$|E
40|$|Development {{of active}} {{systems in the}} field of {{prostheses}} and orthotics is currently one of the main topics in medical rehab research. As in this field different researcher from different disciplines, not only from technical areas like informatics, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering, but also from medical and biological research do have to work together, there is a strong need for an integrative development procedure. In this paper a systematic and methodical approach for the development of active systems {{in the field of}} Prosthetics and Orthotics is presented. Two examples of <b>active</b> <b>powered</b> devices in this field are shown. One is an <b>active</b> <b>powered</b> knee prosthesis. The other one is an <b>active</b> <b>powered</b> arm orthosis.

Current Energy Star guidelines for computers call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of rated output in the PC's power supply.

25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant reactor safety concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no <b>active</b> <b>power,</b> though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the seventeenth century, René Descartes (1596–1650) began to develop a more modern, materialistic concept of the conatus, {{describing}} it as [...] "an <b>active</b> <b>power</b> or tendency of bodies to move, expressing the power of God". Whereas the ancients used the term in a strictly anthropomorphic sense similar to voluntary [...] "endeavoring" [...] or [...] "struggling" [...] to achieve certain ends, and medieval Scholastic philosophers developed a notion of conatus as a mysterious intrinsic property of things, Descartes uses the term in a somewhat more mechanistic sense. More specifically, for Descartes, in contrast to Buridan, movement and stasis are two states of the same thing, not different things. Although there is much ambiguity in Descartes' notion of conatus, one can see here the beginnings of a move away from the attribution of desires and intentions to nature and its workings toward a more scientific and modern view.|$|E

500|$|Saints were {{believed}} to have an <b>active</b> <b>power</b> after death, and the reformers made great efforts to transfer saints' remains and relics from obscure minsters to their own new establishments.

Gifts of land and other possessions to a church were often expressed as donations to its principal saint, so the seizure of such a saint's remains from an unreformed community could then justify the transfer of its wealth to a Benedictine monastery, {{on the ground that}} as property had been donated to the saint, it should follow his or her body to its new home. The reformers had what Alan Thacker calls a [...] "mania for saint-making and relic collecting". Theft of relics from unreformed communities to increase a church's collection was common, such as Ely Abbey's [...] "relic raid" [...] on Dereham in 974 to obtain the remains of Saint Wihtburg.

2500|$|The {{ratio of}} <b>active</b> <b>power</b> to {{apparent}} {{power in a}} circuit is called the power factor. For two systems transmitting {{the same amount of}} <b>active</b> <b>power,</b> the system with the lower power factor will have higher circulating currents due to energy that returns to the source from energy storage in the load. These higher currents produce higher losses and reduce overall transmission efficiency. [...] A lower power factor circuit will have a higher apparent power and higher losses for the same amount of <b>active</b> <b>power.</b> The power factor is 1.0 when the voltage and current are in phase. [...] It is zero when the current leads or lags the voltage by 90 degrees. Power factors are usually stated as [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] to show the sign of the phase angle of current with respect to voltage. Voltage is designated as the base to which current angle is compared, meaning that we think of current as either [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] voltage. Where the waveforms are purely sinusoidal, the power factor is the cosine of the phase angle (φ) between the current and voltage sinusoid waveforms.

The analysis and design of a drive system for <b>active</b> <b>powered</b> knee prostheses is discussed. The derivation of technical requirements for an active prosthesis system is carried out for an active driven knee prosthesis system. Parameters for the drive system in the active driven knee prosthesis are defined using methods from the engineering of electrical drives.
