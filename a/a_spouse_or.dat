25|$|Couples marrying {{in terms}} of the Civil Union Act may choose whether their union is {{registered}} as a marriage or a civil partnership. In either case, the legal consequences are identical to those of a marriage under the Marriage Act, except for such changes as are required by the context.

25|$|In some societies, people {{sleep with}} at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals. In other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except for an {{intimate}} partner. In almost all societies, sleeping partners are strongly regulated by social standards. For example, a person might only sleep with the immediate family, the extended family, <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> romantic partner, children, children of a certain age, children of specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all. Sleep may be an actively social time, depending on the sleep groupings, with no constraints on noise or activity.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} (also named domestic abuse, battering, {{or family}} violence) {{is a pattern}} of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It may be termed intimate partner violence when committed by <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence may also involve violence against children or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths.|$|E

25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air {{in order to get to}} their meeting points.|$|E
500|$|Hewett practised as a barrister, having {{trained at}} the Inner Temple, where he passed at least one exam in 1890. During the First World War, {{he served in the}} Territorial Force Reserve as an Assistant Provost Marshal, an {{appointment}} which he held from 7 September 1915 until 24 May 1918. He died in Hove, Sussex on 4 March 1921, and his funeral was held in Norton Fitzwarren four days later. His obituary in The Times describes only Hewett's cricket career, and does not give any details about his later life. It does not mention <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> any children. The notice of his funeral in the same paper says: [...] "The whole village [...] was in mourning and among those present at the graveside were Mr H. E. Murray Anderdon, president, and Mr S. M. J. Woods, secretary of the Somerset Cricket Club." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowell was an abolitionist, but his {{opinions}} wavered concerning African-Americans. He advocated suffrage for blacks, yet {{he noted that}} their ability to vote could be troublesome. Even so, he wrote, [...] "We believe the white race, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain sufficient ascendancy to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things." [...] Freed slaves, he wrote, were [...] "dirty, lazy & lying". Even before his marriage to abolitionist Maria White, Lowell wrote: [...] "The abolitionists {{are the only ones}} with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties." [...] After his marriage, Lowell at first did not share his wife's enthusiasm for the cause, but he was eventually pulled in. The couple often gave money to fugitive slaves, even when their own financial situation was not strong, especially if they were asked to free <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> child. Even so, he did not always fully agree with the followers of the movement. The majority of these people, he said, [...] "treat ideas as ignorant persons do cherries. They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed, stones and all." [...] Lowell depicted Southerners very unfavorably in his second collection of The Biglow Papers but, by 1865, admitted that Southerners were [...] "guilty only of weakness" [...] and, by 1868, said that he sympathized with Southerners and their viewpoint on slavery. Enemies and friends of Lowell alike questioned his vacillating interest in the question of slavery. Abolitionist Samuel Joseph May accused him of trying to quit the movement because of his association with Harvard and the Boston Brahmin culture: [...] "Having got into the smooth, dignified, self-complacent, and change-hating society of the college and its Boston circles, Lowell has gone over to the world, and to 'respectability'." ...|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of Yom Kippur, which is {{referred to in the}} Torah (Lev 23:32) as [...] "Shabbat of Shabbatoth", days of public fasting are postponed or advanced if they coincide with Shabbat. Mourners sitting shivah (week of mourning subsequent to the death of <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> first-degree relative) outwardly conduct themselves normally {{for the duration of the}} day and are forbidden to display public signs of mourning.|$|E
2500|$|Elderly {{abuse is}} {{the act of}} using {{physical}} force against an elderly person that causes them physical harm and elderly neglect is the act of not providing for their basic needs. [...] In typical elderly abuse cases, victims are generally older widowed women living on fixed incomes. [...] The typical abuser is usually a family member such as <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> child, but non-relatives such as nursing home attendants can play a part. [...] Most instances of abuse and neglect go unreported because the elderly person is too afraid to speak up.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1994, Springer {{and his new}} producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format {{in order}} to garner higher ratings. The show became more {{successful}} as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism. Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> family member's adultery, homosexuality, prostitution, transvestism, hate group membership, or other controversial situations. [...] These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention. By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching more than 6.7 million viewers.|$|E
50|$|H.R. 3078 waives the {{employee}} portion of Social Security payroll taxes (or self-employment taxes) {{for individuals with}} documented serious illnesses or cancer. It also suspends Social Security taxes for primary caregivers with <b>a</b> sick <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> child.|$|R
50|$|The above laws conferred a {{right of}} {{succession}} on intestacy on the deceased’s blood relations, but none on <b>a</b> surviving <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> <b>an</b> adopted child, and furthermore restricted the intestate succession rights of the extra-marital child. Because marriage in community of property was the norm, such <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> ipso facto took half of the joint estate.|$|R
2500|$|Legal {{definitions}} of adultery vary. For example, New York defines an adulterer {{as a person}} who [...] "engages in sexual intercourse with another person {{at a time when he}} has <b>a</b> living <b>spouse,</b> <b>or</b> the other person has a living spouse." ...|$|R
2500|$|Apomorphine, {{which is}} a {{dopamine}} agonist not orally administered, {{may be used to}} reduce off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are not rare, patients under apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Apomorphine can be administered by subcutaneous injection using a small pump which is carried by the patient. A low dose is automatically administered throughout the day, reducing the fluctuations of motor symptoms by providing a steady dose of dopaminergic stimulation. After an initial [...] "apomorphine challenge" [...] in hospital to test its effectiveness and brief patient and primary caregiver (often <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner), the latter of whom takes over maintenance of the pump. The injection site must be changed daily and rotated around the body to avoid the formation of nodules. Apomorphine is also available in a more acute dose as an autoinjector pen for emergency doses such as after a fall or first thing in the morning. Nausea and vomiting are common, and may require domperidone (an antiemetic).|$|E
2500|$|Marital rape is non-consensual {{sexual contact}} perpetrated against a spouse. It is under-reported, under-prosecuted, and legal in many countries, {{due in part}} to the belief that through marriage, a woman gives {{irrevocable}} consent for her husband to have sex with her when he wishes. In Lebanon, for instance, while discussing a proposed law that would criminalize marital rape, Sheik Ahmad Al-Kurdi, a judge in the Sunni religious court, said that the law [...] "could lead to the imprisonment of the man where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights." [...] Feminists have worked systematically since the 1960s to criminalize marital rape internationally. In 2006, a study by the United Nations found that marital rape was a prosecutable offense in at least 104 countries Once widely condoned or ignored by law and society, marital rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. The countries which ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women, are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> <b>or</b> partner are illegal. The convention came into force in August 2014.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a strange}} life, and {{of the things that}} I saw and learned, could they be written, I might make a tale indeed, but they have no part in this history. For it was as though the smiles and silence with which men and women hide their {{thoughts}} were done away, and their hearts spoke to us in the accents of truth. Now some fair young maid or wife would come to us with confessions of wickedness that would be thought impossible, did not her story prove itself; the secret murder perchance of <b>a</b> <b>spouse,</b> <b>or</b> a lover, or a rival; now some aged dame who would win a husband in his teens, now some wealthy low-born man or woman, who desired to buy an alliance with one lacking money, but of noble blood. Such I did not care to help indeed, but to the love-sick or the love-deluded I listened with a ready ear, for I had a fellow-feeling with them. Indeed so deep and earnest was my sympathy that more than once I found the unhappy fair ready to transfer their affections to my unworthy self, and in fact once things came about so that, had I willed it, I could have married one of the loveliest and wealthiest noble ladies of Seville.|$|E
