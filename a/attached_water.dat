50|$|As of April 2010, Kings County Ventures, LLC, the {{original}} project proponent, had been disbanded, but the partnership is still registered as active in California in 2015.

Quay Valley proponents had planned to use that water for the proposed new city. California law requires that new cities demonstrate that they have sufficient water supplies to survive a five-year drought. Greg Gatzka, Director of the Kings County Community Development Agency, said in April 2010 that the application before his agency to build the project had been inactive for approximately a year and a half. Gaztka added that the project had yet to meet several key requirements in addition to the water issue, including a financial feasibility study and a detailed infrastructure plan. The scarcity of venture capital financing has been cited as another obstacle. Nonetheless, Quay Hays said that he remained interested in seeing the project happen.|$|E
5000|$|The user {{attaches}} a hose to {{the fire}} hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, {{on the order of}} 350 kPa (50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) (this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors including the size and location of the <b>attached</b> <b>water</b> main). This user can attach this hose to a fire engine, which can use a powerful pump to boost the water pressure and possibly split it into multiple streams. One may connect the hose with a threaded connection, instantaneous [...] "quick connector" [...] or a Storz connector. A user should take care not to open or close a fire hydrant too quickly, as this can cause a water hammer, which can damage nearby pipes and equipment. The water inside a charged hose line causes it to be very heavy and high water pressure causes it to be stiff and unable to make a tight turn while pressurized. When a fire hydrant is unobstructed, this is not a problem, as there is enough room to adequately position the hose.|$|E
5000|$|Emerald darters spawn in late April {{and early}} May. Though actual {{spawning}} {{has not been}} observed, attempts by males to mate include swimming {{from side to side}} over the female’s back. Further, males have been observed in the wild trying to mount unresponsive females from behind or from the side. Emerald darter larvae usually measure 4.5 to 6.0 mm in length and emerge from the egg with yolk sacs still <b>attached.</b> <b>Water</b> temperature has a direct correlation with juvenile development, with warmer water temperatures resulting in a faster development and smaller sizes. Warmer temperatures can have even more detrimental effects on populations. Warmer temperatures in the later weeks of the breeding season can cause females to reabsorb their eggs and become unreceptive.Spawning occurs in the center of riffles. Larger males place themselves in pools near the middle of these turbulent areas so they will have a higher probability of encountering more females, which tend to use these areas. Emerald darters prefer gravel substrates that lack silt. Eggs and sperm are released simultaneously through mutual vibration and are attached by the female directly onto the gravel substrate. [...] Emerald darters generally average 36 offspring per year. Most captured emerald darters have been aged at up to three years old. In the Red River drainage, 53% of the population survived its second year, while only 7.7% survived the third. Third-year individuals were predominantly male.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{growth of}} {{microorganisms}} in biofilters and biotrickling filters always {{leads to the}} occurrence of clogging. A good efficiency of removal makes it happen faster.

The BPT is a cascade of plates to whose surface the bacteria <b>attaches.</b> <b>Water</b> flows down and air flows upwards. The reactor shows very good hydrodynamic performance and operates continuously without problem.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to know and control inner factors which influence durability when structures are designed and constructed. The most important factor is mix the proportions, especially the water-cement ratio. Therefore, the accuracy of estimating the water-cement ratio {{is the most important}} point in evaluating durability and estimating life time. However, in the case of existing concrete structures, there is no documentation in most cases. Consequently, in many cases estimation of the water-cement ratio from a hardened concrete sample {{is necessary}} for existing structures. This method is shown in papers of CAJ and JSCE. But there are few experiments and little consideration about the accuracy of estimating mix proportions of hardened concrete. In this paper, accuracy in estimating mix proportions of hardened concrete is studied. And the following results were attained. (1) In order to improve the accuracy of estimating mix proportions, the accuracy of quantifying CaO and measuring <b>attached</b> <b>water</b> must be improved. (2) The test of <b>attached</b> <b>water</b> measurement must be conducted before strength tests on the specimen for estimating mix proportions, because large errors in estimating the amounts of <b>attached</b> <b>water</b> will influence the estimation of the water-cement rati...|$|E

40|$|Using {{broadband}} rotational spectroscopy, {{we report}} {{here on the}} delicate interplay between hydrogen bonds and dispersive forces when an unprecedentedly large organic molecule (camphor, C 10 H 16 O) is microsolvated with up to three molecules of water.

The observation of all possible mono- and multi-H 218 O insertions in the cluster structure yielded accurate structural information that is not otherwise achievable with single-substitution experiments.
