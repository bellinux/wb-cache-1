40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1) as well as the HCO 3 −–Cl− transporter may be involved in CO 2 transport across biological membranes, but the physiological importance of this route of gas transport remained unknown. We studied CO 2 transport in human red blood cell ghosts at physiological temperatures (37 °C). Replacement of inert with CO 2 -containing gas above a stirred cell suspension caused an outside-to-inside directed CO 2 gradient and generated a rapid biphasic intracellular acidification. The gradient of the <b>acidifying</b> <b>gas</b> was kept small to favour high affinity entry of CO 2 passing the membrane. All rates of acidification except that of the approach to physicochemical equilibrium of the uncatalysed reaction were restricted to the intracellular environment. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA) demonstrated that CO 2 -induced acidification required the catalytic activity of CA. Blockade of the function of either AQP 1 (by HgCl 2 at 65 μM) or the HCO 3 −–Cl− transporter (by DIDS at 15 μM) completely prevented fast acidification. These data indicate that, at low chemical gradients for CO 2, nearly the entire CO 2 transport across the red cell membrane is mediated by AQP 1 and the HCO 3 −–Cl− transporter. Therefore, these proteins may function as high affinity sites for CO 2 transport across the erythrocyte membrane...|$|E

Exploitation of raw materials and natural resources, consuming of energy from non-renewable sources, air, water and soil pollution or creation of massive amounts of waste belong to serious issues of society. Each building process, including extraction of raw material, transportation, production of components, build-up, operation or demolition of buildings poses the negative environment impacts. Besides buildings operation, {{which is the most}} energy demanding phase of the life cycle and the phase with the majority of greenhouse and <b>acidifying</b> <b>gasses</b> emissions, selection of material basis is very important. Production of many materials is very non-ecological and requires huge amounts of energy, usually derived from fossil fuels. In this paper materials of a single-family house were analyzed from environmental point of view on the basis of life cycle assessment. Parameters such as amount of used material, global warming potential, acidification potential and primary energy intensity were evaluated.

The ADS {{is used by}} both institutes to determine concentrations of <b>acidifying</b> <b>gases</b> and aerosols in ambient air. After sampling these gases and aerosols are dissolved in deionized, distilled water and concentrations of the corresponding ions are measured. For most of the ions different analytical methods used by the Agricultural University of Wageningen {{on one hand and}} the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection on the other. In this examination samples have been analysed by both institutes for comparison. It has been set up both in order to examine the quality of the analysis methods and to determine, whether the concentrations of gases and aerosols measured by both institutes with their ADSs can be interchanged in further research. Good agreement was found for sulfate, ammonium and hydronium, Concentrations of nitrite measured by the Agricultural University of Wageningen were 10 times lower than those determined by the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection. This difference can be presumably attributed to a calibration or a calculation error. After correction for this error the agreement was rather good. Nitrate concentrations from denuder samples showed relatively large differences, which may have been caused by instabilities in the corresponding solutions. Due to this differences the corresponding nitric acid concentrations can not be interchanged. Differences in nitrate concentrations from filter samples were acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of ocean}} wave energy for {{electricity}} production has considerable potential, {{though it has}} proven to be difficult. A technology utilizing the heaving (up-and-down) motions of the waves was conceived at Uppsala University in the early 2000 ´s, and is being further developed for commercial use by Seabased Industry AB. The purpose of this master´s degree project was to increase the knowledge of the environmental performance of Seabased´s wave energy conversion concept and identifying possible areas of improvement. This was done by conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a hypothetical prototype wave power plant. All flows of materials, energy, emissions and waste were calculated for all stages of a wave power plant´s life cycle. The potential environmental impact of these flows was then assessed, using the following impact categories: - Emission of greenhouse gases - Emission of ozone depleting gases - Emission of <b>acidifying</b> <b>gases</b> - Emission of gases that contribute to the forming of ground-level ozone - Emission of substances to water contributing to oxygen depletion (eutrophication) - Energy use (renewable and non-renewable) - Water use The methodology used was that prescribed by the ISO standard for Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) and further defined by the International EPD Programme. The potential environmental impact was calculated per kWh of wave power electricity delivered to the grid. The main result of the study is that the potential environmental impact of a wave power plant mainly stems from the manufacturing phase. In particular, the production of steel parts makes a large contribution to the overall results. Future wave power plant designs are expected to be considerably more material efficient, meaning that there are large possibilities to improve the environmental performance of this technology...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarFrom October 1987 {{until april}} 1990 {{concentrations}} of the <b>acidifying</b> <b>gases</b> SO 2, HNO 2, HNO 3, NH 3 and particulate sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and hydronium were measured at three {{sites in the}} Netherlands, using Annular Denuder Systems. The locations, an urban, a suburban and a rural were situated from the northeast {{to the west of}} the country. Daily samples were taken, once in eight days at each location. During some smog episodes and periods corresponding with intensive epidemiological health studies, the sampling scheme was intensified at one or two locations. A fourth, urban site was included during the winter of 1989 / 1990. Additional field and laboratory experiments were performed to examine the precision and performance of the Annular Denuder System method. Validation procedures were developed in order to determine the reliability of the primary results and to eliminate results not satisfying certain criteria. Precision for the eight components varied between 2 and 15 % and their accuracy between 5 and 25 %. Detection limits were all low. The method showed rather good agreement with others. Disadvantages are the limited denuder capacity and hence limited measuring range for ammonia and the low time resolution (sampling must be done for at leat 3 and preferably 12 or 24 hours). Further, the method is time consuming and can hardly be automated. The study showed that average concentrations of H+ and HNO 3 at the four sites were low (10 nmol/m 3) compared to values found in other countries, whereas for sulfate, nitrate and ammonium they were considerably larger, i. e. 100 to 200 nmol/m 3. Elevated values were found for HNO 3, sulfate, nitrate and ammonium during stable weather conditions. Ammonia concentrations at all sites were relatively large due to intensive lifestock breeding. The ammonia neutralizes acidifying aerosol and explains the low H+ values. Values for nitrous acid were rather large, probably as a result of the high traffic density in the Netherlands. Aerosol component concentrations at different sites were highly correlated, which can be explained from their stability and low deposition velocity...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reported}} here focuses on the environmental pressure exerted by large-scale eucalyptus-based kraft pulp industry in Thailand. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the most important sources of greenhouse <b>gases,</b> <b>acidifying</b> and eutrophying compounds and tropospheric ozone precursors, human toxicity compounds and solid waste associated with the kraft pulp industry. To this end, we performed an environmental systems analysis of the kraft pulp industry system in which we distinguished between two subsystems: the eucalyptus forestry subsystem and the kraft pulp production subsystem. The results indicate that the environmental pressure is caused by the kraft pulp production subsystem rather than by the eucalyptus forestry one. The chemical recovery unit was found to be the most important source of carbon dioxide (CO 2) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and responsible for more than one-half of the emissions of greenhouse <b>gases</b> and <b>acidifying</b> compounds from eucalyptus-based kraft pulp production in Thailand. Biomass combustion in the energy gene ration unit is an important source of nitrogen oxide (NO x) and carbon monoxide (CO) which in turn are responsible for over 50 % of the emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors. About 73 % of the eutrophication is caused by biological aerobic wastewater treatment emitting phosphorus (P).

40|$|Ph. D. (Environmental Science) A {{number of}} studies to detect effects of {{atmospheric}} acidic deposition on regional environments have been conducted in South Africa in the past, without finding any clear evidence of adverse effects. Despite these studies, scepticism remained that acidic deposition could accumulate on the decadal scale and {{reach a point where}} the natural buffering capacities of soils and water bodies would be exceeded. Against this background, this study was conceived to make direct measurements of atmospheric concentrations of the <b>acidifying</b> <b>gases,</b> over as an extensive area as possible, to provide an objective basis {{to the question of whether}} or not acidic deposition pose immediate or long-term threats to regional ecosystems. As an integral study, the research strategy was designed to address the question as to whether ozone, as a secondary pollutant, would exceed the tolerance of the same ecosystems. A passive monitoring network was devised to measure monthly mean atmospheric concentrations of three trace gas species, SO 2, NO 2 and O 3. The network comprised of 37 monitoring sites at remote locations over the northern and eastern portions of South Africa, at 1 º grid intervals (0. 5 º for several sites). Trace gases were sampled monthly over two complete annual cycles at each site, using passive diffusive samplers exposed for approximately 30 days. Samples were chemically analysed at an internationally accredited laboratory (Atmospheric Chemistry Research Group, North-West University) and mean monthly results were recorded. The collated database of trace gas concentrations enabled assessment in terms of standards, time and spatial distributions. Concentrations were evaluated in a critical levels assessment against several sets of South African and international standards and guidelines. The dry deposition rates were calculated from measured ambient trace gas concentrations, using an inferential model. For estimates of wet deposition, long-term acidic rainfall measurements were multiplied by the cumulative precipitation within the sampling period amount for each project site. These total dry and wet deposition estimates (for sulphur and nitrogen compounds), and concentrations of ozone were compared with results from two regional-scale studies of modelled concentration and deposition. The total acidic deposition estimates were adjusted with mitigating base cation deposition estimates, dry and wet, and the derived net acidity loads were subtracted from soils acid buffering (sensitivity) capacity loads to determine critical loads exceedance. Two ancillary tasks were undertaken, which contribute to the central aim. The first accessed the most recent measured regional lighting strokes data and adjusted it for intra/inter-cloud strokes to estimate the lightning produced NOx (LNOx) budget. High and a low lightning NOx budget estimates were then compared with three relevant anthropogenic emission inventories compiled for the Highveld region. The second task obtained regional SO 2, NO 2 and O 3 remote sensing information and compared them with ground level concentrations from the passive sampling network. Remote sensing total column densities were converted and partitioned through atmospheric pressure averaging equations to derive tropospheric boundary concentrations appropriate for comparisons. vi The main findings were: • Concentration distributions for acidic gases SO 2 and NO 2 show prevailing high concentrations over the industrial Highveld. The areas downwind show substantially decreased concentrations, while remote areas show very low concentrations. Ozone concentrations are spatially uniform, with slightly increased concentrations located away from the central Highveld pollution source area, both north and south. However, ozone distributions and origins could not be directly related to the Highveld industrial emissions. No health-based exceedance (of long-term standards) was recorded for SO 2, NO 2 or O 3. Three areas of critical exceedances were found for SO 2, one in the industrial Highveld for sensitive lichen and semi-natural and forest vegetation; and two downwind, for sensitive lichen only. No ecosystem exceedance was established of NO 2 and O 3 critical levels. • Acidic deposition distributions showed a direct relationship to high atmospheric concentration distributions, with exceptions for those areas which had high annual rainfall, and for coastal and escarpment areas where wet deposition prevailed. No concurrent regional modelling had been performed by other parties. Two non-concurrent regional modelling studies were selected for comparison of measured and modelling results. Substantial disparities were identified between the respective results and, although general patterns were followed, the modelling for dry and wet acidic compounds swayed from overestimates to underestimates for sulphur and nitrogen species. In contrast, modelling of ozone mainly overestimated measured concentrations. In terms of spatial distributions, ozone modelling matched a wide band of elevated concentrations in northern area of South Africa (Limpopo Province). • Derived net acidic deposition loads were matched to critical loads from soil types in the region. This revealed areas with high deposition and highly sensitive local soils within the greater industrial Highveld with critical load exceedance. An area north-west of the central Highveld showed exceedance of the highest critical load, while several smaller areas downwind to the south-east showed exceedances of lower critical loads only. • The lightning NOx budget estimation showed that lightning NOx is a significant contributor to overall regional NOx budget and a major natural contributor. Depending on lightning count assumptions applied, annual LNOx production varied from a 1 / 10 th to 1 / 3 rd of the NOx anthropogenic trace gases emissions, taken from the most comprehensive of three recent inventories. However, when seasonal lightning budgets were examined, no distinct seasonal increases in ground-level NOx were found in areas of high lightning frequency, suggesting that much of LNOx is generated and transported above the boundary layer. • Comparisons of remote sensing concentrations results for SO 2 and O 3 have not revealed very good spatial and temporal agreement, although both showed agreement within an order of magnitude between measured and remotely sensed concentrations. NO 2 agreement was much better in both spatial and temporal comparisons. The mean ratio of remotely sensed to measured NOx is 0. 77, an encouraging result given the broad assumptions made in deriving the comparison. Disparities in the horizontal distributions between ground level and satellite products for NOx indicate a need for better information on the vertical distributions of NOx vii and other trace gases – the assumption of a uniformly mixed boundary layer is not robust enough for such comparisons. From findings of all individual studies an overall answer to the central question is reached that pollution from acidic gases and their compounds is not a current or medium term threat to regional ecosystems (beyond the central pollution source area), at current rates of emission. Results from the control site, positioned specifically within the well-researched industrial Highveld, confirmed the known situation in this sub-region, while serving well to put in perspective the entire region. Ozone distributions indicate uniform regional distributions, with most monthly means below 30 ppb, and highest single month 43 ppb. Now that this project has established a detailed measured set of acidic trace gas concentrations, limiting factors in determining critical loads are (i) more detailed maps of soil sensitivity (acidic buffering capacity); and (ii) base cation deposition measurements, including dry deposition of dust, and wet deposition, both at more sites and over similar periods used in the current study for the acid components...|$|R
