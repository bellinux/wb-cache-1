5|$|Perhaps most important, the <b>Analytical</b> Review {{provided}} {{a forum for}} radical political and religious ideas. Although it aimed at impartiality, its articles were often critical of the British government and supportive of the French revolutionaries. While the journal had low circulation numbers for its day, it still influenced popular opinion and was feared by the conservative government of William Pitt the Younger. In late 1797, the Anti-Jacobin, the self-styled nemesis of the <b>Analytical</b> Review, was founded by supporters {{of the government and}} other reactionary interests; it criticized the radical politics of the <b>Analytical</b> and monitored it for unpatriotic and irreligious sentiments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Analytical</b> Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the <b>Analytical</b> helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical astronomers use several tools {{including}} <b>analytical</b> {{models and}} computational numerical simulations; {{each has its}} particular advantages. <b>Analytical</b> models of a process are generally better for giving broader insight {{into the heart of}} what is going on.

5|$|After its {{suspension}} {{with the}} December 1798 issue, the <b>Analytical</b> Review lay dormant {{until it was}} briefly revived as The <b>Analytical</b> Review (New Series) {{during the first six}} months of 1799. It was printed and sold by T. Hurst of Paternoster Row, apparently without any connection to Johnson or the prior reviewers. Unlike its predecessor, the new series was cautious; it reviewed relatively uncontroversial works and its articles did not have initialled signatures. This series lasted only from January until June 1799.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Analytical</b> Review offered {{its readers}} {{access to a}} wide variety of works. In July 1789, when the Bastille fell, the <b>Analytical</b> {{reviewed}} The Rural Economy of Gloucestershire, Life of Thomas Chatterton, Transactions in Bengal, Military Operations on the Coromandel Coast, Poetry and Music of the Italian Opera, and Histoire Politique de la Revolution en France. The journal also laid provocative facts before the public to prompt them to think and, if necessary, to take action, although it claimed not to advocate one viewpoint over another. For example, when philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke issued his politically controversial Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), the <b>Analytical</b> Review reviewed it extensively, as well as the many responses to it, such as Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), Vindiciae Gallicae (1791) by James Mackintosh, and Rights of Man (1791) by Thomas Paine. However, the majority of the excerpts that the reviewers chose to publish came from the rebuttals to Burke's work.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Analytical</b> Review {{suspended}} {{publication in}} December 1798 after {{the deaths of}} Christie (1796) and Wollstonecraft (1797), the conviction of Johnson for seditious libel (1798) and the retirement of other contributing editors.|$|E
5|$|The demises of the Theological Repository and the New Review left a {{publishing}} vacuum; the arrival in London {{of the author}} Thomas Christie, who was dedicated to starting a new periodical that would replace and perhaps even improve upon these precursors, was the primary impetus {{in the creation of}} the <b>Analytical</b> Review. Johnson and Christie were mutual friends of Priestley and others, and their combined interest in beginning such a journal resulted in the foundation of the <b>Analytical</b> Review.|$|E

25|$|During a nine-month {{period in}} 1842–43, Lovelace {{translated}} the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea's article on Babbage's newest proposed machine, the <b>Analytical</b> Engine. With the article, she appended {{a set of}} notes. Explaining the <b>Analytical</b> Engine's function was a difficult task, as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was uninterested in it. Lovelace's notes even had {{to explain how the}} <b>Analytical</b> Engine differed from the original Difference Engine. Her work was well received at the time; the scientist Michael Faraday described himself as a supporter of her writing.|$|E
25|$|The more {{comprehensive}} approach to assessment of ion suppression is to constantly infuse an appropriate concentration into the mobile phase flow, downstream from the <b>analytical</b> column, using a syringe pump and a 'tee union'.

25|$|Protein {{purification}} {{is either}} preparative or <b>analytical.</b> Preparative purifications aim {{to produce a}} relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes (e.g. lactase), nutritional proteins (e.g. soy protein isolate), and certain biopharmaceuticals (e.g. insulin). <b>Analytical</b> purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein {{for a variety of}} research or <b>analytical</b> purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the protein's structure, post-translational modifications and function. Pepsin and urease were the first proteins purified {{to the point that they}} could be crystallized.|$|E
