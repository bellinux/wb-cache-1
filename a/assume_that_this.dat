In its absence the player would lose on every fight, which would not be obvious as a copy protection effect right away as one could <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was just due to either lack of experience or proper equipment. The protection mechanism was subtle enough to be overlooked by the German distributor which originally delivered Atari 8bit packages with floppies that were formatted regularly, and thus these paid copies acted like unlicensed copies, causing players to lose every battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinion that}} the Agathyrsi were almost {{certainly}} Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, {{and we know that}} the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also gets into the drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E
500|$|During the SETI program, Earth's {{scientists}} {{send out}} transmissions (shown {{to be the}} Arecibo message) with information about Earth and its inhabitants, DNA structure, etc., in hopes of finding life beyond Earth. They then receive transmissions from an alien source on how to create endless fuel effortlessly. Therefore, the scientists <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a friendly alien species. From a second alien transmission, the scientists receive information about an alien DNA along with {{instructions on how to}} splice it with human DNA. A government team led by Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) goes forward with the genetic experiment attempting to induce a female, under the (later proved to be mistaken) assumption that a female would have [...] "more docile and controllable" [...] traits. One of the hundred experimental ova produces a girl named Sil, who looks like a normal human but develops into a 12-year-old in 3 months.|$|E
500|$|Mileena {{was one of}} the {{characters}} cited by Guy Aoki as allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts. In the 1996 moral panic themed book Interacting With Video, which condemned violence of video games as supposedly affecting social behaviour and causing real-life violence, Patricia Marks Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking used the [...] "two Asian twin sisters, Mileena and Kitana," [...] {{as an example of a}} [...] "highly eroticized dragon lady" [...] trope, with Mileena's [...] "Man-Eater" [...] Fatality described as [...] "a high-powered kiss that evokes vagina dentata." [...] The authors wrote that despite the inclusion of [...] "characters of color" [...] such as the two and Jax, [...] "we cannot <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> greater diversity represents a more progressive identity politics, for one could argue that it merely increases the racist and sexist potential of individual fights." [...] Critical studies professor Marsha Kinder similarly accused Mortal Kombat II of [...] "allowing you to have a misogynistic aspect of combat," [...] alleging that [...] "some of the most violent possibilities are against women," [...] whose own [...] "fatality moves are highly eroticised." [...] Kinder singled out Mileena to describe how the character can kill her opponent [...] "by sucking him in and spitting out his bones. Talk about Spider Woman!" ...|$|E

500|$|Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base {{commands}} including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No.7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out {{of first}} Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He {{then returned to}} RAAF Station Laverton {{to take charge of}} No.1 Aircraft Depot (No.1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: [...] "...it is easy to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} Lord Hoffmann in Hall v Simons (2001) {{had said that}} a witness owed no duty of care in respect of his evidence, only a duty to tell the truth, but he {{considered}} that to be incorrect, since it failed to distinguish between witnesses of fact and experts. The expert would have {{a contract with the}} client in which he agreed to perform the duties that he owed to the court, and so there was no conflict between the two duties. In this respect, expert witnesses were more like advocates, who owed duties to client and court, than to witnesses of fact. He noted that barristers had long been immune from negligence claims until the decision of the House of Lords in Hall v Simons. Removing their immunity, he said, had not led to any diminution in advocates performing their duty to the court, and it would be [...] "mere conjecture" [...] to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> would be any different for expert witnesses. Neither had vexatious claims been a problem for barristers – in any event, the present case was not vexatious and there were other hurdles, both procedural and financial, in the way of an unsuccessful litigant making unmeritorious claims against an expert. As there was no justification for continuing to hold that expert witnesses were [...] "immune from suit in relation to the evidence they give in court or for the views they express in anticipation of court proceedings", he concluded that the immunity for claims for breach of duty (but not defamation) should be abolished.|$|E

2500|$|The Pali canon also {{describes}} Buddhist monks (epitomized by {{the monk}} Gagga) with symptoms {{of what would}} today be called mental illness.

This was termed the madmans leave (ummattakasammuti) The texts also <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> 'madness' can be cured or recovered from, or is at least an impermanent phenomenon, after which, during confession, the monk is considered sane by the sangha once more.|$|E
2500|$|Leslie's {{comments}} are not unimpeachable. The reference to an [...] "inclined plane" [...] in original sources has led him and some modern writers to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a rope-worked incline with the wagons on rails, {{but this is}} not supported by any contemporary document. The limited financial and technical resources available at this time (Watt had long since departed) suggest that this might have been simply a sloping causeway on which boxes of coals were dragged down loaded, and back up empty. Alternatively it may have had rails—not necessarily metal—with single wagons making the transit. Hutton (page 42) refers to rails at this time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{river that}} feeds Lima is called Rímac {{and many people}} erroneously <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is because its {{original}} Inca name is [...] "Talking River" [...] (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua where the word for [...] "talker" [...] was pronounced [...] ). However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not Incas. This name is an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym {{so that it would}} conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua. Later, as the original inhabitants died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. Nowadays, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city {{and the name of the}} river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.|$|E

Goizueta, Coca-Cola's CEO, described the new flavor as [...] "bolder", [...] "rounder", and [...] "more harmonious", and defended the change {{by saying that the}} drink's secret formula was not sacrosanct and inviolable. As far back as 1935, Coca-Cola sought kosher certification from an Atlanta rabbi and made two changes to the formula so the drink could be considered kosher (as well as halal and vegetarian). Goizueta also refused to admit that taste tests had led the change, calling it [...] "one of the easiest decisions we've ever made.") A reporter asked whether Diet Coke would also be reformulated [...] "assuming [...] is a success," [...] to which Goizueta curtly replied, [...] "No. And I didn't <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a success. This is a success." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} theory, {{proposed by}} Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution. The designation [...] "Neomuran revolution" [...] {{refers to the}} appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because {{they are based on}} the [...] "theoretically and empirically" [...] unsound model of molecular clocks. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy, until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.|$|E
