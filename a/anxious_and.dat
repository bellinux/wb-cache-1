5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on the table beside him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E

5|$|George visited Russia {{again in}} 1867 {{to meet with}} his sister Dagmar, who had married Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander III) the year before. He was {{determined}} to find a wife {{and the idea of}} an alliance with a Russian grand duchess, born into the Eastern Orthodox Church, appealed to him. Olga fell in love with George, but she was nevertheless <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> distraught at the thought of leaving Russia. Her father was initially reluctant to agree to their marriage, thinking that at the age of fifteen she was too young and, being close to his daughter, concerned by the distance between Greece and Russia. For her part, Grand Duchess Alexandra was much more enthusiastic than her husband and, when some members of the imperial family noted the extreme youth of her daughter, she replied that Olga would not always be as young. Eventually, it was decided that Olga and George would marry when she had reached her sixteenth birthday. Meanwhile, she would continue her schoolwork until her wedding day.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{association}} between life events <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression {{might be due}} to causality or to gene–environment correlation. We examined unidirectional and reciprocal causality and a gene–environment correlation model, in which genes that influence the vulnerability for anxious depression also increase the risk of exposure to life events. The effect of genes that influence environmental exposure might be mediated through personality and we therefore also examined the {{association between}} life events and personality (neuroticism and extraversion). Method. Information on life events, <b>anxious</b> depression, neuroticism <b>and</b> extraversion was collected in 5782 monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins who participated in a longitudinal survey study of the Netherlands Twin Register. To examine causality, data were analysed longitudinally. To examine gene–environment correlation, the cotwin control method was used. Results. <b>Anxious</b> depression <b>and,</b> to a lesser extent, neuroticism scores increased after exposure to life events. <b>Anxious</b> depression <b>and</b> neuroticism also predicted the experience of life events. Prospectively, extraversion was not associated with life events. <b>Anxious</b> depression, neuroticism <b>and</b> extraversion scores did not differ between the non-exposed subjects of MZ and DZ twin pairs and unrelated subjects discordant for life events.

40|$|Objectives. —To {{investigate}} (1) whether shared genetic factors influence migraine <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression; (2) {{whether the}} genetic architecture of migraine depends on anxious depression; (3) whether {{the association between}} migraine <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression is causal. Background. —Migraine <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression frequently occur together, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms causing this association. Methods. —A twin study was conducted to model the genetic architecture of migraine <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression <b>and</b> the covariance between them. Anxious depression was also added to the model as a moderator variable to examine whether anxious depression affects the genetic architecture of migraine. Causal models were explored with the co-twin control method. Results. —Modest but significant phenotypic (rP = 0. 28), genetic (rG = 0. 30), and nonshared environmental (rE = 0. 26) correlations were found between the 2 traits. Interestingly, the heritability of migraine depended on the level of anxious depression: the higher the anxious depression score, the lower the relative contribution of genetic factors to the individual differences in migraine susceptibility. The observed risk patterns in discordant twins are most consistent with a bidirectional causal relationship. Conclusions. —These findings confirm the genetic association between migraine <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression <b>and</b> are consistent with a syndromic association between the 2 traits. This highlights the importance of taking comorbidity into account in geneti...|$|R

25|$|With the {{discovery}} of recombinant DNA by Cohen and Boyer in 1973, the idea that genetic engineering would have major human and societal consequences was born. In July 1974, a group of eminent molecular biologists headed by Paul Berg wrote to Science suggesting that {{the consequences of this}} work were so potentially destructive {{that there should be a}} pause until its implications had been thought through. This suggestion was explored at a meeting in February 1975 at California's Monterey Peninsula, forever immortalized by the location, Asilomar. Its historic outcome was an unprecedented call for a halt in research until it could be regulated in such a way that the public need not be <b>anxious,</b> <b>and</b> it led to a 16-month moratorium until National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines were established.|$|E

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of perfectionism and its developmental trajectory and impact on children {{has experienced a}} recent growth. Research has shown that child perfectionism {{is associated with a}} number of negative outcomes including anxiety and depressive disorders, hopelessness, poor psychosocial treatment outcomes, and researchers have not found it to be associated with actual achievement. As such, research has begun to examine the developmental risk factors that predict for its development. The current study proposes utilizing a developmental psychopathology approach, one that purports a complex interaction among internal, external, risk and protective processes in the developmental of perfectionism. Specifically, the study examined whether negative affect, effortful control, <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> rearing would predict levels of perfectionism in children using path analysis. Effortful control and negative affect were measured using parent-report, anxious rearing was measured by parent- and child-report, and perfectionism was measured through self-report and a behavioral task. It was hypothesized that child-reported <b>anxious</b> rearing <b>and</b> perfectionism measured with a behavioral task would provide the best fitting model and provide at least an adequate fit for the data. Additionally, it was hypothesized that in this model <b>anxious</b> rearing <b>and</b> negative affect would predict increased levels of child perfectionism, {{that there would be a}} significant indirect effect of anxious rearing on the association between negative affect and perfectionism, and that effortful control would interact with negative affect <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> rearing in the prediction of child perfectionism. Participants were 60 parent-child dyads with children between the ages of 7 and 13 recruited from the community. Overall, results partially supported the hypotheses. The best fitting model used child-reported <b>anxious</b> rearing <b>and</b> behaviorally assessed perfectionism. Within this model, <b>anxious</b> rearing <b>and</b> effortful control significantly predicted for child perfectionism. However, negative affect did not predict child perfectionism. Additionally, there was a significant indirect effect of anxious rearing. Lastly, the interaction between effortful control <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> rearing <b>and,</b> separately, negative affect did not significantly predict for child perfectionism. Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and conceptual implications for the study of child perfectionism and suggestions for future research are presented...|$|R
40|$|Background: Earlier {{studies have}} shown that {{employment}} and burnout are related to anxiety and depression. This twin-family study investigates to what extent these associations are caused by shared etiological factors. Methods: In a sample of 4309 Dutch twins and 1008 siblings, bivariate genetic analyses of employment <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression <b>and</b> of burnout <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression were carried out using structural equation modelling. Results: Employment <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression were both influenced by genetic and individual-specific environmental factors. The association between employment <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression was small, but significant, estimated at - 0. 08. Power was too low to decide whether the covariance was explained by genetic or environmental factors. In burnout, familial clustering was due to genetic factors in men, but to genetic and common environmental factors in women. In both sexes, there was a strong correlation of around 0. 40 with anxious depression, which was explained by shared genetic and shared individual-specific environmental factors. Limitations: The group of unemployed subjects in our sample not only contained subjects who were searching for a job, but also subjects who were out of the labour force. Conclusions: Associations between employment <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression as well as between burnout <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression are due to overlapping genetic and individual-specific environmental factors. Work related circumstances, e. g. financial strain or work-family conflict, might be of importance in burnout <b>and</b> <b>anxious</b> depression. These results support the notion that a genetic vulnerability for depression also increases the risk for exposure to high-risk environments, such as unemployment. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

Around 186, the commandery {{administration}} had a dispute with their superiors, the provincial administration of Qing Province. Both sides wrote to the imperial court in the capital Luoyang to complain about each other. At the time, since the imperial court often made decisions on a first-come, first-served basis, it meant that the court would tend to rule in favour of the party whose document it received first.

25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> was drinking heavily.

The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E
25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or <b>anxious</b> <b>and</b> become repetitive.|$|E

40|$|An individual’s {{self-reported}} {{abilities to}} attend to, understand, and reinterpret emotional situations or events {{have been associated}} with anxiety and depression, but it is unclear how these abilities affect the processing of emotional stimuli, especially in individuals with these symptoms. The present study recorded event-related brain potentials while individuals reporting features of anxiety and depression completed an emotion-word Stroop task. Results indicated that anxious apprehension, <b>anxious</b> arousal, <b>and</b> depression were associated with self-reported emotion abilities, consistent with prior literature. In addition, lower <b>anxious</b> apprehension <b>and</b> greater reported emotional clarity were related to slower processing of negative stimuli indexed by event-related potentials (ERPs). Higher <b>anxious</b> arousal <b>and</b> reported attention to emotion were associated with ERP evidence of early attention to all stimuli regardless of emotional content. Reduced later engagement with stimuli was also associated with <b>anxious</b> arousal <b>and</b> with clarity of emotions. Depression was not differentially associated with any emotion processing stage indexed by ERPs. Research in this area may lead to the development of therapies that focus on minimization of anxiety to foster successful emotion regulation...|$|R
