5|$|Jason Michael Kipnis {{was born}} on April 3, 1987 in Northbrook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He was the fourth child born to Kay and Mark Kipnis. He has two older brothers, Blair and Todd. His older sister Amanda played {{softball}} at the University of Maryland. As a child, his father {{played an important role}} in his baseball life. He played Little League and American Legion Baseball. Though Kipnis played baseball, football and soccer while growing up, he said there was never <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> his goal was to become a professional baseball player.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah and Talmud {{distinguish}} between ritual or criminal matters and monetary matters (issurim and mamonoth) and impose different regulations for them, with criminal cases generally having much more stringent limitations. Courts ruled in {{both kinds of}} cases. <b>Any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> could not be resolved by a smaller court was passed up to a higher court. If the Sanhedrin was still uncertain, divine opinion was sought through the Urim ve-Tumim (the parchment in the High Priest's breastplate, which was inscribed with the Name of God and could give supernatural clues).|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

2500|$|Locatelli was {{survived by}} his brothers, Albert and Harry. CIA Director, former Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, a 1960 Santa Clara classmate of Locatelli's, stated after Father Locatelli's death that, [...] "What Paul told you was always the truth. He didn't play games. You knew that {{what he said was}} what he believed. I don't think there is <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> he (Father Locatelli) will go down as one of the {{greatest}} presidents in Santa Clara history." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{an airline}} manager, he gained a {{reputation}} of union busting, stemming from his leadership during the 1983 bankruptcy of Continental that enabled the company to void its union contracts, and during the strike and bankruptcy of Eastern that eventually led to its permanent shutdown in 1991. Lorenzo’s history is contentious, both “despised by unions and admired by airline strategists.” In 1990, after Lorenzo liquidated his holdings after 18 years in the airline industry, Alfred E. Kahn, the “main architect of airline deregulation,” offered this perspective on Lorenzo’s leadership: “I don’t think there is <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> he saved Continental, but his tactics obviously didn’t work {{when he took over}} Eastern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{established}} as Holy Scripture, {{there has never}} been <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the Orthodox Church holds the full list of books to be venerable and beneficial for reading and study, even though it informally holds some books in higher esteem than others, the four gospels highest of all. Of the subgroups significant enough to be named, the [...] "Anagignoskomena" [...] (ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, [...] "things that are read") comprises ten of the Old Testament books rejected in the Protestant canon, but deemed by the Orthodox worthy to be read in worship services, even though they carry a lesser esteem than the 39 books of the Hebrew canon. The lowest tier contains the remaining books not accepted by either Protestants or Roman Catholics, among them, Psalm 151. Though it is a psalm, and is in the book of psalms, it is not classified as being within the Psalter (the first 150 psalms), and hence does not participate in the various liturgical and prayer uses of the Psalter.|$|E

2500|$|Weltlich's {{next three}} teams posted yearly {{improvements}} in overall records, although the 1983–84 Longhorns {{did so by}} the margin of a single game over the prior year, finishing the season 7–21. Texas managed four wins against Division I competition, with a 62–61 road win over Utah in non-conference play, to end a 21-game road losing streak, and three wins against conference competition—two against Baylor and one over Rice. The Longhorns were also generally more competitive in their many defeats, with their 13 SWC losses coming {{by an average of}} 15.0 points, for a one-third reduction in the average margin of defeat from the previous season. Texas played respectably in two losses to eventual second-consecutive national runner-up Houston, losing by 11 to the No. 7 Cougars in Houston and by the same margin to No. 5 Houston in Austin. After trailing 19th-ranked Arkansas 45–27 at halftime in Austin, Texas narrowed the Razorbacks' lead to 68–66 in the final minute before Arkansas added two final points to secure the win. Nonetheless, the 1983–84 season saw a number of particularly lopsided defeats, with a 103–72 loss to SMU and a 74–47 loss to Texas Tech representing what remain the third- and ninth-worst home losses in program history. As fan criticism of Weltlich began to mount, Dodds professed to be [...] "losing no sleep over basketball at UT" [...] and said, [...] "I don't think there's <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the direction Bob has taken is the right one. No one expected this to be easy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Marshall {{addressed}} the Commerce Clause issue first. The majority agreed with Commonwealth Edison's claim that, {{even though a}} tax is imposed before the goods become interstate commerce, {{this does not mean}} the tax evades constitutional analysis. Rejecting the reasoning in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U.S. 245 (1922), the majority [...] "disapproved" [...] of any distinction between intrastate and interstate commerce {{based on the idea that}} the Commerce Clause denies states the right to burden interstate commerce, and concluded that state severance taxes came under the jurisdiction of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. The respondents argued that the appropriate test for evaluating a tax under the Commerce Clause should be the four-prong test set forth in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977), and that the Montana tax violated the third prong of the Complete Auto Transit test by discriminating against out-of-state consumers of Montana's coal. But the majority concluded no discrimination existed, because the tax burden was borne equally by all out-of-state consumers. The appellants also argued the tax violated the fourth prong of the test because it was not [...] "fairly related to the services provided by the State" [...] (e.g., the amount of the tax collected exceeds the cost of services provided). But the majority disagreed: Commonwealth Edison had fundamentally misconstrued the Court's test in Complete Auto. The Montana Supreme Court had characterized the severance tax as intended for general government purposes, a finding the U.S. Supreme Court refused to dispute. Thus, there could be no [...] "excessiveness" [...] test. Nor was there <b>any</b> <b>question</b> <b>that</b> the state of Montana had the right to levy the tax for the purposes it did. Justice Marshall next identified how the fourth prong of the Complete Auto test should be interpreted: ...|$|E
