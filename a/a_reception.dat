5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold <b>a</b> <b>reception</b> for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn down. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs.
