60|$|Mr. Godfrey started up, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|He {{shrugged his}} shoulders, spread {{out his hands}} and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the wall.|$|E
60|$|Norah roused {{herself from}} the volume she was reading, and glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the library mantel-piece.|$|E
60|$|Cork looked seriously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> big <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> Rooney's wall. <b>The</b> girl's {{ubiquitous}} eyes {{took in the}} movement.|$|R
60|$|Granet was {{thoughtful}} for a moment. He glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dashboard {{opposite to}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{sleep for}} me! sleep if you can--I mean {{to sit up}} with a decanter!--let me see"--looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ormolu <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel--"it's only two hours to morning." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Loring glanced {{once more}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantel-piece. The hands {{pointed to the}} dinner hour.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> {{the mantelpiece}} and counted: 'One, two, three, four, five hours, thirty-five minutes. It is an age yet,' she laughed.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{looking across}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantel-piece, and realizing that Mr. Yahi-Bahi {{must have been}} delayed and that {{something}} must be done, she said: ...|$|E
60|$|He was not {{prepared}} for what followed. Euphrasia did not answer at once, but presently her knitting dropped to her lap, and she sat staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen shelf.|$|R
60|$|The little {{fire had}} gone out. Beatrice glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> and put <b>on</b> her jacket again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's about {{a quarter}} to ten,' said Lawford, having glanced first <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stopped <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chimney-piece and then at his watch. He then sat quite still and endeavoured to sit <b>at</b> ease, while <b>the</b> old lady lifted her bonneted head and ever so gravely and benignly {{surveyed}} him.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantelpiece. [...] "Before {{the half-hour}} strikes. Don't be alarmed," [...] she added, {{with an air}} of ironical sympathy; [...] "you will have time to make your escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] General Brice continued, glancing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> his desk, [...] "Granet is in my {{anteroom}} at the present moment, I expect. He asked for an interview this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh I daresay she's all right," [...] {{he said as}} if {{he wanted}} to get on with his work. He looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantel-shelf; he would have to put in another hour.|$|E
40|$|Carolyn Weathers' {{birthday}} reading <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Los Feliz Library, {{when it was}} a storefront. Her 43 rd birthday. (Top left) Carolyn, Rusty Rusten, Petie Alzanauer, Lynn Rabin. (Top right) Carson Wiley, Marsha Salisbury, Carolyn, Teri Shannon, {{with back}} to camera. (Bottom right) Looking down on a library table with white linen cloth, flowers, paper cups and plates, bowls of food and the decadent fruit tart.

60|$|He {{glanced up}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tower <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> ferry building. It was ten minutes after one--time {{enough to catch}} the quarter-past-one boat. That decided him, and without the least idea {{in the world as}} to where he was going, he paid ten cents for a ticket, passed through the gate, and was soon {{speeding}} across the bay to the pretty city of Oakland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must have}} been here four hours now, an' Sam Barney left 'bout half-past seven, so I haven't got a great while to tramp 'round," [...] he said to himself, and just <b>at</b> that moment <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> a {{neighboring}} steeple struck the hour of eight.|$|R
6000|$|... "A mere coincidence, no doubt," [...] said Mary, {{brushing}} Mrs. Wimbush {{out of the}} conversation. [...] "There's a {{very good}} train at 3.27." [...] She looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantelpiece. [...] "You'll have nice time to pack." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a glance}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the wall opposite, {{he went into}} Number Four. The sound of the closing door was heard, {{the sound of the}} turning lock {{followed}} it. Then the dead silence fell over the house once more.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE (glancing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantel). I haven't {{got time}} to tell you,--I'm afraid I couldn't make it clear, anyway,--it isn't clear {{in my own mind}} yet. But,--go slow with this labour business, dad, there's {{dynamite}} in it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought that}} women were wearisome creatures after all {{presented}} itself to his fatigued brain. But he was too generous to harbour {{it for more than}} an instant. This man, hurt cruelly in his vanity, remained magnanimous in his conduct, allowing himself no satisfaction of a bitter smile or of a contemptuous gesture. With true greatness of soul, he only glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wooden <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, and said in a perfectly calm but forcible manner: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Aline {{that on this}} {{particular}} afternoon a strange dumbness had descended on her. She {{had been unable to}} speak to George and now she could not think of anything to say to Freddie. She looked at him and he looked <b>at</b> her; and <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel-piece went on ticking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy, I {{have to be}} going," [...] she exclaimed, glancing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black marble <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel. [...] "We've {{got a lot of}} {{invoices}} to {{put through}} to-day. See you again, Mr. Holder." [...] She jerked his hand once more. [...] "Good morning, Mr. Bentley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Sandgate kindly warned me, and," [...] her {{companion}} saw as he glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the chimney, [...] "I've only ten minutes, at best. The 'Journal' won't {{have been good}} for him," [...] he added--"you doubtless have seen the 'Journal'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{went on and}} on, in her brain; {{there was}} no end to it; no way to undo the snarl that life had tangled itself up into. She looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantel, {{and saw that it}} was three o'clock. [...] "Why don't you go to bed?" [...] she asked Charmian.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me that we have arrived at what is called an impasse in French." [...] He looked up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the wall, and she gave a little jump in her chair. [...] "Oh, there's plenty of time. The taxi won't be here for half an hour yet. Is there any heat left in that coffee?" ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{exterior}} {{view of the}} Temple Building, {{the first}} Los Angeles County Court House, ca. 1880. Located on East Main Street one block north of Temple Street, the building is bounded by Spring Street, Main Street, Court Street and Market Street; this is {{a view of the}} Spring Street side. Vendors are set up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of the building under cover of temporary awnings. Horse-drawn carriages are seen <b>at</b> right. <b>The</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower shows the time to be 11 : 10. Legible signs include: "Gore & Stradley [ [...] . ] Shoes". Writing on one image reads "Old Court House 1885 [...] . ". The building was built in 1859 by John Temple and rented to the County and to vendors who leased store space...|$|R
5000|$|John Lee Hooker {{recorded}} the song as [...] "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" [...] in 1966. Hooker transformed Milburn's song [...] "into {{a vehicle for}} himself". He used the storyline and chorus (but altered the order), but [...] "edited the verse down to its essentials, filled in the gaps with narrative and dialogue, and set the whole thing to a rocking cross between South Side shuffle and signature boogie". [...] Part of Hooker's narrative included: And then I sit there, drinkin', gettin' high, mellow, knocked out, feelin' goodAbout that time I looked on <b>the</b> wall, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wallAbout {{that time it was}} ten-thirty then, I looked down <b>the</b> bar <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bartender, he said'What do you want, Johnny?', one bourbon, one scotch, and one beer ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{rolling her}} sleeves above her pretty arms, she mixed a {{cocktail}} in such delightful {{imitation of the}} fashionable barkeeper's dexterity that her guests were convulsed with admiration. Even Ira was struck with this revelation of a youthfulness that five years of household care had checked, but never yet subdued. He had forgotten that he had married a child. Only once, when she glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cheap <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel, had he noticed another change, more remarkable still from its very inconsistency with her burst of youthful spirits. It was another face that he saw,--older and matured with an intensity of abstraction that struck a chill to his heart. It was not HIS Sue that was standing there, but another Sue, wrought, as it seemed to his morbid extravagance, by some one else's hand.|$|R
60|$|Supposing he didn't ask her again! What {{should she}} do? She looked up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> {{the front of}} the pub, and noticed that it only wanted five minutes to the half-hour. How terrible it would be if the brake started and he didn't ask her! Her heart beat violently against her chest, and in her {{agitation}} she fumbled with the corner of her apron.|$|E
6000|$|Mitchy took it {{with his}} highest light. [...] "I know from your taking the trouble to {{remember}} that, how much what I've said of him pleases and touches you. We're a little sort of religion then, you and I; we're an organisation of two, at any rate, and we can't help ourselves. There--that's settled." [...] He glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the chimney. [...] "But what's the matter with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ay, your highness, {{and with}} unlooked-for sympathy,’ {{returned}} the young man. ‘I know not {{how to tell}} the change that has befallen me. You have, I must suppose, a charm, to which even your enemies are subject.’ He looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> the mantelpiece and visibly blanched. ‘So late!’ he cried. ‘Your highness—God knows I am now speaking from the heart—before it be too late, leave this house!’ ...|$|E
60|$|The time flew. Her {{presence}} {{was like a}} bracing, tingling atmosphere in which I felt revived and exhilarated, self-restored. For Nancy did not question--she took me as I was. We {{looked out on the}} world, as it were, from the same window, and I could not help thinking that ours, after all, was a large view. The topics didn't matter--our conversation was fragrant with intimacy; and we were so close to each other it seemed incredible that we ever should be parted again. <b>At</b> last <b>the</b> little <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel chimed an hour, she started and looked up.|$|R
6000|$|We tried {{all sorts}} of subjects, but they dropped one after the other. The elder gentlemen seemed {{to be afraid of}} {{committing}} themselves by talking too freely within hearing of us juniors, and we, on our side, restrained our youthful flow of spirits and youthful freedom of conversation out of deference to our host, who seemed once or twice to be feeling a little nervous about the continued propriety of our behavior in the presence of his respectable guests. To make matters worse, we had dined at a sensible hour. When the bottles made their first round <b>at</b> dessert, <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mantel-piece only struck eight. I counted the strokes, and felt certain, from the expression of his face, that the other junior guest, who sat on one side of me <b>at</b> <b>the</b> round table, was counting them also. When we came to the final eight, we exchanged looks of despair. [...] "Two hours more of this! What on earth is to become of us?" [...] In the language of the eyes, that was exactly what we said to each other.|$|R
40|$|Melvil Dewey {{was born}} on December 10, 1851 on the tenth day of the tenth month. * To this fact I {{attribute}} the reason why Dewey conceived his idea of using Arabic numerals decimally to mark the subjects of books. I call this, happily, the "birthday theory. " At this early hour you may not embrace this theory. Perhaps you will find more to your liking the "digital-clock-on-the-bar theory. " Parched by a long prayer meeting, Dewey repaired to a local tavern to restore his depleted spirits. While staring over his beer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar, he conceived his decimal plan. Fortunately, he had stared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>clock</b> after one o'clock, but before ten, and when the hour did not change. This theory has two known flaws: Dewey did not drink, and digital clocks were not then found on bars or anywhere. I sense your reluctance to embrace this theory as well. Nevertheless, {{there are only two}} or three views regarding Dewey's conception that are better than the "birthday theory" or the "digital-clock-on-the-bar theory. " None has been proposed that is worse, however, so I withdraw both. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
