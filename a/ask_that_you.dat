5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

500|$|President Lincoln {{learned of}} Frémont's {{proclamation}} by reading {{it in the}} newspaper. [...] Disturbed by Frémont's actions, Lincoln felt that emancipation was [...] "not {{within the range of}} military law or necessity" [...] and that such powers rested only with the elected federal government. [...] Lincoln also recognized the monumental political problem that such an edict posed to his efforts to keep the border states in the Union. [...] He was particularly worried about reports he heard of the furor in Kentucky over the edict, writing, [...] "I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game." [...] According to Lincoln in a letter to a supporter of Frémont, a unit of Kentucky militia fighting for the Union, upon hearing of Frémont's proclamation, threw down their weapons and disbanded. Lincoln determined the proclamation could not be allowed to remain in force. However, to override the edict or to directly order Frémont to strike out or modify the paragraph had its own political dangers—such an act would outrage abolitionists throughout the North. [...] Sensitive to the political pitfalls on all sides, Lincoln wrote to Frémont, [...] "Allow me to therefore <b>ask,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will, as of your own motion, modify that paragraph..." ...|$|E

Horton, which called it [...] "a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it." [...] Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of [...] "movies that critics got wrong" [...] calling it [...] "a cult classic in the making". It was described as [...] "nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go" [...] by Alejandro Stepenberg from JoBlo.com, while Slates Chris Wade named it [...] "an underrated masterpiece," [...] stating [...] "they [...] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> take it seriously." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an [...] "unsung masterpiece"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes. Tor.com's Dexter Palmer considered {{the possibility that the}} film is a [...] "misunderstood art film", highlighting its color scheme that is a [...] "pleasure" [...] and the fact it does not try to seem real. Palmer lauded it because he does not think films must imitate reality, and ultimately said it is [...] "an extreme reminder of what films, and especially fantasy and science fiction films, can place on screen" [...] and that it is [...] "a refreshing change of pace" [...] in film industry. Collider's Kayti Burt ranked it at #30 of Best Hollywood Blockbusters of the 21st Century stating, [...] "While other blockbusters of the year (and the decade) worked to ground their fantastical premises in a gritty, realistic setting, Speed Racer leaned hard in the other direction." ...|$|E

In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous.
