5000|$|Tactile Programming: (1996) AgentSheets {{becomes the}} world's first drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> {{educational}} programming environment. Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> interfaces {{can be used}} to compose syntactically correct programs. In Visual AgenTalk (VAT), a rule-based visual programming language, users create rules by dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> conditions <b>and</b> actions from palettes. The tactile aspect of Visual AgenTalk allows users to perceive through drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> what programs do. By dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> conditions, actions, rules and even methods onto agents they see the consequence of invoking program fragment without having to write a test program. Similar drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> programming can later be found in the Etoys language (part of Squeak), in Alice and in Scratch.|$|R

40|$|Drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> {{operation}} {{is one of}} the key capabilities of any Graphical User Interface. The user can do quite complex operations simply by visually dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> objects from one location to another. It saves user from remembering and typing a lot of commands. The result of a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation may vary depending the type of source object and type of destination object. For example dragging a file <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> on a folder may copy or move the file to the destination folder, dropping that file to a remote FTP location may upload that file using internet, dropping that file on a printer icon may print that file, dropping that file on the trash can may delete that file, <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> that file on an executable may play or open or compute or manipulate that file. Although a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation prima facie seems to be a simple operation, it can become extremely complicated depending on the type of source objects dragged and the type of destination objects selected for dropping. There are many limitations of a conventional drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation. This article points out the difficulties of a drag <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> operation <b>and</b> illustrates the solutions disclosed by various inventions to overcome those difficulties.
