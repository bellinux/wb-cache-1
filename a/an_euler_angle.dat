The rate gyroscope {{is one of the}} most critical instruments used in spacecraft attitude estimation and unfortunately historical trends show this instrument degrades significantly with time. Degraded rate gyroscopes have impacted the missions for several NASA and ESA spacecraft, including the Hubble Telescope. A possible solution to this problem is using a mathematically modeled dynamic gyroscope in lieu of a real one. In this thesis, data from such a gyro is presented and integrated into a spacecraft attitude estimation algorithm. The impediment to spacecraft attitude estimation presented by imperfect sensors has been overcome by developing more accurate sensors and using Kalman filters to reduce the effect of noisy measurements. Kalman filters for spacecraft attitude estimation have historically been based on <b>an</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>angle</b> or quaternion formulation.

Even with {{recent advances in}} computing power the development of smaller Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and sophisticated sensor payloads with high data rates can still challenge on-board computer resources.

Measurement updates are provided by an external machine-vision infrared tracking system.

40|$|We {{have given}} a novel {{formulation}} of the exact solutions for the lambda, vee and cascade three-level systems where the Hamiltonian of each configuration is expressed in the SU(3) basis. The solutions are discussed {{from the perspective of}} the Bloch equation and the atom-field entanglement scenario. For the semiclassical systems, the Bloch space structure of each configuration is studied by solving the corresponding Bloch equation and it is shown that at resonance, the eight-dimensional Bloch sphere is broken up into two distinct subspaces due to the existence of a pair of quadratic constants. Because of the different structure of the Hamiltonian in the SU(3) basis, the non-linear constants are found to be distinct for different configurations. We propose a possible representation of the qutrit wave function and show its equivalence with the three-level system. Taking the bichromatic cavity modes to be in the coherent state, the amplitudes of all three quantized systems are calculated by developing <b>an</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>angle</b> based dressed state scheme.

40|$|Descriptions of {{shoulder}} kinematics during wheelchair propulsion {{are limited}} to motions of the upper arm due {{to the difficulty of}} measuring scapular movement in vivo. Using a digitizing stylus, the three-dimensional positions of three anatomical landmarks on the scapula were recorded for 10 manual wheelchair users in six different statically held hand positions (- 30 °, - 15 °, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 60 °) on the pushrim. In each hand position, a motion analysis system recorded the coordinates of infrared markers on the arm and torso. Scapular, humeral, and torso angles were computed using <b>an</b> <b>Euler</b> <b>angle</b> decomposition method for each position relative to the torso. At the beginning of the push, the scapula was rotated slightly upward (1. 5 °), minimally protracted (15 °), and maximally tipped forward (22 °). In addition, the humerus was maximally extended, abducted and internally rotated. As subjects moved forward along the pushrim, the protraction angle increased while the forward tipping angle decreased. The humerus became increasingly more flexed as the push progressed with small changes observed in humeral abduction and internal rotation. A stepwise multiple regression analysis procedure (p < 0. 01) revealed that the torso, humeral flexion/extension and abduction angles are good predictors for estimating forward tipping and upward/downward rotation of the scapula. The regression equations enable researchers to estimate scapular orientation during propulsion which could provide further insight into specific biomechanical factors that lead to shoulder pathology...|$|E
