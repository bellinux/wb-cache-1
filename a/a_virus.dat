40|$|ABSTRACT. Migratory water {{birds are}} a natural {{reservoir}} for influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses.</b> Viruses replicate in the intestines of ducks and are shed with the fecal materials. Virus isolation from collected fecal materials, therefore, {{is an integral}} part of the surveillance of avian influenza in water birds. In the present study, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was assessed for its use-fulness in detecting the RNA of influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> in fecal materials. It was found that, RT-LAMP specifically and sensitively detects the matrix gene of influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses.</b> Influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> were isolated from the fecal materials in which viral RNA were detected by RT-LAMP in 35 min. The present findings indicate that RT-LAMP is useful as a high throughput screening method for field samples prior to virus isolation, allowing the processing of hundreds of samples per day.

40|$|AbstractQuail {{have emerged}} as a {{potential}} intermediate host in the spread of avian influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> in poultry in Hong Kong. To better understand this possible role, we tested the replication and transmission in quail of influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> of all 15 HA subtypes. Quail supported the replication of at least 14 subtypes. Influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> replicated predominantly in the respiratory tract. Transmission experiments suggested that perpetuation of avian influenza viruses in quail requires adaptation. Swine influenza viruses were isolated from the respiratory tract of quail at low levels. There {{was no evidence of}} human influenza <b>A</b> or B <b>virus</b> replication. Interestingly, <b>a</b> human–avian recombinant containing the surface glycoprotein genes of <b>a</b> quail <b>virus</b> and the internal genes of <b>a</b> human <b>virus</b> replicated and transmitted readily in quail; therefore, quail could function as amplifiers of influenza virus reassortants that have the potential to infect humans and/or other mammalian species...|$|R

40|$|Influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{amongst the}} most {{challenging}} viruses that threaten both human and animal health. Influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> are unique in many ways. Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect. This includes waterfowl (the original reservoir), terrestrial and aquatic poultry, swine, humans, horses, dog, cats, whales, seals and several other mammalian species. Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species. Finally, they are unique {{in the frequency of}} inter-species transmission events that occur. Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza <b>virus</b> strain in <b>an</b> immunologically naïve population can be devastating. The problems that influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> present for human and animal health are numerous. For example, influenza <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses.
