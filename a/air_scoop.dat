5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
25|$|The 1953 {{model year}} brought minor {{changes to the}} Hudson Hornet.

25|$|The {{installation}} of the 150hp (112kW) Royal Aircraft Factory 4a air-cooled V12 engine closely resembled that of the B.E.12, with the same large <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> and similar vertically mounted exhausts protruding over the upper wing to carry the fumes clear of the crew. The only real difference was that the engine was slightly raked back, to improve {{take off and landing}} characteristics.|$|E
500|$|Rootes {{entered the}} Tiger in European rallies, taking first, {{second and third}} places in the 1964 Geneva Rally. Two Tigers {{took part in the}} 1965 Monte Carlo Rally, one {{finishing}} fourth overall, the highest placing by a front-engined rear-wheel drive car, and the other eleventh. After finally having sorted out the engine overheating problem by fitting a forward-facing <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> to the bonnet, Rootes entered three Tigers in the 1965 Alpine Rally, one of which crossed the finishing line as outright winner. Scrutineers later disqualified the car however, because it had been fitted with undersized cylinder head valves. By the end of the 1966 Acropolis Rally though, it had become clear that low-slung sports cars such as the Tiger were unsuited to the increasingly rough-terrain rally stages, and the car was withdrawn from competition soon after. In the words of Ian Hall, who drove the Tiger in the Acropolis Rally, [...] "I felt that the Tiger had just had it– it was an out of date leviathan".|$|E
2500|$|In February 1965, Cessna {{introduced}} the Model 337 Super Skymaster. The model was larger, {{and had more}} powerful engines, retractable landing gear, and a dorsal <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> for the rear engine. (The [...] "Super" [...] prefix was subsequently dropped from the name.) In 1966, the turbocharged T337 was introduced, and in 1973, the pressurized P337G entered production.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{development}} of the Merlin 61/63/66 and 70 series engines, with a two-stage, two-speed supercharger requiring an intercooler, several important modifications were made to the basic airframe and applied to all aircraft powered by these engines. The longer Merlin 61 meant the nose forward of the engine/fuel tank bulkhead was 7inches (17.8cm) longer. An intercooler was mounted behind the engine, on the supercharger casing.

25|$|Its {{appearance}} is slightly different from its sister-car, the Porsche 911 (997) Turbo, {{in a few}} ways. It does not have fog lights in the front bumper, it has a revised front lip, it has a larger rear wing (with two small <b>air</b> <b>scoops</b> on either side), {{and it has a}} different rear bumper (now featuring titanium exhaust pipes).|$|R
5000|$|Falcon XR8 Sequential sedan (EL-series): {{powered by}} a {{modified}} 200+kW 5.0-Litre V8 engine, its key feature was a Harrop-engineered and built sequential shift transmission; it also received a re-trimmed leather interior, upgraded brakes and suspension, 19-inch alloy wheels, twin bonnet <b>air</b> <b>scoops</b> and Mexican Fire paint that changed from gold to red depending on light conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{the wings}} and {{fuselage}} were built using new construction methods that built sections as complete assemblies rather than riveting together many individual parts. The aircraft has far fewer rivets that contemporary designs.

2500|$|The LFA body {{features}} {{sharp edges}} and cutoffs for improved aerodynamic performance, {{made possible by}} the carbon fiber body. The body was designed with an emphasis on downforce. [...] There are air scoops located over the rear fenders which feed the aft-mounted radiators and help cool the brakes. A horizontal hood gap also feeds air to the engine. Two small aft vents expel air that is collected by an underbody <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> and used to cool the titanium exhaust pipes. [...] Dual hood ducts serve to move hot air away from the exhaust manifold.|$|E
2500|$|Curtiss {{engineers}} {{worked to}} improve the XP-40's speed by moving the radiator forward in steps. Seeing little gain, Kelsey ordered the aircraft to be evaluated in a NACA wind tunnel to identify solutions for better aerodynamic qualities. From 28 March to 11 April 1939, the prototype was studied by NACA. Based on the data obtained, Curtiss moved the glycol coolant radiator forward to the chin; its new <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> also accommodated the oil cooler air intake. Other improvements to the landing gear doors and the exhaust manifold combined to give performance that was satisfactory to the USAAC. Without beneficial tail winds, Kelsey flew the XP-40 from Wright Field back to Curtiss's plant in Buffalo at an average speed of [...] Further tests in December 1939 proved the fighter could reach [...]|$|E
2500|$|For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was {{completely}} redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac) Oldsmobile {{continued to use}} a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame. The 98 shared its appearance with the Oldsmobile 88. Oldsmobile stayed with its top series format by offering four body styles on an exclusive [...] wheelbase. Standard equipment included oil filter, turn signals, <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> brakes, Safety spectrum speedometer, rocker panel moldings, special emblems, parking brake light, sponge vinyl headliner, deep twist carpeting, electric clock, wheel trim moldings, power steering, power brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic Drive.

2500|$|The first A-36A (42-83663) was {{rolled out}} of the NAA Inglewood plant in September 1942, rapidly going through flight testing with the first flight in October, with {{deliveries}} commencing soon after of the first production machines. The A-36A continued the use of nose-mounted [...]50in (12.7mm) machine guns along with wing armament of four [...]50in (12.7mm) caliber machine guns. The USAAF envisaged that the dive bomber would operate mainly at altitudes below 12,000ft (3,658m) and specified {{the use of a}} sea level-rated Allison V-1710-87, driving a 10ft 9in (3.28m)-diameter three bladed Curtiss-Electric propeller and delivering 1,325hp (988kW) at 3,000ft (914m). The main <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> inlet was redesigned to become a fixed unit with a larger opening, replacing the earlier scoop which could be lowered into the airstream. In addition the A-36 carburetor air intake was later fitted with a tropical air filter to stop sand and grit being ingested into the engine.|$|E

The windscreen was now flat bullet-resistant glass to avoid optical distortion, a change from the curved Plexiglas windscreens with the internal plate glass of the earlier Corsairs. Vought also tested the two F4U-4Xs (BuNos 49763 and 50301, prototypes for the new R2800) with fixed wing-tip tanks (the Navy showed no interest) and an Aeroproducts six-blade contraprop (not accepted for production).|$|E
2500|$|The Plaxton coach range which {{appeared}} at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first window bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the <b>air</b> <b>scoop</b> at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and {{gave the impression of}} size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9" [...] circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.|$|E
50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{was added}} to the engine to lift power from 100 kW to 193 kW. The body was made from fibreglass, with carbon fibre panels and numerous <b>air</b> <b>scoops</b> leading to the engine bay.
