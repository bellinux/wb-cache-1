It was named the 14th best {{album of the year}} by both NME magazine and Christgau in his list for The Barnes & Noble Review. However, the magazine XLR8R ranked the album number seven on their list of the most overrated releases of the year, feeling that the trio's dark and minimal sound on the record was not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> on their debut LP.|$|E

Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences. From succulent coconut-milk and curry rich Minangkabau cuisine to Oceanian seafood meal of Papuan and Ambonese cuisine. Embarked on a journey through Indonesian cuisine is <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> enjoying the diversity of Indonesian culture, as some kind of dishes might have myriad variations of different recipes across archipelago.|$|E

500|$|... "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christopher Connelly, {{a writer for}} Rolling Stone, described [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] as being Thrillers [...] "most combative track". Connelly noted that in the [...] "hyperactive" [...] song, Jackson's [...] "emotions are so raw that the song nearly goes out of control". He further commented that the song has a [...] "tune that's almost <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> seeing Jackson motivate himself across a concert stage – {{and a lot more}} unpredictable". Remarking that while the song's lyrics [...] "won't keep Elvis Costello awake nights [...] ", they [...] "do show that Jackson has progressed past the hey-let's-hustle sentiments that dominated Off the Wall". He added that Jackson's [...] "raw ability and conviction make material like", citing [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin", as well as other of Thrillers songs, [...] "into first-class cuts".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] was re-issued on Region 1 DVD {{as part of}} A Video's release The Best of Thunderbirds: The Favorite Episodes, whose {{content was}} {{selected}} {{based on the results}} of a fan poll hosted on the A website. Reviewing the product for DVD Verdict, David Gutierrez awarded [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] a grade of 95 (out of 100), commending the episode for the rescue itself (considered [...] "amazing") and adding: [...] "Television rarely has moments <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the Fireflash attempting a forced landing." [...] Stuart Galbraith IV of the DVD Talk website characterised the plot as [...] "sort of an airborne version of Speed". In a BBC Online review of the 2003 Thunderbirds soundtrack album, Morag Reavley commented positively on composer Barry Gray's incidental piece [...] "Fireflash Landing", stating that it is one of several [...] "catchy, pulse-quickening tunes" [...] that [...] "come fast and furious".|$|E
500|$|In April 1958 Fleming {{flew to the}} Seychelles via Bombay {{to report}} for The Sunday Times on a {{treasure}} hunt; although the hunt was not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> he hoped, Fleming used many {{of the details of}} the island for [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity". Fleming combined the backdrop of the Seychelles with his experience he and Blanche Blackwell had undergone when they had visited Pedro Keys, two islands off Jamaica, and watched two scientists do something similar with poison to obtain samples. For the villain of the story, an abusive American millionaire, Fleming used the name Milton Krest: Milton was the code name of a Greek sea captain who ferried British soldiers and agents through German patrols and who received the Distinguished Service Order and an MBE, whilst Krest was the name of tonic and ginger beer Fleming drank in Seychelles. [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity" [...] was first published in Playboy in March 1960.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} of Scarface was troubled from the start. The Hays office warned Howard Hughes, the film's producer, {{not to make}} the film. He ignored their pleas telling Hawks: [...] "Screw the Hays Office. Start the picture and make it as realistic, <b>as</b> <b>exciting,</b> <b>as</b> grisly as possible." [...] When the film was completed in late 1931, the Hays office demanded numerous changes, including a conclusion where Camonte was captured, tried, convicted, and hung, and demanded the film carry the subtitle Shame of a Nation. Hughes sent the picture to numerous state censorship boards, saying that he hoped to show the film was made to combat the [...] "gangster menace". After failing to get the film past the New York State censor board (then headed by Wingate) even after the changes, Hughes decided to release the movie in a version close to its original form. When other local censors refused to release the edited version, the Hays Office sent Jason Joy around to ensure them that the cycle of gangster films of this nature was coming to an end.|$|E
500|$|John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success, with {{over one million}} copies sold. It has been cited as the highest-selling game developed by Looking Glass Studios, and Neurath later called it [...] "one {{of the most successful}} games I've ever worked on". Paul Mellerick of Mega commented that [...] "the only noticeable difference between [...] and its two predecessors is the animation". He wrote that this new animation [...] "makes the game incredibly good to look at" [...] and that new motions like stumbling increase the game's difficulty. Although he believed that the [...] "two-player mode is just <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> ever", he was disappointed by the lack of a full-season mode, which he called [...] "unforgivable" [...] in light of this feature's appearance in Sega's NFL Sports Talk Football '93. He concluded that John Madden Football '93 was [...] "the best game the Mega Drive has to offer", but he wrote, [...] "If you own John Madden Football '92, or even the original John Madden American Football for that matter, then you should ignore this game completely".|$|E
500|$|... "Follow Me Home" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic {{described it as}} an [...] "aptly pitched inspirational mini-epic", while Stylus Magazine's Nick Southall complimented the song's [...] "luscious, romantic strings." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC noted the song as having a near-level standard of the group's 2003 single, [...] "Too Lost in You". QX gave the song seven out of ten stars, writing: [...] "With this film themed track they’re staying true to their roots and retain their position as leaders amidst the all-girl band rankings". Stuart Heritage of Hecklerspray wrote that the song [...] "benefits from some lovely strings and gorgeous, sultry vocals", although admitted that the single is not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the album's previous ones. Daily Records Rick Fulton described the song {{as one of the}} group's more thoughtful tracks, but admitted that it lacks [...] "bite". He applauded the Soul Seekerz Vocal Mix version as [...] "breathing life" [...] into it. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian criticised the song as tedious and stated that it [...] "is every bit as gripping as new parents foisting their baby photos on you". Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie considered it [...] "nothing special".|$|E

500|$|Chris Carabott of IGN gave a 9.3 out of 10 to [...] "I Do", {{describing}} it as [...] "delivering some key {{moments in the}} series' history and leaving viewers with a spectacular cliffhanger ending." [...] Carabott complimented Locke's scenes as [...] "short but nonetheless powerful" [...] and praised Matthew Fox's acting, saying he [...] "steals the show {{with one of his}} best performances to date". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christine Fenno considered that the flashbacks [...] "weren't <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the action on the island, but they were full of fun details" [...] and liked Jack's scenes at the operating room. Jonathan Toomey of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "I Do" [...] "an episode worthy of being called a mid-season finale", thinking that the romantic scenes between Kate and Sawyer worked for [...] "the tension that existed". [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl considered [...] "I Do" [...] as [...] "a worthy end to Lost's truncated Fall season", having a good reaction to the cliffhanger and saying the episode [...] "set up incredible possibilities {{for the rest of the}} season". Not all reviews were positive, with Slant Magazines critic Andrew Dignan feeling it was [...] "lacking both the immediacy and urgency that keeps viewers clamoring for months on end", and being critical of the writing, particularly on most of the essential plot elements occurring in the final minutes.|$|E
500|$|... "Existence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". While offering a positive opinion {{in regards to}} the finale as a whole, he felt that [...] "Existence" [...] dragged more so than [...] "Essence", resulting in a less interesting episode. He also felt that the overarching mythology of the series had long ago become too convoluted to make sense, but that the [...] "human pieces of the show still work, and that includes Doggett." [...] Contra Costa Times columnists George Avalos and Michael Liedtke were pleased with the episode noting that the last scene was [...] "beautifully written". Avalos and Liedtke also reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene in the episode. Despite their praise, however, they stressed that [...] "Existence" [...] was not <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the previous episode, [...] "Essence," [...] or the 1998 The X-Files feature film. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating, noting that [...] "season eight's finale goes out with a big fat juicy kiss between Mulder and Scully, at long last". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on".|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{agreed that}} the {{religious}} imagery was a calculated move by Gaga to create controversy. Simon Voxick-Levinson from Entertainment Weekly felt that the move was calculated, saying, [...] "Gaga wants to offend people. She's a provocateur. Gaga would probably be disappointed if no one was offended by her latest video. She's doing that stuff for a reason." [...] He {{did not think that}} the risks were very original or <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the ones in [...] "Telephone." [...] "The risks that she was taking [...] were easier targets [...] It's a little bit been there, done that," [...] he said. The New York Timess Jon Caramanica thought the controversy was Gaga's attempt to take the [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] throne. He said, [...] ""I'm sure she'd say she loves Madonna ... but I also think she's saying, 'This [...] is mine.' And also, like, 'I'm murdering you with my own style. I've learned this. I know how to do this ... And look how flawlessly I do it.'" [...] He did feel, however, that the religious imagery was obvious and lazy: [...] "Even the worst provocation is going to succeed. She got what she wanted." [...] Singer Katy Perry took to her Twitter account and wrote, [...] "Using blasphemy as entertainment is as cheap as a comedian telling fart jokes." [...] The Huffington Post ascertained that while Gaga had not been mentioned directly by name that it was definitely a slam by Perry towards Lady Gaga. In an interview on NRJ Radio's Le 6/9, Perry said that the tweet was not solely about Gaga, stating that it was based on her personal views of religion.|$|E

500|$|In The New Yorker, Penelope Gilliatt {{said it was}} [...] "some kind {{of great}} film, and an unforgettable endeavor... The film is hypnotically entertaining, and it is funny without once being gaggy, {{but it is also}} rather harrowing." [...] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was [...] "the picture that science fiction fans of every age and in every corner of the world have prayed (sometimes forlornly) that the {{industry}} might some day give them. It is an ultimate statement of the science fiction film, an awesome realization of the spatial future... it is a milestone, a landmark for a spacemark, in the art of film." [...] Louise Sweeney of The Christian Science Monitor felt that 2001 was [...] "a brilliant intergalactic satire on modern technology. It's also a dazzling 160-minute tour on the Kubrick filmship through the universe out there beyond our earth." [...] Philip French wrote that the film was [...] "perhaps the first multi-million-dollar supercolossal movie since D.W. Griffith's Intolerance fifty years ago which can be regarded as the work of one man...Space Odyssey is important as the high-water mark of science-fiction movie making, or at least of the genre's futuristic branch." [...] The Boston Globe's review indicated that it was [...] "the world's most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before or, for that matter, anywhere... The film is <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the discovery of a new dimension in life." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars in his original review, believing the film [...] "succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale." [...] He later put it on his Top 10 list for Sight & Sound. Time provided at least seven different mini-reviews of the film in various issues in 1968, each one slightly more positive than the preceding one; in the final review dated December 27, 1968, the magazine called 2001 [...] "an epic film about the history and future of mankind, brilliantly directed by Stanley Kubrick. The special effects are mindblowing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Akron Beacon-Journal {{declared}} [...] "the lieutenant governor's role in Columbus {{is typically}} about <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> drywall," [...] as the lieutenant governor's job carries no duties except what the Governor assigns, the chief {{function of the}} office now being to provide a successor to the Governor. The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Republican paper, editorialized [...] "Johnson and Bradley seem to be good choices for these jobs. However, the way they got the posts points out again that Ohio is clearly dominated by one political party, a situation we do not think is healthy for the state, no matter which party is in control." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uglow's {{depiction}} of scientific thought {{has also been}} praised; A. S. Byatt, for example, describes The Lunar Men as [...] "full of [...] the real sense that scientific curiosity is <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> any 'artistic' pursuit." [...] Her discussion of art has gained a more mixed reception. The New York Times art critic Michael Kimmelman complains that Uglow overvalues Hogarth's paintings and neglects his artistic associates in favour of his literary ones. On the other hand, Helen Macdonald, reviewing Nature's Engraver, considers that it is [...] "in her descriptions of the physical process of artistic creation, and her musings on individual engravings, that Uglow is at her most energetic and fluid." ...|$|E

2500|$|With It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, {{the group}} {{set out to}} make what they {{considered}} to be the hip hop equivalent to Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, an album noted for its strong social commentary. As said by Chuck, [...] "our mission was to kill the 'Cold Gettin' Dumb' stuff and really address some situations." [...] In order to ensure that their live shows would be <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> those they played in London and Philadelphia, the group decided that the music on Nation of Millions would have to be faster than that found on Yo! Bum Rush the Show. [...] "Years of saved-up ideas," [...] noted Chuck, [...] "were compiled into one focussed aural missile." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand run chase {{was every}} bit <b>as</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> {{it had been in}} the first match. [...] Nathan Astle {{followed}} up his 70 runs in the first match with just 11, beaten by the bowling of Australian speedster Brett Lee. Sinclair was the next to go, scoring 17 runs before edging a Jason Gillespie ball to Hayden in the slips. This was the beginning of a New Zealand collapse, with Scott Styris the next to depart with 5 runs, and then Stephen Fleming who had successfully taken on Lee, scoring 34 runs from 44 balls, falling to Brad Hogg's first delivery, given out LBW. Jacob Oram then fell for two runs, followed by Hamish Marshall for just 9, the latter falling victim to a quick ball from Lee which took his off stump.|$|E
2500|$|Magnétophone's albums, 7"s and 12"s are {{visually}} impressive objects.

The very first single, 'You Should Write Music' consisted of a red audiophile-weight vinyl 7", with a matching textured sleeve and a single white sticker, containing the band name and track titles. Their work with V23's design-icon Vaughan Oliver and photographer/designer Chris Bigg has produced some unique sleeves, from the three-quarter cut-sleeved, double vinyl lp of 'I Guess Sometimes...', to the laser cut aluminium turntable pillar-disc that accompanied the CD version of the same LP, to the high quality cardboard, gate-folding digipack of 'The Man Who Ate The Man' which contained eight small double-sided cards, printed with domestic interior images and cryptic phrases.|$|E
