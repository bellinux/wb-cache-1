5|$|Automobile <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> were {{commonly}} {{fitted with}} fusible plugs, operating at 100–110°C, but from {{concerns about the}} environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E

5|$|Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in {{informal}} contexts, {{are identified}} by R-numbers that denote {{the amount of}} fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) like R-11, R-12, and R-114 once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems,</b> propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, chlorodifluoromethane, and R-141b. The main HFC is R-134a with {{a new type of}} molecule HFO-1234yf, a Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its global warming potential of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were put}} back into service on 13 July. The trains were only allowed {{to operate at}} {{conventional}} speeds and {{had to go through}} a weekly inspection. At the same time, NSB removed the surcharge on the Signatur services. NSB stated that they were considering revocation the purchase of the four trains which were still to be delivered. In addition to problems with axles, there were also issues with the braking and <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems.</b> In mid-August, the tilting mechanism was disabled on all the trains because of a fault in a bearing in the connection between the bogie and the body which allowed for a movement of several millimetres (at least 0.1 in). In late August, problems occurred with the braking system causing the trains to automatically brake even when not receiving such signals from the automatic train stop system.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{reactions}} involved in Bynesian decay require a certain quantity of {{moisture in the}} air {{in order for them to}} take place, keeping the air somewhat dry, i.e. keeping the environmental relative humidity under control is beneficial. This is achieved by careful monitoring of the relative humidity (using instruments such as a hygrometer), and applying dehumidifiers when necessary; sometimes, simple <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>systems</b> may suffice. Extremely low humidity can damage some specimens, so caution is recommended. Usually, a relative humidity maintained around 50% is considered to be adequate. Applying sorbents containing a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, inside the storage environment to protect the specimens against degradation is also possible. Copy paper or KOH-impregnated filter paper are some low cost examples of sorbents which can be used. These strong bases have a preference to react with acid, thus they compete successfully with the calcium carbonate specimens for any acidic vapors that may be present. The bases also help reduce the overall acid concentration inside the enclosed space.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to design and briefly investigate the cooling performances of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> for a special purpose vehicle under various experimental conditions. An <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> with two parallel refrigeration cycles consisting of two compressors and two condensers for satisfying the required cooling performance of the special purpose vehicle was tested under extremely hot weather conditions and high thermal load conditions and then optimized by varying the refrigerant charge amount. The optimum refrigerant charge amount of the tested <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> was 1200 g with the consideration of the cooling speed and cooling capacity. The indoor temperatures of the suggested <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> at the refrigerant charge amounts of 1200 g, 1400 g, and 1600 g were 24. 7 °C, 25. 2 °C, and 26. 4 °C, respectively, at the elapsed time of 300 s. The cooling time required to reach a 15. 0 °C  inner temperature in the suggested <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> increased by 13. 3 % with the decrease of the refrigerant charge amount from 1600 g to 1200 g. The cooling capacity and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the suggested <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> increased by 37. 9 % and 10. 9 %, respectively, due to a decrease of the refrigerant charge amount from 1600 g to 1200 g.

Considering overall energy consumption of the building, <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> plays an important role. This thesis provides a survey of World Trade Center, central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> and possibility of energy saving through the new technology. Through my preliminary studies it has been observed that condenser water pumps, chilled water pumps and cooling towers in central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> do not require operating at the design speed all the time. Considering complexity of the central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> further detailed process studies have to be done to optimize the condenser water and chilled water systems. Equipment of the central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> is studied here and check the energy saving potential. Established new parameter measuring points of the central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> includes pressure, temperature and flow measurements. Evaluated periodical logged data, machines designed parameters, related theories & new methodologies and by that mathematical models of the parameters of the main facilities are established. For the electricity powers saving through optimization purpose system operation simulation modules of the central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> are set up by using the Matlab/Simulink tool. Through the evaluations of simulated test run results concluded central <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> optimization process, and also evaluated the measured building air quality parameters (both existing and simulated test run periods) and confirmed that the building air condition is maintaining according to the international quality standards. Finally, through the analysis to the simulated results, the optimal installation and operation scheme of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>system</b> are proposed. After the research, simulation of the proposed solutions it was observed that the condenser pump motors, chilled water pump motor and cooling towers were operating at a reduced speed at most of the time during the operation(day and night).
