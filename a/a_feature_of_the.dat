Nearby is based the Clevedon Sailing Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{gallery of}} Medals has a 40-metre-long (130ft) wall {{displaying}} around 4,000 medals, each symbolically representing 100 Victorians {{who have served}} in war and peacekeeping operations, and six who have died. <b>A</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gallery is the Victoria Cross awarded to Captain Robert Grieve during the Battle of Messines in 1917. The Cross was lent to the Shrine by Wesley College, Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing, which contributed {{greatly to}} its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, {{made up of}} five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} known whether this was <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E
5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, dancing girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E

5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations were always <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented {{local and international}} publicity, both positive and negative. Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2005, the Washington Blade {{also ran}} a free news {{clipping}} service called the BladeWire. This service collected news stories {{of interest to}} the LGBT community from a variety of local, state, regional, national, and selected international media sources. The service was generated by the Blades editors and was published on the internet. <b>A</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BladeWire also allowed it to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islands, and in 1906 {{the church was}} extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that {{within a few years}} the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E
5|$|Crimea's coastal highway {{runs through}} the park, {{dividing}} it into {{the upper and lower}} portions. The upper park is dominated by the mountain springs, {{as well as by the}} native southern coast forestry and clusters of foreign tree growth. <b>A</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper park is the Fountain of Trilby, which was placed there in 1829. The lower park is modelled upon a style called the Italian Renaissance garden. It features three pairs of Medici lions near the staircase leading up to the palace's southern façade, carved out of carrara marble by sculptor Giovanni Bonnani.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form {{at an average}} cost of £11,323 each. They were painted in the same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining that had been <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining {{along the sides of}} these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such lining for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|Music plays a {{prominent}} rôle in school life. All those entering {{the school in}} Lower Grammar (year nine) are obliged {{to learn to play}} an orchestral instrument. There are two choirs: the Chapel Choir, which sings regularly at mass, and the Schola Cantorum, composed of teachers and pupils, which sings at concerts and public events such as the May celebration in the college amphitheatre. Pupils participate in the school orchestra and various bands, whilst the staff band is <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Poetry Banquet and Rhetoric Ball.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E

Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness (including sudden sleep attacks resembling narcolepsy), disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia. REM behavior disorder (RBD), in which patients act out dreams, sometimes injuring themselves or their bed partner, may begin many years before the development of motor or cognitive features of PD or DLB.|$|E
5|$|Sylvia warblers are {{unusual in}} that they vigorously defend their territories against other members of their genus as well as conspecifics. Blackcaps and garden warblers use {{identical}} habits in the same wood, yet aggressive interactions mean that their territories never overlap. Similar songs are <b>a</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sylvia warblers as a group, {{and it has been}} suggested that this promotes interspecific competition and helps to segregate territories between related species. It appears more likely from later studies that segregation of sympatric species, other than the blackcap and garden warbler, is due to subtle habitat preferences rather than interspecies aggression.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome {{is dark and}} {{cavernous}} and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. <b>A</b> <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E
