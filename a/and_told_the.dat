5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they {{would have been able to}} hear the confrontation. O'Brien claimed that he went outside <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer. The plane was immediately stormed and Huseby arrested.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, Skelton {{was engaged}} to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had {{obtained}} a marriage license <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or reconciling with her former husband.|$|E

The chief of Ichisi cooperated fully, and {{informed}} the Spanish about the nearby paramount chief, Ocute. De Soto erected a wooden cross {{on one of the}} mounds before heading to Ocute.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{alleged that}} it {{contacted}} Warner Bros. before production began in 2005, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> studio {{that it had}} violated Fox's 1991 and 1994 deals with Gordon. Warner Bros. claimed that it was originally unaware of either deal, and that in 2005 Fox had declined to produce the Hayter screenplay that {{formed the basis of}} the production. Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros. The studio's motion to dismiss the case in August 2008 was rejected by the judge.|$|E

5|$|Hibs {{suffered}} an injury during the semi-final, when their regular goalkeeper Graham Stack {{had to be}} substituted due to a thigh injury. A scan following the match showed {{that he would be}} unable to play for between 10 and 12 weeks, and therefore would miss the final. Hibs secured their place in the Scottish Premier League with one game to spare and rested several players for the final game of their league programme. Defender Matt Doherty suffered a foot injury in that league game, but manager Pat Fenlon said he was confident Doherty would be able to play in the final. Fenlon then took his squad to his home town of Dublin to prepare for the cup final <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> media that he had almost finalised his team selection.|$|E
5|$|Mark Hoppus' {{involvement}} {{stems from}} when an Atticus Clothing employee played him I Am the Movie. He was so taken with {{it that he}} raved about the band in Rolling Stone, inviting them to open for his group, Blink-182 on their 2004 European tour. On the trek, he became good friends with the musicians. He told them that he had purchased an abundance of recording gear and amplifiers for the previous Blink-182 album <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> band of his interest in recording music from a production standpoint. At the final show of the tour, guitarist Joshua Cain went to Hoppus' dressing room {{and asked him to}} produce their next record. Although Hoppus had never produced anything before, he was excited {{to be a part of}} the album and accepted the offer.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E

5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> reporters that he had a feeling that the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted {{that it should not}} be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E

5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a reciprocity treaty with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that {{they had nothing to}} fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} to blow up the lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E
5|$|He {{utilised}} unique tactical formations, {{which earned}} him comparisons to Martin O'Neill. He was particularly experimental {{with the front}} line, and was willing to use the loan market to bring in fresh talent. On 24 March, it was announced Gannon would leave Peterborough {{at the end of}} the season. Unable to avoid relegation despite a vast upturn in results, he announced that family commitments made him unwilling to stay for longer. Gannon had been satisfied with the board's contract offer, but his family still resided in Stockport. He was replaced by Gary Johnson on 6 April, following Gannon's own recommendation of Johnson. Though Gannon insisted that this was not ultimately his decision, but instead was down to the board. Striker Liam Dickinson was sad to seem him go, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> media that Gannon would have little trouble finding a new management post.|$|E

5|$|Hilary {{attempted}} to excuse the king's attempt to exclude Theobald from the council, {{which appears to}} be the main reason why Stephen allowed Hilary to attend. Hilary was rewarded for his loyalty by being named a queen's chaplain. Soon after the council, Robert de Bethune died and Gilbert Foliot was elected to the see of Hereford, at the direction of the pope. Theobald was in exile in Flanders because he had defied the king, so the pope ordered Robert de Sigello, the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and Hilary, to go to Flanders to help Theobald consecrate Gilbert. However, the three bishops were reluctant, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> pope that because Gilbert had not received the royal assent, nor had he sworn fealty to Stephen, they would not consecrate him. Theobald then consecrated Gilbert with the help of some continental bishops. Hilary was one of the bishops who made peace between Theobald and Stephen after the council at Reims, helping in the negotiations after Theobald's return to England. Theobald settled himself at Hugh Bigod's castle of Framlingham; negotiations between the royal party and the archbishop's party resulted in the king yielding, and in the restoration of the archbishop to his lands.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Mani {{opted to}} make his next project Geethanjali, his maiden venture in Telugu. Starring Nagarjuna in the lead role, the film {{told the story of}} an ill-fated couple, both of whom are {{suffering}} from terminal diseases. Geethanjali was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990. In addition, it won the Best Director and Nandi Award for Best Story Writer for Mani. Mani maintained a momentum of making emotional stories of under-served people through the film Anjali in 1990, which starred Raghuvaran <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> story of an autistic child who changed the lives of people around her. The film proved to be a commercial success and was nominated as India's official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 63rd Academy Awards. Following Anjali's release, Mani later made another underworld-themed Tamil film, Thalapathi (1991), starring Rajinikanth and Mammootty. The film was an adaptation of Mahabharata, dealt with the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana portrayed by Rajinikanth and Mammmooty respectively. The film met with both critical acclaim and commercial success upon release. Ilaiyaraaja's musical score and Mani's work were highly appreciated as they both {{went on to win the}} Music Director and Best Director awards respectively at the 39th Filmfare Awards.|$|E

Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
