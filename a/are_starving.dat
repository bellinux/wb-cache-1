5|$|During a {{fundraising}} {{event in}} Russellville, Arkansas, Brightspirit's Mercy {{was performed by}} various high school drama students. The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, Brightspirit's Mercy is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan <b>are</b> <b>starving,</b> three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on Wands and Worlds, a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old Warriors fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, {{who were killed in}} a tornado in February 2007. They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.|$|E

500|$|The Spartan fleet {{suffered}} {{losses in}} the flight and reached the shore with the Athenians in close pursuit. Alcibiades's troops, leading the Athenian pursuit, landed and attempted to pull the Spartan ships back out to sea. The Peloponnesians fought to prevent their ships from being towed away, and Pharnabazus's troops came up to support them. Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered Theramenes to join up with Athenian land forces nearby {{and bring them to}} reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach. The Spartans and Persians, overwhelmed by the arrival of multiple forces from several directions, were defeated and driven off, and the Athenians captured all the Spartan ships which were not destroyed. A letter dispatched to Sparta by Hippocrates, vice-admiral under Mindarus, was intercepted and taken to Athens; it ran as follows: [...] "The ships are lost. Mindarus is dead. The men <b>are</b> <b>starving.</b> We know not what to do". A short time later Sparta petitioned for peace, but their appeals were ultimately rejected by the Athenians.|$|E
500|$|The rioters in Littleton had in {{the interim}} stolen a wagon and horses from Henry Tansley and {{equipped}} it with fowling guns front and back. Most of the Littleton mob, armed with guns and pitch-forks, then began the march to Ely, arriving three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) {{north of the city}} between 5am and 6am on 23 May. The Reverend William Metcalfe met them, read the Riot Act, and asked what the mob required. On being told that they wanted [...] "the price of a stone of flour per day" [...] and that [...] "our children <b>are</b> <b>starving,</b> give us a living wage," [...] the Reverend agreed but stated {{that he would have to}} converse with the other magistrates. He asked everyone to return to Littleport, but they marched on. Metcalfe implored them to go to the market place and many did go there, where they were joined by Ely citizens. Recognising the needs of the rioters, the Ely magistrates, the Reverends William Metcalfe, Peploe Ward and Henry Law drafted a response, offering poor families two-shillings per head per week and ordering farmers to pay two-shillings (£) per day wages. On hearing the proclamation, the mob cheered. The magistrates then [...] "gave the men some beer, told them not to get drunk and tried to persuade them to go home". Some took the advice, whilst others continued the rampage, intimidating shopkeepers, millers and bankers and stealing from some. However, most of the rioters, marching with their wagons and guns, left the city for Littleport before the arrival of the military from Bury.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this resounding defeat, Mindarus' name was immortalized {{in one of the}} most famous {{examples}} of Laconic brevity: a dispatch from the Spartan survivors was intercepted by the Athenians.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this {{dramatic}} victory, the Athenians had full control of {{the waters of the}} Hellespont. The next day, they took Cyzicus, which surrendered without a fight. An intercepted letter from the Spartan troops stranded near Cyzicus reads “The ships are gone. Mindarus is dead. The men <b>are</b> <b>starving.</b> We know not what to do." [...] Demoralized by the devastation of their fleet, the Spartans sent an embassy to Athens seeking to make peace; the Athenians rejected it.|$|E

The two come home and reminisce about men they've dated. Agnes, who is {{listening}} to the conversation, admits that she's never had a date. Mame and Vera decide to give the uptight, frumpy Agnes a makeover and send her out to live, because [...] "Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers <b>are</b> <b>starving</b> to death." [...] Six months later, Agnes returns home, visibly pregnant. Agnes then describes what she did while living it up (Gooch's Song).|$|E

[...] Secombe, now in character as Neddie Seagoon, arrives [...] "driving an unlicensed Goon Show with CD plates on". [...] Gritpype's comment is [...] "Yes, it does look a bit seedy, doesn't it." [...] The two villains then attempt their usual swindle of Neddie, in this case convincing him that his legs must be lagged to keep them warm for the coming winter, the payment being his [...] "war gratuity" [...] of one hundred pounds.|$|E

2500|$|Days {{after the}} end of World War I in November 1918, Hoover sailed to Europe. The United States Food Administration became the American Relief Administration (ARA), and Hoover was charged with {{providing}} food to Central and Eastern Europe. The ARA fed millions, including the inhabitants of Germany and the former Habsburg Empire. U.S. government funding for the ARA expired in the summer of 1919, and Hoover transformed the ARA into a private organization, raising millions of dollars from private donors. Under the auspices of the ARA, the European Children's Fund fed millions of starving children. In addition to nourishing millions, the ARA also helped the United States avoid a potentially problematic domestic food surplus. In response to criticism over his willingness to grant aid to countries under the sway of Bolshevism, Hoover stated, [...] "Twenty million people <b>are</b> <b>starving.</b> Whatever their politics, they shall be fed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Three years later, Cunegonde and the Old Lady {{discuss the}} miseries {{shared by the}} upper classes while the Governor doesn't want to hear their {{complaints}} ("Quiet"). Meanwhile, Candide and Cacambo <b>are</b> <b>starving</b> and lost in the jungles. Finding a boat in the ocean, they float downriver into a cavern for 24 hours until they finally reach Eldorado, the city of gold ("Introduction to Eldorado"). The two discover that the locals worship one god as opposed to three, palaces of science, rosewater and stones with cinnamon and clove scents. Dissatisfied without Cunegonde, Candide decides to leave. [...] The locals think him foolish, but offer to help, giving him some of the town's golden sheep and constructing a lift that will guide him, Cacambo and the sheep over the mountain ("The Ballad of Eldorado"). One by one, the sheep die until only two remain. Unwilling {{to go back to}} Montevideo, Candide gives Cacambo one of the golden sheep to ransom Cunegonde, telling them that they will meet again in Venice, Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{calls for}} the {{elimination}} of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which is tasked with coordinating preparedness and relief for natural disasters. He regards the argument for FEMA as “symptomatic of a blind belief in big government's ability to do anything and everything for anyone and everyone... When people <b>are</b> <b>starving,</b> injured and dying they need speed and efficiency, yet FEMA comes along with forms and policies and rubber stamps.” He complains that FEMA is a mismanaged and nearly-bankrupt bureaucracy, open to corruption. He also argues that the socialized insurance concept which underlies FEMA is deeply flawed, encouraging risk-taking – such as building beachfront homes in hurricane-prone coastal areas – that would be too expensive to consider if the sole source of disaster insurance were private-sector insurance purchased in the free market. In his view, disaster response management should be coordinated {{at the state and local}} level, without any federal involvement, and should be entirely voluntary and based on charitable goodwill. As Hurricane Irene bore down on the country's coast in August 2011, Paul said, “I live on the Gulf Coast. We put up with hurricanes all the time... In 1900, before FEMA, the local people rebuilt the city, built a seawall, and they survived without FEMA...” ...|$|E
