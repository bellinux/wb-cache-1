Fluid sloshing inside primary separators and non-segregated storage tanks may lead to oil/water mixing. The aim of previous work into sloshing has been to prevent damage to LNG tankers and increase the stability of space rockets. Work into oil/water sloshing appears limited. A computer controlled motion simulator was developed to conduct experiments with two rectangular vessels filled with <b>air,</b> <b>refined</b> oil and water. Two single sinusoidal forcing motions were applied, pitch and surge at various amplitudes and periods. Additional experiments were conducted with combined forcing motions pitch/roll and pitch/surge. Air/water interface profiles were measured and analysed using a computer based data logging and processing system. Air/oil and oil/water profiles were recorded using high speed video equipment. Also studied were the effect of baffles in reducing interface amplitude {{and the effect of}} forcing on oil/water transfer. A linear theory was derived to predict natural frequencies of three fluid systems and a numerical model was developed to predict near resonant behaviour. Air/water experiments and numerical model showed a coupling of natural and forcing frequencies in the free surface frequency spectrum. Favourable comparisons were also seen between the numerical model and oil/water experiments.

To identify the sources of particulate matter, examine {{the contributions of the}} sources to the air quality at specific areas and estimate the most likely locations of the sources, a growing number of source apportionment studies have been conducted. This paper provides an overview of the locations of the studies, salient features of the results obtained and offers some perspectives for the improvement of future receptor modelling of air quality in these countries. The review revealed that because of its advantages over alternative models, Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) was the most commonly applied model in the studies. Although there were differences in the sources identified in the studies, some general trends were observed. While biomass burning was a common problem in both countries, the characteristics of this source varied from one location to another. In New Zealand, domestic heating was the highest contributor to particle levels on days when the guidelines were exceeded. On the other hand, forest back-burning was a concern in Brisbane while marine aerosol was a major source in most studies. Secondary sulphate, traffic emissions, industrial emissions and re-suspended soil were also identified as important sources. Some unique species, for example, volatile organic compounds and particle size distribution were incorporated into some of the studies with results that have significant ramifications for the improvement of air quality. Overall, the application of source apportionment models provided useful information that can assist the design of epidemiological studies and <b>refine</b> <b>air</b> pollution reduction strategies in Australia and New Zealand...|$|R

K-rich birnessite structure is a two-layer orthorhombic polytype (2 O) with unit-cell parameters a = 5. 1554 (3) Ä, b = 2. 8460 (1) Ä, c = 14. 088 (1) Ä, α = β = γ = 90 °, a/b = √ 3. 281, and was refined in the Ccmm space group. The structure is characterized by the regular alternation of octahedral layers rotated with respect to each other by 180 °. Octahedral layers are essentially devoid of vacant sites, the presence of 0. 25 Mn 3 + layer cations within these layers being the main source of their deficit of charge, which is compensated for by interlayer K + cations. Mn 3 + octahedra, which are distorted by the Jahn-Teller effect, are systematically elongated along the a axis (cooperative Jahn-Teller effect) to minimize steric strains, thus yielding an orthogonal layer symmetry. In addition, Mn 3 + octahedra are segregated in Mn 3 +-rich rows parallel to the b axis that alternate with two Mn 4 + rows according to the sequence [...] . -Mn 3 +-Mn 4 +-Mn 4 +-Mn 3 +- [...] . along the a direction, thus leading to a A = 3 a super-periodicity. At 350 °C, the structure partially collapses due to the departure of interlayer H 2 O molecules and undergoes a reversible 2 O-to- 2 H phase transition. This transition results from the relaxation of the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect, that is from the random orientation of elongated Mn 3 + octahedra...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of silica fume when liquid metal is {{in contact with}} <b>air</b> during <b>refining</b> of metallurgical grade silicon leads to a direct loss of silicon. Apart from this yield loss the associated fume may be harmful to the workers in the plant. During tapping, refining and casting of silicon, the fume formation makes up 40 – 80 % of the fugitive emissions from the plant. In this work, the kinetics and mechanisms of fume formation during refining of metallurgical grade silicon were studied. Active oxidation {{is defined as the}} partial oxidation of Si to the gaseous product SiO. This type of oxidation does not protect the surface from further attack (passivation). When reviewing relevant literature, the majority of the research on active oxidation of silicon is done on solid silicon Research to date on liquid silicon oxidation on the other hand is primarily theoretical. As such, there is a knowledge gap concerning a mechanistic understanding of the active oxidation of liquid silicon. Boundary conditions, rate-controlling factors and flux dependencies on oxygen partial pressure and gas flow rate have not been systematically studied experimentally for active oxidation of liquid silicon. The amount of fume on an industrial scale and the characteristics of the fume such as elemental content, particle size and shape have not been adequately explored. In this project, the active oxidation of liquid silicon was investigated at three different scales; industrial measurements (~ 7 tonne Si); small-scale experiments 10 g Si); and medium-scale induction furnace experiments (1750 g Si). An experimental element distribution analysis of both main and trace-elements in the industrial refining ladle was performed. It was found that the amount of fume formed during industrial refining is in the range 0. 7 – 1. 8 kg of SiO 2 per tonne silicon produced. The main mechanism of SiO 2 -fume formation is oxidation of the surface, so that the exposed surface area is a main parameter controlling the fume formation in the industry. The boundary conditions for the oxidation of a still Si surface were determined from the small-scale experiments. The measurements confirmed an approximated theoretical mass transfer rate of oxygen and a maximum bulk oxygen pressure for active oxidation. From the induction furnace experiments {{it was found that the}} primary factor determining the rate of fume formation is the rate of transport of oxygen to the surface, which in turn is given by the velocity of the gas above the surface. This work is the first qualitative and quantitative study containing experimental investigations from small-scale to industrial scale on the kinetic and mechanistic nature of silicon oxidation. The industrial work has also contributes to a better understanding of distribution of elements in the silicon refining process, and it gives implications for emission estimation of toxic and other trace elements to the environment.

He worked ceaselessly for his parish, adding to the usual pastoral activities, youth meetings, open air public preaching and hymn writing - his own hymn book will soon be in use in his parish. His health is shaken by this intense work, and will remain a limitation for him. In 1855, he was counting with some satisfaction that the parish had gained 310 new members during his tenure, in other words one per Sunday…In 1855 he accepted the invitation of the Bond Street nonconformist chapel, in Leicester. His preaching and his action are successful there too. However he resigned after two years to open a new church in Leicester, on London Road. There he imposed his terms: the new parish should be open to people of the neighbourhood and inviting to newcomers, the old habits of pew-rent and fixed contributions should be replaced by voluntary gifts. His intention was to rid the church from widespread prejudices held by the working class. Additional endeavours included launching a mission in the nearby village of Reasby, establishing anti-alcoholic work. During his nine years as a pastor in London Road Chapel, the parish grew from 120 members to 450. In 1866 he moved to Grosvenor Street’s parish, in Picadilly, Manchester. In 1867 he intervened publicly to ask for mercy for 3 Fenians who had been condemned to death after their attack on a prisoners transfer vehicle which had left one policeman dead. Robert McAll organised a meeting with the participation of the victim's widow, where she expressed her forgiveness to the murderers of her husband. In spite of his efforts, he didn't succeed in obtaining the commutation of the death penalty of the Irish convicts.Between 1867 and 1871, he was pastor in Birmingham and in Hadleigh in Suffolk.The experience of Robert McAll in his various English parishes was a good preparation for his subsequent ministry in France: he was confronted with the material and moral misery of the working class, he tried various reach out methods including open <b>air</b> preaching, he <b>refined</b> his oratory talent and knew how to convince an audience with a fine mix of charm, humour and conviction.|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} biomass ash (BA) {{produced}} worldwide {{is expected to}} increase in the near future because biomass is commonly regarded as a carbon neutral fuel. Therefore, sustainable methods for the utilization of BA will be needed to manage the increased flux of BA from the energy sector while concurrently dealing with a smaller allowance of BA that can be landfilled. Therefore, research into new technologies is needed to find and exploit methods to utilize BA in safe and economically and environmentally sustainable ways in order to maximize the environmental benefits of biomass combustion. Presently BAs are utilized primarily in the construction of landfills or disposed of in landfills, with a minor percentage recycled for various purposes. Viable alternatives to landfill construction and landfill disposal require supportive evidence for their practicality, which is currently limited. One of the main barriers to reuse is the presence of heavy metals in BA. Therefore, finding effective methods for isolating and removing heavy metals is important to allowing reuse and is pursued in this work. Furthermore, this thesis seeks to assess the quality of specific BA samples as the quality pertains to their final usage, and to assess the sustainability of the usage solution to the comparable product that BA is replacing. Technologies were evaluated for their suitability and feasibility for utilizing BA as a replacement for traditional natural resources in specific applications. This thesis will seek to clarify the usage of <b>air</b> classification for <b>refining</b> BA for reuse as a product with the goal of contributing to the knowledge of viable and sustainable solutions for the reuse of BA. Background information on the quantities, quality, formation, analytical methods, utilization options, treatment methods and law and regulation related to BA were investigated prior to the experimental design. Based on that research and the interests of Ekokem, evaluation of three BA samples for reuse in agriculture, earth construction, cement and landfill disposal was completed. Additionally, air classification tests were performed on the BA samples with the objective of isolating certain components of the BA in a separate fraction; those samples were also evaluated for the same reuse schemes. The experiments produced three types of results. First was the procedure development in how to carry out air classification experiments and results directly related to air classification that can guide future research. Second were the results for individual samples and their reuse potential; one sample showed reuse possibilities without refining; the two other samples showed some improvements through air classification with isolation of heavy metals in the fine air classified fraction.

A wealth of scientific resources have been dedicated {{to the study of}} the sources of pollutant emissions to air in urban areas. Such studies may be quantitative, determining the contribution of each source of environmental pollution, or they may be qualitative, providing insight into the makeup of the emissions that afect a city's inhabitants. In Mediterranean countries, contamination may also be the result of natural phenomenon, such as the ow of dust from the arid regions of North Africa, and are therefore of primary importance as well. The ow of particulate matter transcends these geographic areas, passing over the Atlantic Ocean and reaching the American coasts. Among the fundamental tools available for measuring air pollution are the air-quality monitoring networks, made up of monitoring stations located both in urban areas and rural environments, with the aim of providing information on the air quality that afects us. In cities, some of these monitoring stations are located on sites that are outside of the direct range of emission sources and thus the determination of the urban background pollution, which is indicative of the generalised exposure of the population to air pollution, is possible. The objectives of this thesis were the following: To exhaustively characterise the air pollutants in urban and rural areas using the information obtained from the air-quality monitoring networks. To this end, a general methodology was developed to efciently manage the monitoring networks; To improve the existing methodology used to estimate the contribution of dust originating in the North African region that is carried by waves of warm air; To compare the air-pollution levels between the diferent urban-monitoring networks unafected by industrial pollution, and between diferent geographic locations, proposing a methodology that can be used to characterise environmental and background air pollution. In order to fulil the First objective, the primary and secondary air-pollution monitoring data were modelled using finite mixture models. Based on the calculation of the first and second moments of these mixtures, hierarchical cluster analysis, imputation using random forests, and principal component analysis were used. This methodological approximation enabled the detection of duplications within the parameters monitored by the monitoring stations, thus allowing these networks to be reconfigured and enabling the economic resources invested in them to be optimised. For the second objective, hidden Markov models (HMM) were introduced and the diferent regimes or PM 10 concentration profiles were described in some of the time series (TS) studied, enabling an estimation of the contribution of each of the profiles to environmental pollution. The new method proposed for estimating the natural contribution of PM 10 improves upon the reference methodology used in the European Union (monthly moving 40 th percentile method) in three ways - it avoids the use of empirical approximation, it applies modelling that is especially designed for the treatment of time-series data, and it allows for obtaining a con_dence interval for the contribution estimations for PM 10. For the third objective, hidden Markov models were also used, in this case to define and characterise the environmental and background pollution caused by primary air pollution in diferent urban areas of diferent cities. The attributable fraction for background air pollution was estimated using a new procedure based on the first concentration profile defined by the HMMs in the TS. The ratio and diference between environmental and background concentrations were also studied...|$|R
