5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, {{with athletes}} being judged on {{the distance that}} the object is thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|As <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> {{of war and}} hunting, javelin {{throwing}} {{began in}} prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, the Half Flight was {{augmented}} by four Martinsyde S1s and redesignated No.30 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps (RFC). The squadron moved into Kut following the city's capture by the Allies during the Battle of Es Sinn in September; {{for his part}} in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, however, both Treloar and White were captured and became prisoners of war, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the Battle of Ctesiphon in November, he devised <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> shaped like a small garden rake that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air in order to better map the desert terrain. During the Siege of Kut between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a millstone for grinding), medical supplies and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, the WD-45 was introduced, {{replacing}} the WD. The motor was increased to 226 cubic inches, giving it 30 horsepower on the drawbar at the Nebraska Tests. This was {{almost double the}} horsepower of the WD. A new Allis chalmers designed Snap- Coupler hitch was used. It allowed the operator to hook up to <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> from {{the seat of the}} tractor. A Buda diesel-powered WD-45 was introduced in 1955. This series stayed in production until the unveiling of the D-series in 1957.|$|E
25|$|A feather duster is <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> {{used for}} cleaning. It {{consists}} typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, {{the original idea}} for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County, Iowa. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking {{if they could be}} used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife, the duster was found to be too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> of {{the airport}} {{development}} as a hub Program was started {{with the support of}} Russian Federation Ministry of Transport, Sverdlovsk Oblast Government and the Renova Group. Investment into the Koltsovo large scale reconstruction of 2003–2009 years estimated about 12,000,000,000 rubles: private investments totaled 8,000,000,000 rubles (to the air-terminal complex development and technical re-equipment of services), state investments totaled 4,000,000,000 rubles (to rebuild aerodrome pavement and control tower building). In 2005 a new international terminal for Yekaterinburg finished construction and was exploited for proper use. The same year Yekaterinburg established new borders of the city, resulting in Koltsovo village, where the airport was located, in becoming part of Yekaterinburg's municipal district. A new catering facility was also implemented in 2005, as well as the international terminal.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} running events are {{held on the}} track which fall into three broad {{distance}} categories: sprints, middle-distance, and long-distance track events. Relay races feature teams comprising four runners each, who must pass a baton to their teammate after a specified distance {{with the aim of}} being the first team to finish. Hurdling events and the steeplechase are a variation upon the flat running theme in that athletes must clear obstacles on the track during the race. The field events come in two types – jumping and throwing competitions. In throwing events, athletes are measured by how far they hurl <b>an</b> <b>implement,</b> with the common events being the shot put, discus, javelin, and hammer throw. There are four common jumping events: the long jump and triple jump are contests measuring the horizontal distance an athlete can jump, while the high jump and pole vault are decided on the height achieved. Combined events, which include the decathlon (typically competed by men) and heptathlon (typically competed by women), are competitions where athletes compete {{in a number of different}} track and field events, with each performance going toward a final points tally.|$|E
500|$|Frank B. Adams (December 19, 1847 – after January 1923), {{commonly}} known as Yank Adams, was a professional carom billiards player who specialized in finger billiards, in which a player directly manipulates the balls {{with his or her}} hands, instead of using <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> such as a cue stick, often by twisting the ball between one's thumb and middle finger. Adams, who was sometimes billed as the [...] "Digital Billiard Wonder", has been called the [...] "greatest of all digit billiards players", and the [...] "champion digital billiardist of the World."

500|$|Holt {{wanted to}} find {{manufacturing}} facilities closer to the vast agricultural markets of the midwest. Benjamin Holt's nephew, Pliny E. Holt, had been dispatched in March 1909 to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he began manufacturing operations. They shipped parts for ten Model 45 tractors, but only two were produced. Pliny met Murray Baker, <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> dealer, who knew of an available factory {{that had been used}} to manufacture farm implements and steam traction engines. Baker, who later became the first executive vice president of what became Caterpillar Tractor Company, wrote to Holt headquarters in Stockton and described the plant of the bankrupt Colean Manufacturing Co. of East Peoria, Illinois. Pliny inspected the Colean factory in late June 1909 and learned they had spent at least $450,000 on the relatively new building and machinery. Holt could acquire the assets for the $50,000 note held by a trust company. Pliny Holt {{wrote a letter to the}} Stockton management team on July 1, 1909, reporting, [...] "The plant is as complete and perfect in every detail as I have ever seen ... and one of the best arranged plants that I ever saw." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{pioneers of}} {{photography}} in the Philippines were Western photographers, mostly from Europe. [...] The practice of taking photographs {{and the opening}} of the first photo studios in Spanish Philippines, from the 1840s to the 1890s, were driven by the following reasons: photographs were used as a medium of news and information about the colony, as a tool for tourism, as an instrument for anthropology, as a means for asserting social status, as <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> for historical documentation, as a device for communication, as materials for propaganda, and as a source of ideas for illustrations and engravings. [...] The practice of photography in the Philippines was not without the influence and influx of Western-art concepts into the colonized archipelago.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known and most studied example of an avian tool user is the {{woodpecker}} finch (Camarhynchus pallidus) from the Galápagos Islands. If the bird uncovers prey in bark which is inaccessible, the bird then flies off to fetch a cactus spine which it may use {{in one of three}} different ways: as a goad to drive out an active insect (without necessarily touching it); as a spear with which to impale a slow-moving larva or similar animal; or as <b>an</b> <b>implement</b> with which to push, bring towards, nudge or otherwise manoeuvre an inactive insect from a crevice or hole. Tools that do not exactly fit the purpose are worked by the bird and adapted for the function, thus making the finch a [...] "tool maker" [...] as well as a [...] "tool user". Some individuals have been observed to use a different type of tool with novel functional features such as barbed twigs from blackberry bushes, a plant that is not native to the islands. The twigs were first modified by removing side twigs and leaves and then used such that the barbs helped drag prey out of tree crevices.|$|E
