5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, <b>and</b> <b>plastic.</b> However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E

5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants brought back from explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain {{an important part of}} horticulture today, <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E
5|$|Ohio {{exported}} around $1.3 {{billion worth}} of rubber <b>and</b> <b>plastics</b> shipments in 2006. Rubber <b>and</b> <b>plastics</b> exports make up for 7.3% of total sales.

Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where {{the production of}} Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore.

5|$|After a year's {{training}} at Gwelo under the Empire Air Training Scheme, Smith passed {{out with the}} rank of pilot officer in September 1942. He hoped to be stationed in Britain, but was posted to the Middle East instead; there he joined No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in Cairo rebuilt Smith's face through skin grafts <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> surgery, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in Corsica in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{applied for}} and {{received}} UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and {{after several months}} of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis {{to move to the}} U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there he flew to Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church, both worked together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> knobs for the gearshift of cars. He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group based in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids.

The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E

Gaga accessorized the dress {{with a pair of}} feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> sleeves with it.

5|$|However, despite {{increased}} production, employment {{has been}} decreasing in Ohio's rubber <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> industry. In 2000, Ohio employed around 92,000 rubber and plastics industry workers. By 2006, those rates have declined by about 26% to about 69,000 workers. The Ohio Bureau of Labor Market Information predicts that, from 2004 to 2014, {{there will be}} 11,200 less workers in Ohio's industry. They also predict that plastics employment in Ohio will decrease by 13.7%, and that rubber products employment will decrease by 20.7%. The industry currently employs about 73,000 Ohio workers, and employs about 12.3% of the United States' rubber employees, and 7.8% of the United States' plastics employees.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, and high blood pressure.|$|E
