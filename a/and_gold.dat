5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, <b>and</b> <b>gold.</b> The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver <b>and</b> <b>gold,</b> both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. Senior classes would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms {{have been based on}} some combination of the four colors of the Maryland flag: red, white, black, <b>and</b> <b>gold.</b> The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black <b>and</b> <b>gold)</b> quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E

5|$|The university's {{colors are}} garnet <b>and</b> <b>gold.</b> The colors of garnet <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> {{represent}} a merging of the university's past. While the school fielded {{a football team}} as early, or earlier than 1899, in 1902, 1903 and 1905 the team won football championships wearing purple <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> uniforms. The following year, the college student body selected crimson as the official school color. The administration in 1905 took crimson and combined it with the recognizable purple of the championship football teams to achieve the color garnet. After World War II the garnet <b>and</b> <b>gold</b> colors were first worn by a renewed football team in a 14–6 loss to Stetson University on October 18, 1947. Florida State University's marching band is the Marching Chiefs.|$|E
