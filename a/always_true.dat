Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any {{children}} could be reared as Jews. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not <b>always</b> <b>true,</b> especially in later life.|$|E

25|$|The {{rule that}} for some {{distributions}} {{the difference between the}} mean and the mode is three times that between the mean and the median is due to Pearson who discovered it while investigating his Type 3 distributions. It is often applied to slightly asymmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution but it is not <b>always</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} unimodal distributions {{the median}} often lies between {{the mean and}} the mode, about {{one third of the}} way going from mean to mode. In a formula, median ≈ (2 × mean + mode)/3. This rule, due to Karl Pearson, often applies to slightly non-symmetric distributions that resemble a normal distribution, but it is not <b>always</b> <b>true</b> and in general the three statistics can appear in any order.|$|E

2500|$|During meiosis, {{chromosomes}} assort randomly into gametes, {{such that}} the segregation of alleles of one gene is independent of alleles of another gene. [...] This is stated in Mendel's Second Law and {{is known as the}} law of independent assortment. The law of independent assortment <b>always</b> holds <b>true</b> for genes that are located on different chromosomes, but for genes that are on the same chromosome, it does not <b>always</b> hold <b>true.</b>|$|R
25|$|This would {{reconcile}} the contradiction between our {{belief in the}} certainty of abstract deductions and the empiricist principle that knowledge comes from observation of individual instances. We know that Euler's equation is true because every time a human mind derives the equation, it gets the same result, unless it has made a mistake, which can be acknowledged and corrected. We observe this phenomenon, and we extrapolate to the general proposition that it is <b>always</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{frame is}} a tight frame if A = B; in other words, the frame {{satisfies}} a generalized version of Parseval's identity. For example, {{the union of}} k orthonormal bases of a vector space is a tight frame with A = B = k. A tight frame is a Parseval frame (sometimes called a normalized frame) if A = B = 1. Each orthonormal basis is a Parseval frame, but the converse is not <b>always</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
25|$|Not every semigroup {{homomorphism}} is a monoid homomorphism, {{since it}} may not map the identity to {{the identity of the}} target monoid, even though the element it maps the identity to will be an identity of the image of the mapping. In contrast, a semigroup homomorphism between groups is always a group homomorphism, as it necessarily preserves the identity. Since for monoids this isn't <b>always</b> <b>true,</b> it is necessary to state this as a separate requirement.|$|E

25|$|One concern {{related to}} the use of calendar-based methods is their {{relatively}} high failure rate, compared to other methods of birth control. Even when used perfectly, calendar-based methods, especially the rhythm method, result in a high pregnancy rate among couples intending to avoid pregnancy. Of commonly known methods of birth control, only the cervical cap and contraceptive sponge have comparably high failure rates. This lower level of reliability of calendar-based methods is because their formulas make several assumptions that are not <b>always</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{momentum}} form {{is preferable}} {{since this is}} readily generalized to more complex systems, generalizes to special and general relativity (see four-momentum). It {{can also be used}} with the momentum conservation. However, Newton's laws are not more fundamental than momentum conservation, because Newton's laws are merely consistent with the fact that zero resultant force acting on an object implies constant momentum, while a resultant force implies the momentum is not constant. Momentum conservation is <b>always</b> <b>true</b> for an isolated system not subject to resultant forces.|$|E

In 1959, and at four-year intervals back to 1927, Iranian New Year's Day fell on 22 March in the Gregorian calendar. In 1996, and subsequent Gregorian leap years, Iranian New Year's Day falls on 20 March. The pattern will shift back to a matching set of leap years in AD 2096.|$|E

25|$|In Irish law, {{women were}} {{forbidden}} to act as witnesses in courts. In Welsh law, women's testimony can be accepted towards other women but not against another man. In France, women's testimony must corroborate with other accounts or would not be accepted. Although women were expected to not attend courts, this however was not <b>always</b> <b>true.</b> Sometimes regardless of expectation, women did participate and attend court cases and court meetings. But women could not act as justices in courts, be attorneys, {{they could not be}} members of a jury and they could not accuse another person of a felony unless it's the murder of her husband. For most part, the best thing a woman could do in medieval courts is observe the legal proceedings taking place.|$|E
25|$|This, of course, is not <b>always</b> <b>true.</b> Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they}} are not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The hearsay rule controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} of the landscape in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as landscape ecology. Landscape ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize {{that this is not}} <b>always</b> <b>true.</b> These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing landscape. Landscape ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the landscape as perpetually changing. Landscape ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances {{as an integral part of}} the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for landscape to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.|$|E
