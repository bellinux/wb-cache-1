5|$|Mineirão (officially Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto) {{opened in}} 1965, and {{quickly became the}} home of both Atlético and Cruzeiro, as its peak {{capacity}} of over 100,000 spectators surpassed any other stadium in Belo Horizonte or in the state. The property {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Mineirão was Atlético's home from its opening until it closed in 2010 for renovations prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Historically the club's home ground, Atlético's most important matches have all been played at the Mineirão, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> has continued even after Independência became the first-choice home stadium again.

5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} battle {{that took place}} between Japan and Germany was the siege of the German-controlled Chinese port of Tsingtao in Kiautschou Bay. The German forces held out from August until November 1914, under a total Japanese/British blockade, {{sustained}} artillery barrages and manpower odds of 6:1 – <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> gave a morale boost during the siege as well as later in defeat. After Japanese troops stormed the city, the German dead were buried at Tsingtao and the remaining troops were transported to Japan where they were treated with respect at places like the Bandō Prisoner of War camp. In 1919, when the German Empire formally signed the Treaty of Versailles, all prisoners of war were set free and returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying gratification. In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay gratification and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed gratification) generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} artists {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> greatly contributed {{to the spread of}} the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.|$|E
5|$|Alejandro Gonzalez Malavé, the {{undercover}} agent who was accompanying the activists, was not indicted {{for his part}} in the slayings because he was granted immunity for testifying against other officers, but was removed from the police force due to public pressure. In February 1986, he was acquitted of kidnapping the taxi driver. His lawyer had argued that he was acting under orders and, therefore, it was the government who was actually guilty of kidnapping. This, despite the testimony presented by officer Carmelo Cruz who had testified that it was Gonzalez who recklessly endangered the hostage's life. The prosecution had provided evidence that he threatened the hostage at gunpoint, drove the car, and, when the car approached the mountaintop, refused to free the hostage despite suggestions from the activists. These actions, according to officer Cruz, were contrary to standard police procedures since his primary concern should have been the safety of the hostage. Nevertheless, the Puerto Rico Police Department did not reinstate Gonzalez as an active police officer, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he publicly expressed resentment over, and subsequently threatened to provide incriminating evidence to the media about other individuals involved in the shootings unless reinstated.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E
