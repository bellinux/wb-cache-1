5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but it took her two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Besides Chris Candido {{suffering}} a leg injury during his tag team match, Abyss also suffered a dislocated shoulder during {{the main event}} against A.J. Styles. Abyss' injury was taken care of backstage after the event, but Candido {{was diagnosed with a}} dislocated ankle, broken tibia, and a broken fibula that required surgery. Candido had an operation on April 25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle to fix the problem. Candido was reported to be sidelined for 2 to 3 months. According to reports, Candido suffered the injury from taking a dropkick by Sonny Siaki and landing on his leg improperly. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> he hoped to be recovered in 6 to 8 weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed where he died a short time later. Cause of death was released by his brother Johnny afterwards as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior. TNA released a public statement on April29 regarding the subject. TNA paid tribute to Candido on the April29 episode of Impact! as well as at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event. The April29 episode of Impact! opened and ended with a memorial to Candido. At Hard Justice, a ten-bell salute was held while a photo of Candido, a pair of boots, and one-half of the NWA World Tag Team Championship positioned on a steel chair sat in the center of the ring. In TNA's 50 Greatest Moments DVD, Candido's aiding The Naturals to win the NWA World Tag Team Championship was listed as number 10. A portion of the Lockdown DVD sale profits were donated by TNA to the Chris Candido Memorial Fund. TNA originally planned to remove Candido's match from the DVD, but were given the blessing of his family to include it on the publication. A tribute to Candido was included on the DVD by TNA.|$|E

5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the feeling that they know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery,</b> and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E

25|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} and vaginal prolapse {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress incontinence following hysterectomy.|$|E

25|$|At some point, most {{commonly}} 7–11 days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery</b> (but occasionally {{as long as}} two weeks (14 days) after), bleeding can occur when scabs begin sloughing off from the surgical sites. The overall risk of bleeding is approximately 1–2%. It is higher in adults, especially males over age 70 and three quarters of bleeding incidents occur {{on the same day}} as the surgery. Approximately 3% of adult patients develop significant bleeding at this time which may sometimes require surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Living {{donors are}} faced with risks and/or {{complications}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> Blood clots and biliary problems have the possibility of arising in the donor post-op, but these issues are remedied fairly easily. Although death is a risk that a living donor {{must be willing to}} accept prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor's immune system does diminish {{as a result of the}} liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.|$|E
25|$|A few {{patients}} {{who have had a}} hip replacement suffer chronic pain <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>surgery.</b> Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made {{in the front of the}} hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).|$|E

We sought to determine the predictive factors of recurrent PVR formation and the need for additional vitreoretinal surgical intervention after uncomplicated primary RD repair. Methods: This is a retrospective single-center case–control study of consecutive patients with PVR formation after uncomplicated RD repair. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with recurrent PVR formation. Results: Thirty-seven eyes (37 patients) who had recurrent RD secondary to PVR formation were included. Among those, 27 eyes needed one additional <b>surgery,</b> whereas <b>the</b> remainder 10 eyes required two or more additional <b>surgeries.</b> In <b>the</b> univariate analysis, patients who had cystoid macular edema (CME) <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery</b> were 8. 33 times (crude odds ratio [COR], 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 23 – 56. 67, p= 0. 0302) more likely to have recurrent PVR formation compared to those who did not have CME <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery.</b> Similarly, those who had epiretinal membrane (ERM) <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery</b> were 8. 00 times (COR, 95 % CI: 1. 43 – 44. 92, p= 0. 0182) more likely to have recurrent PVR formation compared to those who did not have ERM <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery.</b> In <b>the</b> multivariate analysis, patients who had ERM <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery</b> were 8. 20 times (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 95 % CI: 1. 08 – 62. 40, p= 0. 0422) more likely to develop recurrent PVR compared to those who did not have ERM <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery,</b> when adjusted for age, sex, and CME <b>after</b> <b>the</b> second <b>surgery.</b> Conclusion: ERM and CME are potential predictive factors for recurrent PVR formation after uncomplicated primary RD repair. Early recognition and treatment of ERM and CME may be critical to prevent subsequent PVR formation and improve visual outcomes.
