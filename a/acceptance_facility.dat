40|$|The siting of {{cumbersome}} infrastructur facilities frequently encounters protests {{by local}} population. While {{the causes of}} these 'acceptance problems' have been widely investigated in connection with facility construction, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge about the <b>acceptance</b> of <b>facilities</b> which already exist. How an infrastructure facility is evaluated by its neighbours once constructed is however crucial for designing measures to ensure that such facilities are acceptable in the long run. This study therefore investigates the perception and evaluation of cumbersome infrastructure facilities following their construction. In this study landfill sites will be taken as an example of necessary infrastructure facilities which nevertheless produce conflict in the planning phase. Two analytic perspectives will be applied to these facilities. The first treats landfill sites as objects with spatial effects: they alter the surrounding area adversely for the neighbouring residents, and are themselves spatial elements associated with nuisance and risks. The second perspective treats landfill sites as the result of a formal legal planning process, and conceptualises them correspondingly as socio-political objects. The empirical investigation is based on a survey of residents in the area around five selected landfill sites. The locations chosen vary in terms of the characteristics of the surrounding area, as well as in how long the site has operated. At the centre of the survey are the nuisances and impacts perceived by the neighbours, and the individual attitude to the facility. The residents were also asked to judge the planning process, the way the site is managed and possible improvement measures. The investigation reveals three main results. First, for landfill sites that are already operating, there is - contrast to the conficts which frequently exist in the planning phase - a large degree of acceptance by the neighbours. Secondly, although there is a close relationship between the perception of nuisance and acceptance of the landfill site, these are influenced by different factors. Thirdly, at each location the specific experiences with the landfill site as well as local conditions play an important role; no site-independent model can be found for neighbours' risk perceptions and <b>facility</b> <b>acceptance.</b> (orig.)

Department of Defense (DOD) that were charged with reviewing the status and availability of facilities to test components and subsystems for megawatt-class nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) systems. The facilities required to support development of NEP are available in NASA centers, DOE laboratories, and industry. However, several key facilities require significant and near-term modification in order to perform the testing required to meet a 2014 launch date. For the higher powered Mars cargo and piloted missions, the priority established for facility preparation is: (1) a thruster developmental testing facility, (2) a thruster lifetime testing facility, (3) a dynamic energy conversion development and demonstration facility, and (4) an advanced reactor testing facility (if required to demonstrate an advanced multiwatt power system). Facilities to support development of the power conditioning and heat rejection subsystems are available in industry, federal laboratories, and universities. In addition to the development facilities, a new preflight qualifications and <b>acceptance</b> testing <b>facility</b> will be required to support the deployment of NEP systems for precursor, cargo, or piloted Mars missions.

40|$|There {{is general}} <b>acceptance</b> by <b>Facilities</b> Management {{practitioners}} that failure to obtain feed {{back on the}} building performance can expose the facilities to serious consequences. Evaluating building performance is becoming a necessity in effectively observing the overall perspectives of facilities. However, not every FM organisation performs this exercise on a regular basis. There are many obstacles that prevent the evaluation being conducted effectively such as lack of funds, lack of expertise and awareness {{of the importance of}} building maintenance. The implementation of various performance levels in planned maintenance requires not only the standardisation of the condition assessment method, but also the related planning methodology. There are different facilities performance evaluation approaches in practice such as post-occupancy evaluation, usability, users journey, post-occupancy review of building engineering (PROBE) and building performance evaluation to mention but a few. These have their strengths and weaknesses. Through a critical review of extant literature, the paper examines these, and how they all contribute towards keeping the performance of facilities to an acceptable standard. The paper also considers the levels of need for particular evaluation methods from the facilities managers and owners perspectives. The paper concludes that an understanding of {{the pros and cons of}} the various evaluation methods is useful and allows effective decision to be arrived at in terms of appropriateness and suitability of an evaluation method...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to enable large reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, but one of the unanswered questions about CCS is whether it will be accepted by the public. In the past, construction of large facilities such as nuclear power plants has been prevented or delayed by public opposition, and CCS proponents would like to know whether it will provoke similar public opposition. Since the Geologic Storage (GS) component of the CCS architecture has not been widely deployed, this thesis explores the characteristics of GS and how they might affect public perception and acceptance of the larger CCS architecture. To provide insight regarding public acceptance of CCS, this thesis addresses two questions; first asking how GS is likely to be perceived by the public {{and what can be done}} to improve that perception, and second asking whether financial compensation can be used to improve public <b>acceptance</b> of energy <b>facilities.</b> To address the first question about the public perception of GS, this thesis begins with a discussion of risk concepts and how it is used differently by experts, who use a realist perspective, and the general public, who use a social constructivist perspective. (cont.) After discussing how this difference in perspective leads to risk disputes, this thesis presents an overview of the risk elements of GS. It then reviews existing risk assessments of GS and qualitatively evaluates the risks of GS in terms of their likelihood, impact, and uncertainty. The discussion on risk assessment perspectives and methods is then integrated with the GS risk review to forecast whether GS is likely to be accepted by the public. By using a public perspective to compare GS to existing energy technologies, this thesis concludes that the risks of GS are likely to eventually be considered no worse than existing fossil fuel energy technologies. However, since GS is a new technology with little public awareness, additional demonstrations and field tests will be necessary to make this case to the public. To address the question of whether financial compensation can be used to improve public <b>acceptance</b> of energy <b>facilities,</b> this thesis presents analyses of data from a public opinion poll on compensation and facility siting. Survey respondents were asked whether they would accept the construction of a natural gas pipeline, nuclear power plant, or coal fired power plant near their home if they were given annual payments of $ 100. (cont.) The compensation offers had little net effect on the public's willingness to accept the facilities, and the survey results do not support the use of compensation to improve public <b>acceptance</b> of energy <b>facilities.</b> By investigating public risk perception and GS risk assessments, this thesis concludes that 1) full-scale demonstrations of GS will be needed to convince the public that the technology is safe and 2) that financial compensation is ineffective for improving public opinion. by Gregory R.

MethodsBetween 2008 and 2012, 75 TBAs received 3 days of training and were paid US $ 5 for each patient brought to any of five healthcare facilities in Maroodi Jeex, Somaliland. Health facilities were upgraded (infrastructure, drugs and equipment, staff training, and incentivization). Eight key informant interviews (KIIs) and 10 focus group discussions (FGDs) involving 32 TBAs and 32 mothers were conducted. A framework approach was used for analysis. ResultsTBAs adopted their new role easily; instead of conducting home births and referring women to a facility only at onset of complications, they accompanied or referred mothers to a nearby facility for delivery, prenatal care, or postnatal care. Both TBAs and mothers accepted this new role, resulting in increased deliveries at health facilities. Facilitating factors included the creation of an enabling environment at the health <b>facility,</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the TBA by health facility staff, and monetary incentivization.
