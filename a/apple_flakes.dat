40|$|The {{fermentability}} of indigestible {{carbohydrates and}} content of short-chain fatty acids along the hindgut of rats were investigated using plant materials of importance in the Swedish diet (instant potato powder, <b>apples</b> and oat <b>flakes).</b> Results with the composite food products were compared with commercial fibre fractions obtained from similar sources, ie potato fibre, apple pectin and beta-glucan-enriched oat fibre. The materials were incorporated into diets yielding a concentration of 60 or 70 g kg (1) indigestible carbohydrates. The fermentability of indigestible carbohydrates was high with all diets, between 79 and 90 %. All substrates except the pure apple pectin generated intermediate to high proportions of butyric acid in the caecum (15 - 22 vs 8 %). The potato products gave high concentrations of butyric acid in the distal colon. The potato powder, ie the diet with the highest content of resistant starch (22 g kg(- 1)), also gave the highest proportion of butyric acid in the distal colon (19 %), which was higher than the proportion in the caecum with the same substrate (15 %) (P < 0. 005). The composite foods promoted {{a higher proportion of}} butyric acid in the distal colon as compared with the commercial fibre fractions (P < 0. 05). (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
