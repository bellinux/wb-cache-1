40|$|Introduction: Recently an Illumina Infinium 8 K apple SNP-chip was {{developed}} by the International RosBREED SNP Consortium for high-throughput genotyping and association studies (Chagne et al, 2012). We have used this SNP-chip to genotype 144 individuals of a Malus x domestica germplasm collection consisting of old Belgian and commercial cultivars, as well as 128 individual progeny of a mapping population. Aims: The genotype data generated was used i) to evaluate the overall performance of the chip and the robustness of the SNP calling both within a group of related individuals, as well as across a wider germplasm and ii) to develop a set of filter parameters to allow accurate <b>automatic</b> <b>calling</b> of the correct SNP genotype.

40|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{have recently}} replaced microsatellites as the genetic markers {{of choice in}} linkage analysis, primarily {{because they are more}} abundant and the genotypes more amenable for <b>automatic</b> <b>calling.</b> One of the most recently launched linkage mapping sets (LMS) is the Applied Biosystems Human LMS 4 K, which is a genome-wide link-age set based on the SNPlex technology and the use of clustered SNPs. In this article the authors report on their experience with this set and the associated genotyping software GeneMapper version 4. 0, which they have used for linkage analyses in 17 moderate to large families with assumed monogenic disease. For comparison of methods, they also performed a genome-wide linkage analysis in 1 of the 17 families using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10 K 2. 0 array. The conclu-sion is that both methods performed technically well, with high call rates and comparable and low rates of Mendelian inconsistencies. However, genotyping is less automated in GeneMapper version 4. 0 than in theAffymetrix software and thus more time consuming. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening 2009 : 92 - 96...|$|E
40|$|In {{the book}} the {{mathematical}} methods of nuclear cross sections and phases of elastic scattering, energy and characteristics of bound states in two- and three-particle nuclear systems, when the potentials of interaction contain not only central, but also tensor component, are presented. Are given the descriptions of the mathematical numerical calculation methods and computer programs in the algorithmic language "BASIC" for "Turbo Basic" of firm "Borland" for the computers of the type IBM PC AT. For the numerical solutions of the initial Schroedinger equations are used finite- difference and variational methods, and also method of Runge-Kutta with the <b>automatic</b> <b>calling</b> sequence on the assigned accuracy of results for the scattering phase shifts and binding energy. Is given the description not of the standard methods of solving the system of equations of Schroedinger to the bound states and the alternative to Schmidt's method, method of solution of the generalized matrix problem at the eigenvalues. The developed programs {{make it possible to}} determine the wave functions of relative motion of nuclear fragments, calibrated to the correct asymptotic behavior taking into account Coulomb interaction. The programs of the extraction of nuclear phases (phase shift analysis) from the differential elastic cross sections are given. The book can be used as the textbook according to the numerical mathematical methods for the students and the graduate students of the physical and mathematical specialties of higher educational institutions. This Book is written in Russian, but will perhaps present certain interest. Comment: 311...|$|E

50|$|An <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> {{distributor}} (ACD) is {{a communication}} system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers.
