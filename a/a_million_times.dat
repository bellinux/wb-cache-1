5|$|P.T. was {{originally}} announced at Gamescom 2014 as a demo for an eponymous mystery horror video game. It {{was released on}} 12 August 2014, on the PlayStation Network. Instead of formally announcing a new Silent Hill game, director Hideo Kojima decided to release P.T. as a game demo from a nonexistent gaming studio called 7780s Studio. In September 2014, Sony announced during its pre-Tokyo Game Show press conference that P.T. had been downloaded over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with humans, who are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E

It debuted on television channel VH1 on January 23 of the following year, reaching the Top 20 Countdown for two weeks in March. It was subsequently put on heavy rotation in April 2006, when it was played more than 50 times a week, reduced to 30 weekly airings in May. The video was the eighth most-watched music video on the Internet, with over 9.8 million views in 2006. Warner Bros. Records released the video on YouTube on October 26, 2009.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. The humans notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew – impossibly spindly creatures, who communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send messages to the humans. As her attempts to transmit from the civilization's territory are ineffective, she travels to a mountain range to transmit directly under the spacecraft – conquering the fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67billion g. The humans recognize her message and realize that the cheela live <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> faster than humans.|$|E
5|$|Theta Muscae is {{a triple}} star system {{thought to be}} around 7,500light-years distant. It {{consists}} of a spectroscopic binary system composed of the Wolf–Rayet star (spectral type: WC5 or 6) and an O-type main-sequence star (spectral type: O6 or O7) that orbit each other every 19 days and a blue supergiant (spectral type: O9.5/B0Iab) set about 46milliarcseconds apart from them. If the system's estimated distance from Earth is accurate, the binary stars are about 0.5astronomical units (AU) apart and the supergiant about 100AU apart from them. All three are highly luminous: combined, {{they are likely to}} be over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> as luminous as the Sun. TU Muscae is a binary star system located around 15,500light-years away made up of two hot luminous blue main sequence stars of spectral types O7.5V and O9.5V, with masses 23 and 15times that of the Sun. The stars are so close that they are in contact with each other (overcontact binary) and are classed as a Beta Lyrae variable as their light varies from Earth as they eclipse each other. The system ranges from apparent magnitude 8.17 to 8.75 over around 1.4days.|$|E

25|$|The European Space Agency's gamma-ray {{observatory}} INTEGRAL {{has observed}} gamma rays {{interacting with the}} nearby giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2, causing X-ray emission from the cloud. This energy was emitted about 350 years earlier by Sgr A*, possibly detectable from Earth around the year 1650. The total luminosity from this outburst (≈1,5 erg/s) {{is estimated to be}} <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> stronger than the current output from Sgr A* and is comparable with a typical active galactic nucleus. In 2011 this conclusion was supported by Japanese astronomers observing the Milky Way's center with the Suzaku satellite.|$|E
25|$|The {{first ever}} extra-solar auroras were {{discovered}} in July 2015 over the brown dwarf star LSR J1835+3259. The mainly red aurora {{was found to be}} <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material {{from the surface of the}} brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{beyond the}} Milky Way, {{there are at}} least 2 {{trillion}} other galaxies in the observable universe. The distances between galaxies are on the order of <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> further than those between the stars. Because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space, intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years, or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics, such as the Alcubierre drive. There are, however, no scientific reasons for stating that intergalactic travel is impossible in principle.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of scientists refute young Earth creationism.

YEC's theories are further contradicted by scientists' ability to observe galaxies billions of light years away.|$|E
25|$|Because {{methylmercury}} {{is formed}} in aquatic systems {{and because it}} is not readily eliminated from organisms it is biomagnified in aquatic food chains from bacteria, to plankton, through macroinvertebrates, to herbivorous fish and to piscivorous (fish-eating) fish. At each step in the food chain, the concentration of methylmercury in the organism increases. The concentration of methylmercury in the top level aquatic predators can reach a level <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> higher than the level in the water. This is because methylmercury has a half-life of about 72 days in aquatic organisms resulting in its bioaccumulation within these food chains. Organisms, including humans, fish-eating birds, and fish-eating mammals such as otters and whales that consume fish {{from the top of the}} aquatic food chain receive the methylmercury that has accumulated through this process. Fish and other aquatic species are the only significant source of human methylmercury exposure.|$|E
25|$|X-ray {{emission}} {{is expected}} from astronomical objects that contain extremely hot gases at temperatures from {{about a million}} kelvin (K) to {{hundreds of millions of}} kelvin (MK). Although X-rays have been observed emanating from the Sun since the 1940s, the discovery in 1962 of the first cosmic X-ray source was a surprise. This source is called Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1), the first X-ray source found in the constellation Scorpius. The X-ray emission of Scorpius X-1 is 10,000 times greater than its visual emission, whereas that of the Sun is about <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>times</b> less. In addition, the energy output in X-rays is 100,000 times greater than the total emission of the Sun in all wavelengths. Based on discoveries in this new field of X-ray astronomy, starting with Scorpius X-1, Riccardo Giacconi received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. It is now known that such X-ray sources as Sco X-1 are compact stars, such as neutron stars or black holes. Material falling into a black hole may emit X-rays, but the black hole itself does not. The energy source for the X-ray emission is gravity. Infalling gas and dust is heated by the strong gravitational fields of these and other celestial objects.|$|E
