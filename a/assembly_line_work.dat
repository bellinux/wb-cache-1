Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 20009 Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 57 - 58. This {{thesis is}} focused on <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> design problems in robotic cells. The mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> design problem that we study has several subproblems such as allocating operations to the stations in the robotic cell and satisfying the demand and cycle time within a desired interval for each model to be produced. We also ensure that assignability, precedence and tool life constraints are met. The existing studies in the literature overlook the limited lives of tools that are used for production in the <b>assembly</b> <b>lines.</b> Furthermore, the studies in the literature do not consider the unavailability periods of the <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> and assume that <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> <b>work</b> 24 hours a day continuously. In this study, we consider limited lives for the tools and hence we handle tool change decisions. In order to reflect a more realistic production environment, we deal with designing a mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> that <b>works</b> 24 {{hours a day in}} three 8 -hour shifts and we consider lunch and tea breaks that are present in each shift. This study is the first one to propose using such breaks as tool change periods and hence eliminate tool change related line stoppages. In this setting, we determine the number of stations, operation allocations and tool change decisions jointly. We provide a heuristic algorithm for our problem and test the performances of our heuristic algorithm and DICOPT and CPLEX solvers included in GAMS software on different instances with varying problem parameters.

The purpose of the Joint Committee (which {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Binkley committee") was to propose and promote solutions to problems in scholarly communication, including access to primary sources and publication of research results. Under Binkley's leadership the Joint Committee supported ever more innovative uses of new technologies for documentary reproduction, especially microfilm, with which he had been experimenting in his own darkroom with a Leica camera. What Watson Davis was to the promotion of microfilm in the sciences, Binkley was to the social sciences and humanities. He compiled two widely used manuals for the use of the new technologies, in 1931 and 1936. He hired Theodore R. Schellenberg as executive secretary of the Joint Committee and worked with him on the first large-scale microfilm publication project: the records of the hearings of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and National Recovery Administration in 1934, comprising 315,000 typescript pages. Binkley and Davis led a symposium on microfilm at the American Library Association conference in Richmond in 1935, which marked the emergence of microfilm into the mainstream of scholarship in the social sciences. The success of meetings such as this led to the establishment of the Journal of Documentary Reproduction, on whose editorial board Binkley served.

40|$|The mixed-model {{sequencing}} {{problem is}} to sequence different product models launched down an <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> so that <b>work</b> overload at the stations induced by direct succession of multiple labour-intensive models is avoided. As a concept of clearing overload situations, especially applied by Western automobile producers, a team of cross-trained utility workers stands by to support the regular workforce. Existing research assumes that regular and utility workers assemble side-by-side in an overload situation, so that the processing speed is doubled and the workpiece can be finished inside a station's boundaries. However, in many real-world <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> the application of utility workers is organised completely differently. Whenever it is foreseeable that a work overload will occur in a production cycle, a utility worker takes over to exclusively execute work, whereas the regular worker omits the respective cycle and starts processing the successive workpiece as soon as possible. This study investigates this more realistic sequencing problem and presents a binary linear program along with a complexity proof. Different exact and heuristic solution procedures are then introduced and tested. Additional experiments show that the new model is preferable from an economic point of view whenever utility work causes considerable setup activities, for example walking to the respective station.
