25|$|In India, amateur {{radio is}} governed by the Indian Wireless Telegraphs (<b>Amateur</b> <b>Service)</b> Rules, 1978, the Indian Wireless Telegraph Rules, the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000. The WPC is also {{responsible}} for coordinating with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Intelligence Bureau in running background checks before issuing amateur radio licences.|$|E
25|$|The amateur radio service (<b>amateur</b> <b>service</b> and amateur-satellite service) is {{established}} by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) through the Radio Regulations. National governments regulate technical and operational characteristics of transmissions and issue individual stations licenses with an identifying call sign. Prospective amateur operators are tested for their understanding of key concepts in electronics and the host government's radio regulations. Radio amateurs {{use a variety of}} voice, text, image, and data communications modes and have access to frequency allocations throughout the RF spectrum to enable communication across a city, region, country, continent, the world, or even into space.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1925 and 1941, the AARS {{continued}} to operate and functioned {{more or less}} as an extracurricular activity {{for members of the}} Army Signal Corps, with its scope limited by budget cuts during the Great Depression. [...] The AARS organization {{continued to}} operate until the United States entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, at which time radio amateurs were denied the use of the airwaves, and the <b>amateur</b> <b>service</b> and the Army Amateur Radio System were deactivated. [...] Following WWII, the US Army recognized the importance of reactivating the AARS to train vitally needed communications personnel at a relatively low direct cost to the government, and in 1946 the AARS was reactivated.|$|E
50|$|All of {{the above}} items are just some {{examples}} on the important role that RAC plays in protecting the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service</b> and ensuring that all Canadian Amateurs can enjoy their hobby.

5000|$|Under the International Telecommunication Union's rules, all amateur radio {{operations}} may only occur within 50 km of the Earth's surface. As such, the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service</b> is {{not permitted to}} engage in satellite operations; however, a sister radio <b>service,</b> called the <b>Amateur</b> Satellite <b>Service,</b> exists which allows satellite operations for the same purposes as the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service.</b> In most countries, an amateur radio license conveys operating privileges in both services, and in practice, the legal {{distinction between the two}} services is transparent to the average licensee. The primary reason the two services are separate is to limit the frequencies available for satellite operations. Due to the shared nature of the amateur radio allocations internationally, and the nature of satellites to roam worldwide, the ITU does not consider all amateur radio bands appropriate for satellite operations. Being separate from the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service,</b> the <b>Amateur</b> Satellite <b>Service</b> receives its own frequency allocations. All the allocations are within amateur radio bands, and with one exception, the allocations are the same in all three ITU regions. Some of the allocations are limited by the ITU in what direction transmissions may be sent (EG: [...] "Earth-to-space" [...] or up-links only).|$|R

[...] VEs are licensed radio amateurs who conduct examination sessions, frequently through permanently established teams on a monthly or quarterly basis. VEs are governed by Volunteer Examinator Coordinators (VECs), organizations that [...] "coordinate the efforts of Volunteer Examiners ... in preparing and administering <b>amateur</b> <b>service</b> operator license examinations." [...] Although the FCC currently recognizes 14 VECs, the two largest VEC organizations are the one sponsored by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) and the one started by W5YI, now sold and operated by another party.

50|$|In the United States, {{there are}} two major methods of {{organizing}} amateur radio emergency communications: the <b>Amateur</b> Radio Emergency <b>Service</b> (ARES), an organization of amateur operators sponsored by the American Radio Relay League (ARRL); and the Radio <b>Amateur</b> Civil Emergency <b>Service</b> (RACES), a standby replacement radio service regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Operations under the RACES rules requires preregistration with a local civil defense organization, to allow continued operation under Part 97.407 of the FCC regulations in the event the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service</b> is ever shut down by presidential order. Thus ARES and RACES involvement within the same area are usually intertwined, with many governments requiring membership and service in that locale's ARES organization to allow operations within the <b>Amateur</b> Radio <b>Service</b> as well. Many government Emergency Operations Centers, Red Cross Chapters and National Weather Service facilities have permanent Amateur Radio stations installed for such operations.|$|R
