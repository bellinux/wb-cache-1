Failure probabilities for each event were assigned to a class ranging from 1 to 6 corresponding to {{an order of magnitude}} failure probability from 0.1 - 0.8 to 0.00001 - 0.0001, respectively. For the specific system considered in the analysis presented in Hauptmann’s paper, failure probabilities of 7.1 ×[*] 10 - 4, 5.5 ×[*] 10 - 2, 6.4 ×[*] 10 - 5, and 3.1 ×[*] 10 - 3 were estimated for the sprinkler piping network, <b>alarm</b> <b>valve</b> station, water supply, and pumps, respectively.|$|E
50|$|By a wide margin, wet pipe {{sprinkler}} systems are installed {{more often than}} all other types of fire {{sprinkler systems}}. They also are the most reliable, because they are simple, with the only operating components being the automatic sprinklers and (commonly, but not always) the automatic <b>alarm</b> check <b>valve.</b> An automatic water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping.|$|R

It was later identified that the Castleberry's plant had serious production problems {{on a specific}} line of retorts that had under-processed the cans of food. These issues included broken cooking <b>alarms,</b> leaking water <b>valves</b> and inaccurate temperature devices, all the result of poor management of the company. All {{of the victims were}} hospitalized and placed on mechanical ventilation. The Castleberry's Food Company outbreak was the first instance of botulism in commercial canned foods in the United States in over 30 years.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} eight {{different versions of}} portable tools for sampling from sealed containers. These tools allow the user to rapidly drill into a closed container, extract a sample of its contents (gas, liquid, or free-flowing powder), and permanently reseal the point of entry. This is accomplished without exposing the user or the environment to the container contents, even while drilling. The tools are inexpensive, small, and easy to use. They work with any battery-powered hand drill. This allows considerable safety, flexibility, and maneuverability. The tools also permit the user to rapidly attach plumbing, a pressure relief <b>valve,</b> <b>alarms,</b> or other instrumentation to a container. There {{are a variety of}} possible applications for these tools, including for waste management...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} several {{different types of}} tools for sampling from sealed containers. These tools allow the user to rapidly drill into a closed container, extract a sample of its contents (gas, liquid, or free-flowing powder), and permanently reseal the point of entry. This is accomplished without exposing the user or the environment to the container contents, even while drilling. The entire process is completed in less than 15 seconds for a 55 gallon drum. Almost any kind of container can be sampled (regardless of the materials) with wall thicknesses up to 1. 3 cm and internal pressures up to 8 atm. Samples can be taken from the top, sides, or bottom of a container. The sampling tools are inexpensive, small, and easy to use. They work with any battery-powered hand drill. This allows considerable safety, speed, flexibility, and maneuverability. The tools also permit the user to rapidly attach plumbing, a pressure relief <b>valve,</b> <b>alarms,</b> or other instrumentation to a container. Possible applications include drum venting, liquid transfer, container flushing, waste characterization, monitoring, sampling for archival or quality control purposes, emergency sampling by rapid response teams, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and treaty verification, and use by law enforcement personnel during drug or environmental raids...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in June 2007, {{eight people}} {{contracted}} botulism {{due to the}} consumption of [...] "Hot Dog Chili Sauce" [...] and other products manufactured by the Castleberry's Food Company plant in Augusta, Georgia, which were under-processed, resulting {{in the production of}} botulinum toxin within the cans. At that time, the Castleberry's plant was owned and operated by Bumble Bee. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the food poisoning to Castleberry's Food Company's use of a defective canning process which was inadequate to destroy spores of clostridium botulinum bacteria, thereby enabling the bacteria to produce botulinum toxin as the products aged. An FDA investigation later revealed that the problem arose from the use of canners which [...] "had broken <b>alarms,</b> a leaky <b>valve</b> and an inaccurate temperature device." [...] The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised consumers to dispose of foods recalled due to the food poisoning incidents in the following manner:Do not open or puncture any unopened can of the recalled product ... Dispose of food that may be contaminated by placing in a sealable bag, wrapping another plastic bag around the sealable bag, and then taping tightly. Place bags in a trash receptacle for non-recyclable trash outside the home and out of reach of humans and pets. Do not discard the food in a sink, garbage disposal, or toilet. Avoid splashing and contact with the skin. Wear rubber or latex gloves when handling open containers of food that you think may be contaminated. Wash hands with soap and running water for at least 2 minutes after handling food or containers that may be contaminated.|$|R
