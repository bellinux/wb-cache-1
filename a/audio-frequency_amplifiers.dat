Moreover, taking into account the large number of students, the availability of the lab can be greatly extended. In order to give flexibility and high performances to the educational tool a user friendly virtual instrument has been realised allowing distance learning. Some basic experiments can be performed by the user, namely the analysis of both the RC and the RLC circuits, frequency measurements and also measurements on <b>audio-frequency</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Indeed, the user can make the choice of the experiment which he is interested in and can choose the particular procedure among the implemented ones. By using the adopted procedure the user can carry out a proper training without loosing the contact with real instruments. In order to emphasize the features of the implemented system some examples are presented. A “presence effect ” will be added in the next future, by using a web camera in the lab...|$|E
2500|$|Digital {{integrated}} circuits such as microprocessors and memory devices contain thousands {{to millions of}} integrated MOSFET transistors on each device, providing the basic switching functions required to implement logic gates and data storage. Discrete devices are widely used in applications such as switch mode power supplies, variable-frequency drives and other power electronics applications where each device may be switching {{hundreds or thousands of}} watts. Radio-frequency amplifiers up to the UHF spectrum use MOSFET transistors as analog signal and power amplifiers. Radio systems also use MOSFETs as [...] oscillators, or mixers to convert frequencies. MOSFET devices are also applied in <b>audio-frequency</b> power <b>amplifiers</b> for public address systems, sound reinforcement and home and automobile sound systems ...|$|R
