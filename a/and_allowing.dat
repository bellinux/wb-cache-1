5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry. More mud is added <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> to dry.|$|R

The Yankees {{would end up}} taking the series, 3–2.|$|E
50|$|This ability {{means the}} DFE {{approach}} is extremely flexible <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> the course designer to target {{specific aspects of}} the course design.

40|$|Version {{control system}} VCS {{keeps track of}} all work and all changes {{in a set of}} text files, {{typically}} the implementation of a software project, <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> several, widely separated, developers to collaborate. System makes work easier to developers when working on several files <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> them to keep track of all changes that have occurred.

5000|$|The DMX {{features}} 24 individual drum sounds {{derived from}} 11 original samples [...] <b>and</b> <b>allows</b> for a maximum 8-voice polyphony; one voice per card. It also featured eight separate outputs for individual processing, <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> up to 100 sequences and 50 songs. One of the distinguishing {{features of the}} DMX is that it allowed integration with Oberheim's proprietary interfacing system (the Oberheim Parallel Buss) that pre-dated MIDI <b>and</b> <b>allowed</b> Oberheim equipment to be synchronized with the machine. Later models included factory-fitted MIDI ports and third party companies also manufactured MIDI interfaces for the DMX.|$|R
5|$|The {{contracted}} {{batch of}} 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20. NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites, {{with plans to}} increase {{the mass of the}} CSM and LM for the last five missions, along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V. These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list, allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> them to stay on the Moon for over three days. These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) increasing the exploration area <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> televised liftoff of the LM. Also, the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.|$|E
5|$|The victory gave Britain {{dominance}} {{over its}} European rivals {{in the eastern}} Pacific and western Indian Ocean, allowing free passage of British trade through the region <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> British forces {{to focus on the}} one remaining threat to their merchant convoys in the Indian Ocean: the French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France (now Mauritius).|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> the gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly {{enough to avoid}} further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E

5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> the crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E

5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} early and mid-1911, respectively, Edgar Quinet and Waldeck-Rousseau {{were assigned to}} the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1913, Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration that also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania.

5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> the 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, {{along with}} the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the {{documents}} ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> it to rearm.

His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would not result in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant {{was able to give}} speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.|$|E
