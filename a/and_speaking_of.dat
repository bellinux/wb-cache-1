5|$|In December 2007, Winehouse's {{spokesman}} {{reported that}} the singer was in a physician-supervised programme and was channelling her difficulties by writing a lot of music. The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E
25|$|German Americans by {{this time}} usually had only weak ties to Germany; however, they were fearful of {{negative}} treatment they might receive if the United States entered the war (such mistreatment was already happening to German-descent citizens in Canada and Australia). Almost none called for intervening on Germany's side, instead calling for neutrality <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> the superiority of German culture. They were increasingly marginalized, however, and by 1917 had been excluded almost entirely from national discourse on the subject.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Jamaica on 14 December, Eden still hoped to {{continue}} as Prime Minister. He had lost his traditional base of support on the Tory left and amongst moderate opinion nationally, but appears to have hoped to rebuild a new base of support amongst the Tory Right. However, his political position had eroded during his absence. He wished {{to make a statement}} attacking Nasser as a puppet of the Soviets, attacking the United Nations <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> the “lessons of the 1930s”, but was prevented from doing so by Macmillan, Butler and Lord Salisbury.|$|E

Nannini finished in fourth, while Pierluigi Martini qualified fifth and finished in that position, also leading for one lap; the only time in the Minardi team's 21-year history that it led a Grand Prix. Tyrrell racing finished in sixth for the 2nd consecutive race, although it was Jonathan Palmer that earned the point for them in Portugal. The new Williamses, however, suffered near-simultaneous and identical motor blow-outs. Up until then they looked promising.|$|E
25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, first Mark, {{and then}} Matthew and Luke, depict Jesus as {{presiding over the}} Last Supper. References to Jesus' body and blood foreshadow his crucifixion, and he identifies them as a new covenant. In the gospel of John, {{the account of the}} Last Supper has no mention of Jesus taking bread and wine <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> them as his body and blood; instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other.|$|E

500|$|Hi-5 finds {{success as}} a leading children's theatre entity. The stage show Hi-5 Alive won a Helpmann award for Best Presentation for Children 2002. A {{successful}} sold out tour of the House Hits show in the Philippines in 2014 led to the group returning for an encore run of the tour in 2015. Reviewing the Circus Stageshow in 2008 <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> the group's circus skills, Nicole Bittar of The Age reported, [...] "the ever-ebullient television quintet have a promising alternative career if they ever tire of preschool-idol status".

500|$|In {{line with}} the McGregor's ideal of unified workers was a [...] "quest" [...] to make order from the chaos around him. Throughout Marching Men distinctions between order and {{disorder}} are put forward both as ruminations of the narrator and as elements of the plot. Examples of comparisons in the plot begin early on when miners in disarray are compared with organized soldiers. Later, an unbridled Chicago is contrasted with McGregor's orderly routine. Finally, the frustrated mass of job-seekers McGregor encounters upon his arrival to the city is seen against the neat groups of marching men that excite a young reporter in Book VI. Beyond plot points, phrases such as [...] "In the heart of all men lies sleeping the love of order..." [...] <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> McGregor, [...] "His body shook with {{the strength of his}} desire to end the vast disorder of life", among others [...] also work to set up the dichotomy of order and chaos.|$|E
500|$|After the Union in 1707 and {{the shift}} of {{political}} power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, considered themselves Northern British rather than Scottish. They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots {{in a bid to}} establish standard English as the official language of the newly formed Union. Many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about £ in today's money) they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a [...] of the City of Edinburgh.

500|$|After the Union in 1707 and {{the shift}} of {{political}} power to England, the use of Gaelic and Scots were discouraged by many in authority and education. The Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), established in 1709, aimed to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. It was partly cultural, intending to [...] "wear out" [...] Gaelic and [...] "learn the people the English tongue". Although SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture.

2500|$|Musician David Bowie {{described}} himself as Jungian in his relationship to dreams and the unconscious. [...] Australian artist Tanja Stark extensively explored Jungian aspects of his work in her essay [...] "Crashing Out with Sylvian: David Bowie, Carl Jung and the Unconscious". [...] Bowie sang of Jung on his album Aladdin Sane (a word play on sanity) and attended the exhibition of The Red Book in New York with artist Tony Oursler, who described Bowie as [...] "... reading <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> the psychoanalyst with passion". [...] Bowie's 1967 song [...] "Shadow Man" [...] poetically encapsulates a key Jungian concept, while in 1987 Bowie tellingly described the Glass Spiders of Never Let Me Down as Jungian mother figures around which he not only anchored a worldwide tour, but also created an enormous onstage effigy.|$|E
2500|$|After the Union in 1707 and {{the shift}} of {{political}} power to England, the use of Scots was discouraged by many in authority and education. Intellectuals of the Scottish Enlightenment like David Hume and Adam Smith, {{went to great lengths}} to get rid of every Scotticism from their writings. Following such examples, many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution.

2500|$|Tyndall {{believed}} the Nordic race {{to be superior}} to other races, and under his leadership, the BNP promoted a variety of pseudoscientific claims in support of white supremacy. Following Griffin's ascendency to power in the party, it officially repudiated racial supremacism and insisted that no racial group was superior or inferior to another. Instead it foregrounded an [...] "ethno-pluralist" [...] racial separatism, claiming that different racial groups had to be kept separate and distinct for their own preservation, maintaining that global ethno-cultural diversity was something to be protected. At {{the same time it}} switched focus from openly promoting biological racism to stressing what it perceived as the cultural incompatibility of racial groups. It placed great focus on opposing what it referred to as [...] "multiculturalism", characterising this as a form of [...] "cultural genocide", which promotes the interests of non-whites {{at the expense of the}} white British population. However, internal documents produced and circulated under Griffin's leadership demonstrated that it retained its dedication to biological racist ideas. In focusing on culture rather than biology <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> 'ethno-pluralism', Griffin's BNP borrowed much of its discourse from the French Nouvelle Droite.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the gospel}} of John, however, {{the account of the}} Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and [...] "the cup" [...] <b>and</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long {{discourse}} in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other. In , the evangelist attributes a long discourse to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread and in [...] contains echoes of Eucharistic language. The interpretation of the whole passage has been extensively debated due to theological and scholarly disagreements. Sir Edwyn Hoskyns notes three main schools of thought: (a) the language is metaphorical, and verse 63: [...] "The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you—they are full of the Spirit and life" [...] gives the author's precise meaning; (b) vv 51-58 are a later interpolation that cannot be harmonized with the context; (c) the discourse is homogeneous, sacrificial, and sacramental and can be harmonized, though not all attempts are satisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 February 2008, she {{was awarded}} the César Award for Best Actress for her {{performance}} in La Vie en Rose. Alain Delon presented the award and announced the winner as [...] "La Môme Marion" [...] (The Kid Marion), also praising her on stage saying: [...] "Marion, I give you this César. I think this César is for a great great actress, and I know what I'm talking about". Two days later, on 24 February 2008 at the Academy Awards, she won Best Actress, becoming the first woman and second person (after Adrien Brody, The Pianist) to win both a César and an Oscar for the same performance. Cotillard is the second French cinema actress to win this award and the third overall to receive an Academy Award after Simone Signoret in 1960 and Juliette Binoche in 1997. She is the first Best Actress winner in a non-English language performance since Sophia Loren's win in 1961. She is also the first and (as of 2017) only winner of an Academy Award for a performance in the French language. In her Oscar acceptance speech, Cotillard proclaimed [...] "thank you life, thank you love" [...] <b>and,</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> Los Angeles, said [...] "it is true, there is some angels (sic) in this city!"
