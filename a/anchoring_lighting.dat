50|$|Ships {{at anchor}} display {{one or two}} white <b>anchor</b> <b>lights</b> (depending on the vessel's length) {{that can be seen}} from all directions. If two lights are shown then the forward light is higher than the aft one.|$|R
60|$|When he was rowed {{across the}} harbour {{he heard a}} guitar badly played, and jumping down from Cayman's bulwarks saw Macallister sitting under the <b>anchor</b> <b>light.</b> The {{engineer}} held the guitar awkwardly, and the sailors sat round and laughed.|$|R
50|$|The saloon main helm {{position}} is located to port with hydraulic steering, single lever engine controls, full engine manufacturer's instrumentation and alarms, magnetic compass, switches for navigation <b>lights,</b> <b>anchor</b> <b>light,</b> deck light, windscreen wipers. Washers {{to all three}} screens fed from main water tanks. LED indicators for identification of connected circuits. Voltmeter with selector switch for engine and domestic battery monitoring. 2 battery isolation switches.|$|R
60|$|The dew {{was falling}} and the deck was damp. Moisture dripped from the masts and ropes, {{and it was}} very hot. The <b>anchor</b> <b>light</b> tossed against the portentous gloom of the land. The yacht looked old and dirty, though Marston knew her {{strength}} and speed; the half-naked crew made no noise as they stole about. Their dark skin was scarcely distinguishable and Marston thought they rather looked like ghosts than men.|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, {{they were}} fast {{coming up with}} the light, and when a high, dark wall ran out in front Wyndham luffed the boat and they lowered sail and took down the mast. Marston sculled her past the wall, and the narrow harbor opened up. A few <b>anchor</b> <b>lights</b> swung languidly inside, and the indistinct, dark shape of a steamer shut out part of the wall. When they got near her Marston stopped sculling.|$|R
2500|$|... when at <b>anchor,</b> the <b>lights</b> or shapes {{prescribed}} in {{this paragraph}} {{instead of the}} lights or shape prescribed in Rule 30.|$|R
5000|$|The Ladies Delight Light {{is a small}} {{lighthouse}} on Lake Cobbosseecontee, in Winthrop, Maine, United States. It {{was constructed}} in 1908 and {{is believed to be}} the only active inland waters lighthouse in Maine. The tower is 25 ft tall, and is equipped with a 100-watt light bulb further intensified by a lens from a ship's <b>anchor</b> <b>light.</b> At the time of its construction, it was the only inland lake lighthouse east of the Mississippi River. [...] It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.|$|R
60|$|The others {{went with}} him to the gangway and when the launch steamed off Marston sat down and looked about. It had got dark but a half moon drew a {{sparkling}} track across the calm sea. <b>Anchor</b> <b>lights</b> swung languidly by the shore, and in the background the white town shone with a pale reflection against the dusky hills. Music came off across the water with the rumble of the surf, and the smooth swell splashed softly against the vessel's side. Presently Marston turned and looked to the east.|$|R
60|$|Lingard ignored this {{wreck of}} an adventurer, {{sticking}} to him closer than his shadow, {{and the other}} {{did not try to}} attract attention. He waited patiently at the doors of offices, would vanish at tiffin time, would invariably turn up again in the evening and then he kept his place till Lingard went aboard for the night. The police peons on duty looked disdainfully at the phantom of Captain H. C. Jorgenson, Barque Wild Rose, wandering on the silent quay or standing still for hours {{at the edge of the}} sombre roadstead speckled by the <b>anchor</b> <b>lights</b> of ships--an adventurous soul longing to recross the waters of oblivion.|$|R
6000|$|And {{now that}} we've gone in for it, {{why not have}} a {{searchlight}}? It would be tremendously useful. But the searchlight needs so much electricity that when it runs it will put all the other lights out of commission. Again we travel the weary road in the quest after more power for storage battery and dynamo. And then, when it is finally solved, some one asks, [...] "What if the engine breaks down?" [...] And we collapse. There are the sidelights, the binnacle <b>light,</b> and the <b>anchor</b> <b>light.</b> Our very lives depend upon them. So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.|$|R
60|$|A <b>light</b> <b>anchor</b> {{attached}} to a hawser was silently let down into the water.|$|R
50|$|Kedging or warping is a {{technique}} for moving or turning a ship by using a relatively <b>light</b> <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{the offing}} the Karlsefin swayed at <b>anchor,</b> her <b>lights</b> seeming to {{penetrate}} the water to countless fathoms with their shimmering, lanceolate reflections. The Caribs were busy loading her {{by means of the}} great lighters heaped full from the piles of fruit ranged upon the shore.|$|R
60|$|The men {{pulled down}} the harbour. A smooth swell rolled in {{and two or three}} <b>anchor</b> <b>lights</b> tossed and swung. By and by engines throbbed in the dark, and Kit saw moving beams of red and green. The French gunboat had arrived the day before, and her launch was coming off from the mole. For a minute or two Kit was disturbed, but the launch steamed by and {{vanished}} in the dark. Kit steered for Mossamedes' lights and when he got on board went to the captain's room. Don Erminio, wearing his old English clothes, fronted Macallister in greasy dungarees, and between them some bottles and glasses balanced the swing-table. Kit put down the bills of lading and remarked that he had agreed the captain would sign the documents.|$|R
60|$|Presently he {{went out}} to look at the weather. The rain had stopped and low mist hung about, but a {{half-moon}} was rising in a patch of clear sky. The swell heaved, long and smooth, about the sloop, which swung up and down with a regular motion. Jimmy could see the yacht’s <b>anchor</b> <b>light</b> not far away and the yellow blink from her saloon windows, but he could hear nothing that suggested preparations for sending off a boat. As it was cold in the cockpit, he returned to the cabin, where the others had lighted the lamp, and none of them said much for the next hour. They could hear the loose halyards slap the mast and the water splash about beneath the floorings, and the soft lapping of the tide along the planking.|$|R
50|$|The museum {{collection}} includes giant 6 {{feet tall}} <b>anchors</b> and <b>lights</b> that are knee high and were once atop of a lighthouse. The museum also houses old maps {{and photographs of}} Mumbai, rich in diversity from goldsmiths and policemen to mill workers and fisher folk along with scale models of ships, trawlers and dhows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mud," [...] was French Pete's verdict. [...] "Just one vaire {{small patch}} of mud right there. If she get t'rough it she 's a sure-enough goner, I tell you dat. Her <b>anchors</b> vaire <b>light,</b> only good for mud. I tell ze boys get more heavy anchors, but dey laugh. Some day be sorry, for sure." ...|$|R
50|$|With recent {{progress}} in CNT development and fabrication, there is promise to use various CNT based nanocomposites and nanostructures {{to direct the}} flow of photogenerated electrons and assist in charge injection and extraction. To assist the electron transport to the collecting electrode surface in a DSSC, a popular concept is to utilize CNT networks as support to <b>anchor</b> <b>light</b> harvesting semiconductor particles. Research efforts along these lines include organizing CdS quantum dots on SWCNTs. Charge injection from excited CdS into SWCNTs was documented upon excitation of CdS nanoparticles. Other varieties of semiconductor particles including CdSe and CdTe can induce charge-transfer processes under visible light irradiation when attached to CNTs. Including porphyrin and C60 fullerene, organization of photoactive donor polymer and acceptor fullerene on electrode surfaces {{has also been shown}} to offer considerable improvement in the photoconversion efficiency of solar cells. Therefore, there is an opportunity to facilitate electron transport and increase the photoconversion efficiency of DSSCs utilizing the electron-accepting ability of semiconducting SWCNTs.|$|R
50|$|Other Equipment - Electric {{running and}} riding <b>lights,</b> <b>anchor</b> and warp, boat hook, flag staff, canvas bucket, mop, few tools, fenders, life ring, dock lines, compass and binnacle, life lines, pulpit dinghy chocks, hatch and {{skylight}} covers.|$|R
60|$|The Trois Freres was run {{on until}} within {{a hundred yards}} of the shore, then a <b>light</b> <b>anchor</b> was dropped. The two boats had already been lowered and were towed alongside, {{and the work of}} {{transferring}} the cargo at once began.|$|R
5000|$|Vessels {{may carry}} {{a number of}} anchors: bower anchors (formerly known as sheet anchors) are the main anchors used by a vessel and {{normally}} carried at {{the bow of the}} vessel. A kedge <b>anchor</b> is a <b>light</b> <b>anchor</b> used for warping an anchor, also known as kedging, or more commonly on yachts for mooring quickly or in benign conditions. A stream anchor, which is usually heavier than a kedge anchor, can be used for kedging or warping in addition to temporary mooring and restraining stern movement in tidal conditions or in waters where vessel movement needs to be restricted, such as rivers and channels. [...] A Killick anchor is a small, possibly improvised, anchor.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're all right," [...] Griffiths said. [...] "This rain won't last. We {{can hold}} this course till {{we pick up}} the <b>lights.</b> <b>Anchor</b> in {{thirteen}} fathoms. You'd better overhaul forty-five on a night like this. After that get the gaskets on the mainsail. We won't need it." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{point is}} always the front {{reference}} point and sits on uncorrected track, the anchorage for chords on A point are able to moved to compensate for defects in track geometry, this {{is done by the}} [...] "tower"operator. Depending on chord system the anchorages will be either a wire <b>anchor</b> or a <b>light</b> source.|$|R
50|$|The {{keel length}} of koch was about 10-25 meters (about 30-70 feet). It had 13 {{combination}} ribs, each consisting of several details. The keel {{was also a}} combination of several parts. Bulkheads divided the body into several cross-section compartments. Each compartment (cherdak) served a specific purpose. There invariably were the fore-part compartment used as the crew's quarters, the stern cabin for the captain, and the cargo hold amidships. The koch had a flat deck. A typical koch carried one square sail on one mast. A distinctive peculiarity of the koch was the relatively big size of its square rudder fin which compensated for the special extra-slim design of {{the upper part of}} the rudder. This type of ship had two 70 lb main anchors and, very often, <b>light</b> <b>anchors.</b> Naval historians think that the <b>light</b> <b>anchors</b> could have been used for mooring kochs to the edge of the ice fields.|$|R
2500|$|The Pile <b>Light</b> <b>anchored</b> off Shelly Beach in 1860 was {{destroyed}} in 1976 when it was hit by the Melbourne Trader, a vessel of 7,000 tonnes. The force of the collision snapped the piles at waterline area, the light was sheared off its piles at water level, pushed [...] sideways, and was left hanging precariously on several of the remaining piles.|$|R
50|$|Installation methods differ {{depending}} on soil composition and moisture. Earth anchors are commonly {{driven into the}} ground using a drive rod and impact hammer. Pilot holes are required in denser soils. After an impact driven anchor has been installed, the drive rod is removed and the anchor load-locked, typically by rotating it ninety degrees. For <b>lighter</b> <b>anchors</b> a hand tool is often sufficient.|$|R
60|$|Pulling himself together, {{he seized}} {{the line at}} the bow, and in a few moments the anchor was on board and he picked up the pole. The punt drifted fast up channel while he headed for the bank, but he saw Jake running along the sand and {{presently}} threw the <b>light</b> <b>anchor</b> as far as he could. Jake caught the line and Jim, springing overboard, ran through the water and picked up Carrie.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{developed}} to understand inflationary pressures and stabilization in non-market economies. It is shown {{that in the}} typical planned economy, the endogeneity of the money supply and the over-determination of the system (given that both prices and wages are set by the planners) imply that a permanent increase in wages leads to an ever-increasing monetary overhang. The model also suggests that price liberalization should lead to a price level overshooting provided that wages remain a nominal <b>anchor.</b> In <b>light</b> of the model, the paper reviews the inflation and stabilization experiences of several transition economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The paper concludes that (i) transition economies have suffered from essentially the same inflationary pressures as did planned economies, and (ii) the exchange rate has been more effective than money as a nominal anchor in reducing inflationinflation, stabilization, transition economies,...|$|R

I know what I shall do to-morrow, the first thing—run out a <b>light</b> <b>anchor</b> and kedge the schooner off the beach. And each night when we come ashore in the boat, Mr. Wolf Larsen will be left a prisoner on board. So this will be the last night we have to stand watch, and because of that it will go the easier.” ...|$|R

(He also occasionally anchored America This Morning, a 30-minute ABC News early-morning news program.) During {{his time}} on World News Now. Owens was involved in controversy when the two <b>anchors</b> inappropriately made <b>light</b> of Owen Wilson's suicide attempt on-air and they were reprimanded for this by ABC News. His departure from World News Now was announced during the program's February 29, 2008, broadcast indicating {{he had taken a}} job as a network correspondent.|$|R

60|$|Our young mate, and his sole assistant, Bob Betts, had {{set about}} their work on the stream-cable and <b>anchor,</b> the <b>lightest</b> and most {{manageable}} of all the ground-tackle in the vessel. Both were strong and active, and both were expert {{in the use of}} blocks, purchases, and handspikes; but the day was seen lighting the eastern sky, and the anchor was barely off the gunwale, and ready to be stoppered in the meanwhile the ship still tended in the right direction, the wind had moderated to a mere royal-breeze, and the sea had so far gone down as nearly to leave the vessel without motion. As soon as perfectly convinced of the existence of this favourable state of things, and of its being likely to last, Mark ceased to work, in order to wait for day, telling Bob to discontinue his exertions also. It was fully time, for both of those vigorous and strong-handed men were thoroughly fatigued with the toil of that eventful morning.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} <b>anchored</b> with two <b>lighting</b> measures. One was the {{illumination}} ratio between the task surface illumination and vertical illumination at the evaluative point location. The other was the Vector/Scalar Ratio at the evaluative location point. The first criterion is straight forward and generally accepted. As {{for the second}} criterion, {{there are a number}} of other models including, Cylindrical /Horizontal Illumination Ratio, Vector/Cylindrical Illumination Ratio and Target/Ambient illumination Ratio (TAIR) among others. Vector/Scalar Ratio is probably the most recognized metric. Hence this study adopted this criterion. While other metrics will yield different numeric results, but the essences and trends investigated by this study using Vector/Scalar should be similar.|$|R
50|$|Connie Chung left Sunrise to co-host the NBC News {{prime time}} {{magazine}} 1986 with Roger Mudd. Bob Jamieson served as interim anchor until January 1987, {{when he left}} to host Before Hours, a 15-minute early morning business program produced by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal. Transferring from NBC's Chicago owned-and-operated station WMAQ-TV, Deborah Norville was Sunrise anchor from January 1987 to September 1989, when Faith Daniels took over as <b>anchor.</b> The program's <b>lights</b> were dimmed on and off in the open of the show, after the commercial break {{in the middle of}} the program, and at the close of the show until 1999.|$|R
