5|$|Since {{the storm}} {{weakened}} considerably from its peak intensity, damage {{was much less}} than initially anticipated. In all, damages from the storm amounted to 15billion (2001 JPY, $140million USD). Three people {{were killed by the}} storm, all of whom were found in irrigation ditches. The first fatality was an 81-year-old man, the second was a 30-year-old man who lost control of his car and crashed into <b>a</b> <b>ditch,</b> and the last fatality was a 3-year-old boy who fell in <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> near his home. Two 11-year-old boys, initially reported as missing, were later found in <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> after being swept away by flood waters.|$|E

5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} be such a problem that the owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer would be used to dig <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> at the crash site and what remained of the Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye {{chose his}} own costumes {{and at times}} experimented with {{different}} colours and designs.

50|$|The {{existence}} of this castle was discovered by aerial photography, in 1954, which showed {{the remains of a}} motte and bailey castle with <b>a</b> double <b>ditch</b> around the motte and <b>a</b> single <b>ditch</b> around the bailey.|$|R
5|$|On December 15, 2015, Southwest Airlines Flight 31, a Boeing 737-300, from Houston, Texas, {{exited the}} taxiway and rolled into <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> shortly after {{arriving}} into Nashville as the airplane was entering the terminal ramp. All 138 {{passengers and crew}} were safely evacuated from the plane and bussed into the airport.|$|E
5|$|The castle stands precipitously above a loop of the River North Esk, {{which protects}} it on three sides. This rocky {{promontory}} was breached {{on the north}} side to form <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> giving further protection. The castle is approached from Roslin across this ditch, via a precipitous bridge and through the ruined gatehouse.|$|E
5|$|A {{section of}} the A303 around Weyhill, west of Andover, runs {{alongside}} <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> thought to be constructed during the Bronze Age. Several historic roads converged at Weyhill, which {{is believed to have}} hosted a popular market since the Middle Ages, eventually becoming {{one of the most important}} in England by the 19th century. The market closed in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{from one}} of the two entrances, <b>a</b> <b>ditched</b> avenue led to a large sub-circular {{enclosure}} some 30M. across in the centre of the fort. The enclosure may have contained a timber shrine as is thought to have existed at Danebury.|$|R

5|$|Appeals {{from the}} local people led to the Crown agreeing in July 1402 to build an earthen rampart and towers to protect the settlement. The site of these early defences is not known but may have been near where St Catherine's Church now stands. <b>A</b> <b>ditch</b> of unknown date in that {{vicinity}} may represent a fragment of the medieval defences.|$|E
5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians {{fell back}} to the barracks and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|Between 1793 and 1795, Saint Lucian Tower and its battery were {{strengthened}} with <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> and an entrenchment-like enclosure, and {{the complex}} was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. Most of the fortifications, {{with the exception}} of the tower itself, were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into disuse.|$|E
5000|$|... 1777-January of this year, Committee on Fortifications reports {{note that}} <b>a</b> <b>ditched</b> {{pentagonal}} fort with 15 embrasures stood at Hull. Supported by two detached water batteries, the fort still needed a glacis, powder magazine, guardhouse, and several barracks. A military hospital was {{located near the}} fort.|$|R

50|$|A tumulus named Castell Poeth ("the Hot Castle") {{is located}} nearby. It is an {{exploratory}} castelet {{with an occasional}} beacon. Described as <b>a</b> <b>ditched,</b> raised enclosure, oval in shape, and measuring 30 m by 60 m across, it has an attached second oval measuring 46 m by 54 m.|$|R
5|$|Despite massive {{flooding}} and damage to entire neighborhoods, {{there were no}} drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in an elevator. Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> in Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2billion (2001USD, $6billion 2007USD) throughout Texas.|$|E
5|$|On January 14, 2015, a GO bus on Highway 407 near Weston Road hit a {{guard rail}} and rolled into <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> One {{passenger}} was ejected and crushed to death, and another two {{in addition to}} the bus driver were injured. On March 2, 2015, the GO Transit driver was charged with careless driving causing death.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury's known history commences in the Early Middle Ages, {{having been}} founded c. 800 AD. It is {{believed}} that Anglo-Saxon Shrewsbury was most probably a settlement fortified {{through the use of}} earthworks comprising <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> and rampart, which were then shored up with a wooden stockade. There is evidence to show that {{by the beginning of the}} 900s, Shrewsbury was home to a mint.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>a</b> <b>ditching</b> {{or water}} landing, podded engines {{hanging from the}} wing {{increase}} the stress on the wing by {{increasing the amount of}} drag caused by the water. This can cause the wings to shear off or flip the aircraft and destroy the fuselage as happened to Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961.|$|R
40|$|Given {{here are}} results of tests made in calm water at various landing attitudes, speeds, and {{simulated}} conditions of damage. It {{was concluded that}} the best ditching could be made by contacting the water as near the stall angle as possible without losing adequate control. The landing flaps should be full down. If the paratainer hatch and aft-cargo doors fail as expected in <b>a</b> <b>ditching,</b> {{there will be a}} large inrush of water into the cargo compartment which makes this location <b>a</b> very hazardous <b>ditching</b> station. The airplane will settle in the water rapidly {{to the level of the}} wings with only gradual changes in attitude. The maximum longitudinal deceleration will be between 1. 2 g and 1. 7 g in <b>a</b> calm-water <b>ditching...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open in <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b> The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a temporary bridge across the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get across and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced across the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|The Great Circle was {{surrounded}} by <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> and is accompanied by smaller stone circles to the north east and south west. There is also {{a group of three}} stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's Quoit. Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E
5|$|The next {{proposal}} {{to build a}} fortification on the island {{was made by the}} Italian military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga in 1670. He proposed a roughly hexagonal fort with a hornwork, in the Dutch style of fortification. The proposal was criticized by the Order's engineers, and a third proposal was drawn up by the Flemish military engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh in 1687. Grunenburgh's proposal consisted of a fort with four bastions and a ravelin, surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>ditch,</b> covertway and faussebraye.|$|E
50|$|The fort has <b>a</b> <b>ditched</b> {{pentagonal}} perimeter, {{with the}} perimeter wall and parapet being built from earth excavated during {{the building of}} the ditch. The cliffs on the seaward side were also used as part of the fort's defensive perimeter. Fort Benghisa was the last polygonal fort that the British built in Malta.|$|R
50|$|Like its {{opposite}} counterpart, the Old Baile was of motte and bailey design. The motte was approximately 40 feet (12 m) high and 180 feet (66 m) in diameter, and {{was surrounded by}} <b>a</b> large <b>ditch.</b> <b>A</b> flight of steps led to a wooden structure at the top which {{was surrounded by a}} fence, also made of wood. The bailey lay to the north-west of the motte and was rectangular. Around its perimeter was an earth rampart and <b>an</b> outer <b>ditch.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{listed site}} {{included}} five contributing structures and two contributing sites on 15 acre. It {{consists of the}} remains of more than 30 terraces, <b>an</b> irrigation <b>ditch,</b> <b>a</b> root cellar, three rock cairns, and scattered artifacts of Chinese origin.|$|R
