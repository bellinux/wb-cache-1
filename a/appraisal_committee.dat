The cascades of dams planned across the Lohit, Dibang River in the Brahmaputra River , the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi River in the Ganga basin and the Teesta in Sikkim for example, {{would end up in}} the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)) on releasing e-flows from dams.

They recommended that large scale trials be allowed to go ahead. In 2009, a second expert committee (EC-II) examined the data from these trials.

40|$|Background NICE is an {{independent}} organisation responsible for providing national guidance on the promotion of good health and the prevention and treatment of ill health in England and Wales. One of NICE’s main roles is to produce national guidance {{on the use of}} health technologies within the NHS. Despite the Institute’s recent efforts to clarify the way in which its <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committees</b> reach their recommendations concerning the use of health technologies, there remains ambiguity about how cost-effectiveness evidence is interpreted alongside other considerations such as the degree of clinical need within the patient population, and the degree of uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness estimates. Objective To explore whether the NICE takes account of factors such as uncertainty and equity as well as incremental cost-effectiveness in commissioning health care services. Methods A binary choice experiment was undertaken using NICE’s three <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committees.</b> The experiment included five attributes: (1) Incremental cost-effectiveness (2) Degree of economic uncertainty (3) Age of the target population (4) Baseline health-related quality of life (5) Availability of other therapies A choice questionnaire detailing 18 scenarios was administered to NICE’s <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committees.</b> For each scenario, respondents were asked to indicate whether they would recommend the intervention under consideration or not. The stated preference data obtained from respondents were analysed using a random effects logit regression model. Results A response rate of 46 % was obtained from the <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committees.</b> The regression model suggests that increases in cost-effectiveness, economic uncertainty, and the availability of other therapies are associated with statistically significant reductions in the odds of adoption (p< 0. 05). The transition from a very low to a comparatively high level of health-related quality of life is also associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of a positive recommendation. Smaller changes in health-related quality of life, and the age of the target population are not associated with a statistically significant reduction in the odds of a positive recommendation. Analysis of revealed preference data indicates that the model is capable of distinguishing between those technologies which the <b>Appraisal</b> <b>Committees</b> would be highly likely to recommend, and those technologies which appear to be less attractive, although further external validation is warranted. Conclusion The modelling suggests that cost-effectiveness, uncertainty and certain equity concerns influence the NICE Appraisal Committees’ recommendations on the use of health technologies. The modelling results appear to support Rawlins and Culyer’s notion of a probabilistic cost-effectiveness threshold approach; the “mythical” £ 30, 000 per QALY gained threshold assumed within the literature is not supported by this stated preference modelling analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDecisions {{about the}} use of new {{technologies}} in health care are often based on complex economic models. Decision makers frequently make informal judgments about evidence, uncertainty, and the assumptions that underpin these models. ObjectivesTransparent interactive decision interrogator (TIDI) facilitates more formal critique of decision models by decision makers such as members of <b>appraisal</b> <b>committees</b> of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK. By allowing them to run advanced statistical models under different scenarios in real time, TIDI can make the decision process more efficient and transparent, while avoiding limitations on pre-prepared analysis. MethodsTIDI, programmed in Visual Basic for applications within Excel, provides an interface for controlling all components of a decision model developed in the appropriate software (e. g., meta-analysis in WinBUGS and the decision model in R) by linking software packages using RExcel and R 2 WinBUGS. TIDI's graphical controls allow the user to modify assumptions and to run the decision model, and results are returned to an Excel spreadsheet. A tool displaying tornado plots helps to evaluate the influence of individual parameters on the model outcomes, and an interactive meta-analysis module allows the user to select any combination of available studies, explore the impact of bias adjustment, and view results using forest plots. We demonstrate TIDI using an example of a decision model in antenatal care. ConclusionUse of TIDI during the NICE appraisal of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (in psoriatic arthritis) successfully demonstrated its ability to facilitate critiques of the decision models by decision makers...|$|R
