The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it. [...] It was a great tribute {{that he was able}} to ask me and accept my opinion on it." ...|$|E
500|$|By January 1969, {{the single}} [...] "If I Can Dream", {{written for the}} special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album broke into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special {{reminded}} Presley of what [...] "he {{had not been able}} to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.... He was out of prison, man." [...] Binder said of Presley's reaction, [...] "I played Elvis the 60-minute show, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{attempted}} {{to patch up}} the marriage in January 1951 by inviting Northrup and baby Alexis to Palm Springs, California where he had rented a house. The situation soon became tense again; Richard de Mille, nephew of the famous director Cecil B. de Mille, recalled that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} turmoil and dissension in the Foundation at the time; he kept accusing Communists of trying to take control and he was having difficulties with Northrup. It was clear their marriage was breaking up – she was very critical of him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she was fooling around with Hollister and he didn't trust her." [...] Hubbard enlisted de Mille and another Dianeticist, Dave Williams, in an attempt to convince her to stay with him. John Sanborne, who worked with Hubbard for many years, recalled: ...|$|E

500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found it nice to have [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> how he was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E

On October 3, Boehner once again recanted, this time telling a radio interviewer [...] "I believe I talked to the Speaker <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it had been taken care of." ...|$|E
5000|$|The episode {{introduces}} Marshall Lee, {{voiced by}} Donald Glover (of Community fame). His character delivers a performance in both melody and spoken word. Regarding his role, Ward said, [...] "Donald is the bomb. He's got awesome funny chops and singing chops and we spotlight all his chops in the episode. I was super stoked when <b>he</b> came in, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he's</b> super stoked {{to have worked}} on it, which makes me extra stoked". Harris (of How I Met Your Mother fame), guest stars as Prince Gumball, also introduced in [...] "Fionna and Cake".|$|R

But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you." [...] He told me he wanted me for Gallipoli {{a couple of years}} later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had Mark Lee, the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted {{something}} of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to of their own time.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'.

I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets IV is the {{grandson}} of Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., the pilot of the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You seem to be very interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Petrović needed new challenges, which Cibona and the Yugoslavian League {{could not}} offer. Across the Atlantic, the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA had already used their third round pick on young Petrović in 1986. However, {{he decided to}} {{postpone}} his departure to the United States. In 1988, he signed with Real Madrid instead, for at that time a hefty sum of around US$4 million. The transfer wasn't without controversy as the Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players weren't allowed to professionally move abroad until reaching 28 years of age, while Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with the famous Madrid club. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who {{played a key role}} in Petrović's summer 1988 transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from this transaction: [...] "I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen's coach at Cibona, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it'll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up in order to circumvent this law".|$|E
2500|$|Love {{remembers that}} Capitol's working {{title for the}} album was Our Freaky Friends, and that the label planned the cover shoot at the zoo, with the animals {{representing}} the group's [...] "freaky friends". In May, the San Diego Union reported that the group [...] "came down from Hollywood to take a cover picture for their forthcoming album Our Freaky Friends.... Zoo officials were not keen about having their beloved beasts connected with {{the title of the}} album, but gave in when the Beach Boys explained that animals are an 'in' thing with teenagers. And that the Beach Boys were rushing to beat the rock and roll group called The Animals." [...] Asher remembered: [...] " [...] had some proofs of the pictures they'd done at the zoo, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> they were thinking of calling the album Pet Sounds. I thought it was a goofy name for an album – I thought it trivialized what we had accomplished." [...] Until arriving to the photo shoot, Jardine thought that [...] "pet" [...] referred to slang for making out ("petting"). Jardine also expressed disappointment with the chosen cover, believing it was [...] "crazy" [...] to go to the zoo, that [...] "the art department screwed up pretty badly on that one... wanted a more sensitive and enlightening cover." [...] Author Peter Doggett writes that the design was at odds with the increasingly sophisticated cover portraits used on releases by artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan over 1965–67. He highlights it as [...] "a warning of what could happen when music and image parted company: songs of high romanticism, an album cover of stark banality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
