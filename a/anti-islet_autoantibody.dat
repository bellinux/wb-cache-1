40|$|OBJECTIVE To define {{cellular}} {{mechanisms by}} which B cells promote type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study measured islet-specific CD 4 T cell regulation in T-cell receptor transgenic mice with elevated frequencies of CD 4 T cells recognizing hen egg lysozyme (HEL) autoantigen expressed in islet β-cells and thymic epithelium under control of the insulin-gene promoter. The effects of a mutation in Roquin that dysregulates T follicular helper (Tfh) cells to promote B-cell activation and <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> were studied, as were the effects of HEL antigen–presenting B cells and passively transferred or maternally transmitted anti-islet HEL antibodies. RESULTS Mouse anti-islet IgG antibodies—either formed {{as a consequence of}} excessive Tfh activity, maternally transmitted, or passively transferred—caused a breakdown of tolerance in islet-reactive CD 4 + cells and fast progression to diabetes. Progression to diabetes was ameliorated in the absence of B cells or when the B cells could not secrete islet-specific IgG. Anti-islet antibodies increased the survival of proliferating islet-reactive CD 4 + T cells. FcγR blockade delayed and reduced the incidence of autoimmune diabetes. CONCLUSIONS B cells can promote type 1 diabetes by secreting <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> that act in an Fcγ R -mediated manner to enhance the expansion of islet-reactive CD 4 T cells and cooperate with inherited defects in thymic and peripheral CD 4 T–cell tolerance. Cooperation between inherited variants affecting CD 4 T–cell tolerance and <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> should be examined in epidemiological studies and in studies examining the efficacy of B-cell depletion...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—Interferon therapy {{can trigger}} {{induction}} of several autoimmune diseases, in-cluding {{type 1 diabetes}}. To assess the clinical, immunologic, and genetic characteristics of type 1 diabetes induced by interferon therapy, we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS—Clinical characteristics, <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies,</b> and HLA-DR typing were examined in 91 patients for whom type 1 diabetes developed during or shortly after interferon therapy. RESULTS—Median age {{at the onset of}} type 1 diabetes was 56 (interquartile range 48 – 63) years and mean 6 SD BMI was 20. 8 6 2. 7 kg/m 2. The time period from the initiation of interferon therapy to type 1 diabetes onset in patients receiving pegylated interferon and ribavirin was significantly shorter than that in patients with nonpegylated interferon single therapy (P, 0. 05). <b>Anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> were detected in 94. 5 % of patients at diabetes onset. Type 1 diabetes susceptibility HLA-DRs in the Japanese population, DR 4 and DR 9, were also associated with interferon treatment–related type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, the prevalence of HLA-DR 13 was significantly higher in interferon treatment–related type 1 diabetes than in healthy control sub-jects (odds ratio 3. 80 [95 %CI 2. 20 – 7. 55]; P, 0. 0001) and classical type 1 diabetes (2. 15 [1. 17...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Type	 1 	diabetes	(T 1 D) 	 is	an	organ-specific	autoimmune	disease	caused	by	the	autoimmune {{response}} against	pancreatic	β	cells. T 1 D	is	often	complicated	with	other	autoimmune	diseases,	 and <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b>	precede	the	clinical	onset	of	disease. The	most	common	coexisting	organ-specific autoimmune	disease	in	patients	with	T 1 D	is	autoimmune	thyroid	disease,	 and	its	frequency	is estimated at>	 90 %	 among	patients	with	T 1 D	and	autoimmune	diseases. The	prevalence	of	anti-thyroid antibodies in	children	with	T 1 D	at	disease	onset	is	about	 20 %	 and	is	particularly	common	in	girls. Furthermore,	 patients	with	anti-thyroid	antibodies	are	 18 	times	more	likely	to	develop	thyroid	disease than patients	without	anti-thyroid	antibodies. Therefore,	 for	early	detection	of	autoimmune	thyroid disease in	children	with	T 1 D,	 measurement	of	anti-thyroid	antibodies	and	TSH	at	T 1 D	onset	and	in yearly intervals	after	the	age	of	 12 	yr	is	recommended. <b>Anti-islet</b>	<b>autoantibodies</b>	are	predictive	and diagnostic markers	for	T 1 D. The	most	frequently	detected	autoantibodies	in	Japanese	patients	are GAD autoantibodies	(~ 80 %) 	 followed	by	IA- 2 	autoantibodies	(~ 60 %),	 insulin	autoantibodies	(~ 55 %) and ZnT 8 	autoantibodies	(~ 50 %). 	In	a	combined	analysis,	 94 %	 of	Japanese	patients	with	T 1 D	can	be defined as	having	type	 1 A	diabetes. Furthermore,	 autoantibodies	to	ZnT 8 	and	IA- 2 	are	associated with childhood-onset	and	acute-onset	patients.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell mediated destruction of pancreatic ﾎｲ-cells. In Japanese population, {{the incidence of}} type 1 diabetes in children is very low compared to European countries. However, there are more patients with type 1 diabetes in adults, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). A variety of environmental and genetic factors {{are involved in the}} development of the disease. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes (termed IDDM 1) are the major genes associated with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. HLA-DRB 1 * 0405 -DQB 1 * 0401, HLA-DRB 1 * 0901 -DQB 1 * 0303 and HLA-DRB 1 * 0802 -DQB 1 * 0302 are three major haplotypes in Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes. Other genetic factors reported in Japanese type 1 diabetes include the polymorphisms in insulin gene (IDDM 2), CTLA- 4 gene (IDDM 12), MICA gene, Neuro D/Beta 2 gene, and IL- 10 gene. The circulating autoantibodies to multiple islet autoantigens including GAD, insulin, and IA- 2 are the important immunological features of type 1 diabetes. The prevalences of <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> in patients with Japanese type 1 diabetes are 60 - 70 % for GAD autoantibodies, 45 - 50 % for insulin autoantibodies (IAA), and 60 - 65 % for IA- 2 autoantibodies at disease onset, which are similar to those reported in Caucasian patients. With combinatorial analysis of these autoantibodies ninety percent of patients express at least one of these autoantibodies and are classified as immune-mediated type 1 diabetes. Although the majority of patients with type 1 diabetes are young, lean, and ketosisprone, there are number of patients with type 1 diabetes initially diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes at disease onset. These slow-onset diabetic patients with <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies</b> often progress toward insulin-deficient state within several years after diagnosis. High level of GAD autoantibodies has a high predictive value for future insulin deficiency in slow-onset patients with type 1 diabetes. In conclusion, Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes are clinically heterogenous and the determination of immunological and genetic features are helpful to clarify the characteristics of the Japanese type 1 diabetic syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{autoantibody}} production is largely unknown outside of associations {{located in the}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. The {{aim of this study}} is the discovery of new genetic associations with autoantibody positivity using genome-wide association scan single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) patients with autoantibody measurements. We measured two <b>anti-islet</b> <b>autoantibodies,</b> glutamate decarboxylase (GADA, n = 2, 506), insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA- 2 A, n = 2, 498), antibodies to the autoimmune thyroid (Graves') disease (AITD) autoantigen thyroid peroxidase (TPOA, n = 8, 300), and antibodies against gastric parietal cells (PCA, n = 4, 328) that are associated with autoimmune gastritis. Two loci passed a stringent genome-wide significance level (p< 10 - 10) : 1 q 23 /FCRL 3 with IA- 2 A and 9 q 34 /ABO with PCA. Eleven of 52 non-MHC T 1 D loci showed evidence of association with at least one autoantibody at a false discovery rate of 16 : 16 p 11 /IL 27 -IA- 2 A, 2 q 24 /IFIH 1 -IA- 2 A and PCA, 2 q 32 /STAT 4 -TPOA, 10 p 15 /IL 2 RA-GADA, 6 q 15 /BACH 2 -TPOA, 21 q 22 /UBASH 3 A-TPOA, 1 p 13 /PTPN 22 -TPOA, 2 q 33 /CTLA 4 -TPOA, 4 q 27 /IL 2 /TPOA, 15 q 14 /RASGRP 1 /TPOA, and 12 q 24 /SH 2 B 3 -GADA and TPOA.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the proportion of circulating B cells expressing the differentiative antigen CD 5 was increased in children affected by type 1 diabetes, and whether the number of these cells was correlated with the presence of <b>anti-islet</b> cell <b>autoantibodies.</b> Sixteen children affected by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1) were investigated for the presence of B lymphocytes bearing the CD 5 surface molecule, T-cell-specific activation markers, organ- and nonorgan-specific autoantibodies. The number of CD 5 +CD 19 + cells was higher in type 1 children with a very recent onset of the disease, as compared with patients on insulin therapy for more than 30 days and controls (P < 0. 05). No correlation was found between the number of CD 5 +CD 19 + cells and the presence of either organ- or nonorgan-specific autoantibodies. Our results indicate that CD 5 +CD 19 + cells are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in children. A potential immunoregulatory role of this B cell population is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} {{the case of a}} 43 -year-old woman affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 8 years before, who developed Graves' disease 2 years after chemotherapy and mantle radiotherapy treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Bilateral Graves' ophthalmopathy appeared four months before our observations. Intravenous methyl-prednisolone therapy was started, but was interrupted due to severe metabolic failure. <b>Autoantibodies</b> (<b>anti-islet</b> cells, anti-thyroid, thyroid-stimulating, non-organ-specific) were positive. Since the clinical picture suggested a genetic immunological ground predisposing to autoimmunity, we evaluated her HLA haplotype. Genomic typing of the patient permitted identification of the 8. 1 ancestral haplotype, a Caucasoid haplotype unique in its association with many immunopathological diseases. Moreover, we also observed a haplotype unusual in Caucasians, trans DRB 1 * 1101, DQA 1 * 0103, DQB 1 * 0603. To our knowledge, HLA-related genetic risk of developing thyroid autoimmunity after neck irradiation has never been studied. Although we cannot confirm a direct association between the 8. 1 ancestral haplotype or DRB 1 * 1101, DQA 1 * 0103, DQB 1 * 0603 and the diseases described, we suggest considering immunological parameters and HLA typing in candidate patients for mantle radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease or other tumors. HLA haplotype determination could be useful in identifying the patients at raised risk of developing autoimmune diseases after irradiation, thus permitting a more appropriate follow-up schedule...|$|R

Se encuestaron y se registraron algunas características clínicas. Se dividieron en 2 grupos según la presencia de ICA. Todos los diabéticos tipo 2 + para autoanticuerpos antiislotes (ICA y/o anti-GAD 65) fueron identificados como LADA. Se detectó el 3, 4 % de diabético tipo 2 con ICA +, en los diabéticos tipo 2 ICA- el 22, 0 % presentó anticuerpos anti-GAD 65. Se encontró que los diabéticos tipo 2 ICA+ eran más jóvenes, la duración de su diabetes era menor, presentaron menor IMC, disminución de los niveles de péptido C en ayunas, menos antecedentes familiares (padres) de DM 2, valores menores en las tensiones arteriales diastólicas y sistólicas, mayor presencia de anticuerpos anti-GAD 65, AMT y AGP en comparación con los diabéticos tipo 2 ICA-. Se observó que los diabéticos tipo 2 ICA+ (LADA) tienen características específicas que los asemejan a los diabéticos tipo 1, esto implicaría variaciones importantes en su tratamiento y evolución con respecto a los diabéticos tipo 2 ICA-. Se observó una baja frecuencia de ICA y alta de GAD en los diabéticos tipo 2 cubanos, las cuales fueron diferentes a la encontrada en poblaciones caucasianas. Los anticuerpos anti-GAD 65 fueron superiores a los ICA para detectar los LADA. Las características clínicas e inmunológicas de estos pacientes muestran la lenta progresión de la destrucción autoinmune de las células b con implicaciones terapéuticas. This {{paper was}} aimed at knowing the frequency, clinico-biochemical, immunologic and genetic characteristics of autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) in 1 000 type 2 diabetic patients aged 35 or over with different times of duration of diabetes. Glycemia, anti-pancreatic islet cell antibodies (ICA), anti-GAD 65 antibodies, anti-ICA 512 bdc/IA 2 antibodies, anti-microsomal thyroid antibodies (AMT), anti-gastric parietal antibodies (AGP), antinuclear antibodies (AN), microalbuminuria and peptide C during fasting were determined. These patients were surveyed and some clinical characteristics were registered. They were divided into 2 groups {{according to the presence}} of ICA. All the type 2 + diabetics for <b>anti-islet</b> cell <b>autoantibodies</b> (ICA and/or antiGAD 65) were identified as LADA. 3. 4 % of type 2 ICA + were detected. 22. 0 % of type 2 ICA - diabetics had anti-GAD 65 antibodies. It was found that type 2 ICA + diabetics were younger, that their diabetes was shorter, that they had lower BMI, reduced levels of fasting peptide C, less DM 2 history family (parents), lower values of diastolic and systolic arterial pressure, higher presence of anti-GAD 65 antibodies, AMT and AGP in comparison with type 2 ICA - diabetics. It was observed that type 2 ICA+ diabetics (LADA) have specific characteristics that make them similar to type 1 diabetics, which would lead to important variations in their treatment and evolution as regards type 2 ICA - diabetics. Among the Cuban type 2 diabetics it was detected a low frequency of ICA and a high frequency of GAD, which were different to those found in the Caucasian populations.
