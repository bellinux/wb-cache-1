5|$|Among heterodontosaurids, only Heterodontosaurus {{itself is}} known from a {{complete}} skeleton. Fragmentary skeletal remains of Abrictosaurus are known {{but have not}} been fully described, while most other heterodontosaurids are known only from jaw fragments <b>and</b> <b>teeth.</b> Consequently, most heterodontosaurid synapomorphies (defining features) have been described from the teeth and jaw bones. Heterodontosaurus measured just over 1meter (3.3ft) in length, while the fragmentary remains of Lycorhinus may indicate a larger individual.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in their skull <b>and</b> <b>teeth,</b> {{it was later}} thought that monkey lemurs (Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur) were a sister group to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs (family Palaeopropithecidae). However, there was some debate over whether the monkey lemurs or the sloth lemurs were {{more closely related to}} today's indriids. The monkey lemurs had skulls that more closely resembled the indriids, but their teeth were very specialized and unlike those of the indriids. The sloth lemurs, on the other hand, had teeth like the indriids, but very specialized skulls. The matter was settled with the discovery of new skeletons of Babakotia and Mesopropithecus, two genera of sloth lemur, both of which had indriid-like skulls <b>and</b> <b>teeth.</b> More recently, postcranial remains of Hadropithecus found in the early 2000s prompted the suggestion that the monkey lemurs were more closely related to the lemurids. However, DNA sequencing has reaffirmed the sister group status of the monkey lemurs to indriids and sloth lemurs.|$|E

5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence gray wolf craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium <b>and</b> <b>teeth</b> due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus atacis {{is known}} from a {{specimen}} from the Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation. More specifically, {{it is known}} from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only has a few elements of plants and invertebrates. The vertebrates consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments <b>and</b> <b>teeth</b> of a crocodile, isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus.

5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they faulted north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here.

5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings <b>and</b> <b>teeth,</b> though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails of their ancestors, the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between skin color (shade) <b>and</b> <b>tooth</b> shade under standard and nonstandard illumination sources. Materials and Methods: Four hundred Jordanian participants (200 males, 200 females, 20 to 50 years of age) were studied. Skin colors were assessed and categorized using the L’Oreal and Revlon foundation shade guides (light, medium, dark). The Vita Pan Classical Shade Guide (VPCSG; Vident) and digital Vita EasyShade Intraoral Dental Spectrophotometer (VESIDS; Vident) were used to select shades in the middle thirds of maxillary central incisors; tooth shades were classified into four categories (highest, high, medium, low). Results: Significant gender differences were observed for skin colors (P =. 000) <b>and</b> <b>tooth</b> shade guide systems (P =. 001 and. 050 for VPCSG and VESIDS, respectively). The observed agreement was 100 % and 93 % for skin <b>and</b> <b>tooth</b> shade guides, respectively. The corresponding kappa statistic values were 1. 00 and 0. 79, respectively (substantial agreement, P <. 001). The observed agreement between skin color <b>and</b> <b>tooth</b> shades (VPCSG <b>and</b> VESIDS) was approximately 50 %. Conclusions: The digital tooth shade guide system can be a satisfactory substitute for classical <b>tooth</b> shade guides <b>and</b> clinical shade matching. There was only moderate agreement between skin color <b>and</b> <b>tooth</b> shade...|$|R
5|$|Lead affects {{every one}} of the body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, but also the bones <b>and</b> <b>teeth,</b> the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems. Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to lead exposure, as have cataracts. Intrauterine and neonatal lead exposure promote tooth decay. Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems <b>and</b> <b>teeth</b> adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones <b>and</b> <b>teeth,</b> but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, <b>and</b> <b>teeth)</b> are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} is {{harmless}} to humans {{because of its}} small size <b>and</b> <b>teeth.</b> Caught using longlines, gillnets, trawls, and hook-and-line, this shark is marketed fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, and is also used for shark fin soup and fishmeal. Its abundance makes it a significant component of artisanal and commercial fisheries across its range. Off northern Australia, it ranks among the most common sharks caught in trawls, and comprises 2% and 6% of the annual gillnet and longline catches, respectively. This species {{is also one of}} the most commercially important sharks caught off Senegal, Mauritania, Oman, and India. Some sport fishers regard it as a game fish.|$|E
