25|$|White {{concludes with}} a mixed verdict. The transcontinentals did open up the West to settlement, brought in many {{thousands}} of high-tech, highly paid workers and managers, created thousands of towns and cities, oriented the nation onto an east–west axis, and proved highly valuable for {{the nation as a}} whole. On the other hand, too many were built, and they were built too far ahead of <b>actual</b> <b>demand.</b> The result was a bubble that left heavy losses to investors, and led to poor management practices. By contrast, as White notes, the lines in the Midwest and East supported by a very large population base, fostered farming, industry and mining while generating steady profits and receiving few government benefits.|$|E
25|$|Both {{these factors}} {{were related to}} a failure by the Modernisation Plan to {{successfully}} redfine what {{the purpose of the}} railways were - British Railways remained bound by its legal status as a common carrier, which obligated it to provide carriage for virtually any type of goods, regardless of quantity (large or small) from any two stations on the network, at set and published rates. This legislation dated back to the 19th century to prevent the railways abusing their monopoly as the sole practical long-distance transport provider for much of the country but the growth of road transport had left the railways locked into a highly disadvantageous position. Road freight operators had no legal restrictions and could turn down work that was uneconomic, which BR could not, and could easily undercut BR's carriage rates which the railway could not alter without legal consent. The common carrier requirements also saddled BR with the necessity to maintain thousands of goods yards and other facilities, plus rolling stock and staff to service them, even when there was ever-decreasing <b>actual</b> <b>demand</b> for such services and such traffic as did exist was very rarely profitable. This issue had been identified during the Great Depression and the Big Four had campaigned for repeal of the common carrier legislation as a 'Fair Deal' during the 1930s. However this did not happen until the Transport Act 1962 gave BR freedom of contract - until then the Modernisation Plan had to commission locomotives, rolling stock and facilities to manage the ever-declining but legally-required wagonload freight traffic.|$|E
500|$|This {{method for}} {{computing}} the price elasticity {{is also known}} as the [...] "midpoints formula", because the average price and average quantity are the coordinates of the midpoint of the straight line between the two given points. This formula is an application of the midpoint method.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of evolutionary biology, the functional capacity of an organ should match the demands imposed upon it. Functional capacities {{in excess of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>demands</b> cost energy through maintenance of underutilized organ size and function. Insufficient capacity restricts the ability to exploit the full extent of resources, even if resources are available in unlimited supply. This hypothesis rests on two major assumptions. First, the energy budget of an individual is limited, and the maintenance of unutilized capacities costs a measurable/significant portion of its biosynthetic energy budget. Second, mismatching reduces fitness relative to individuals with optimized organ design, because of energetic costs. Therefore, individuals ought to respond to changes in the <b>actual</b> <b>demands</b> by adjusting their functional capacities (Diamond and Hammond, 1992; Diamond, 1998; Hammond, 1998; Weibel...|$|R

500|$|A second {{solution}} to the asymmetry problem of having a PED dependent on {{which of the two}} given points on a demand curve is chosen as the [...] "original" [...] point will and which as the [...] "new" [...] one is to compute the percentage change in P and Q relative to the average of the two prices and the average of the two quantities, rather than just the change relative to one point or the other.

2500|$|Michael Spence {{wrote that}} [...] "Now comes a … powerful, wave of digital {{technology}} that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading {{to the production of}} goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor." [...] In his view, {{the vast majority of the}} cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more important, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. [...] "Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [...] are compelling." [...] Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies [...] "is cost reduction via the replacement of labor." [...] For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is [...] "easy to imagine" [...] that production may become [...] "extremely" [...] local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to <b>actual</b> <b>demand,</b> not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that [...] "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution." ...|$|E

5000|$|The InSync {{processor}} is {{a modern}} state machine, which means it can dynamically choose which traffic phases to serve and instantly adjust and coordinate service and green time at each intersection’s phase. InSync outperforms predetermined signal timing plans which usually estimate traffic demand based on a small historical sampling and generalize those results across years of traffic signalization. InSync relies on detectors and artificial intelligence to move traffic efficiently. In effect, InSync makes decisions as a traffic engineer would: accepting inputs of <b>actual</b> traffic <b>demand,</b> determining phase priority based on occupancy and delay, and anticipating and coordinating traffic along the entire corridor. This complex decision-making process happens instantly, constantly and in real-time, as the system adapts moment by moment to <b>actual</b> <b>demands</b> on the road.
