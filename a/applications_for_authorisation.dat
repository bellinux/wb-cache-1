50|$|TV {{detection}} {{is a form}} of {{covert surveillance}} and as such is regulated by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). More specifically, the BBC's use of surveillance is defined by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (British Broadcasting Corporation) Order 2001. Like other public bodies that undertake covert surveillance, the BBC is subject to the scrutiny of the Office of Surveillance Commissioners, which inspects the BBC every other year. A number of official inspection reports on the BBC's detection methods have been made available following freedom of information requests These reports give an outline of the process of authorisation of the use of detection equipment. Briefly, <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> are made {{in the name of the}} Detection Manager. Correspondence between TV Licensing and the affected householder may be attached to the completed application forms which pass via a quality control 'gatekeeper' to the authorising officers (AOs) at the BBC. In 2012 there were two designated AOs at the BBC. To be authorised, an application must be shown to be 'necessary and proportionate'. AOs sometimes reject applications. Once approved, the authorisation lasts for a duration of eight weeks.|$|E

40|$|Over {{its first}} three {{mandates}} the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA Panel) has provided scientific advice {{on a range}} of issues related to human nutrition. The scientific outputs adopted over this time are summarised within the six main areas within the remit of the Panel: (i) tolerable upper intake levels for nutrients; (ii) safety of novel foods; (iii) food allergens; (iv) dietetic products; (v) population reference intakes for nutrients; and (vi) nutrition and health claims on foods. The scientific advice of the Panel was provided mainly in response to requests from the European Commission and <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> of novel foods, health claims and for exemption from allergen labelling. The outputs of the Panel have been extensively used by the European Commission and Member States in the implementation of European Union (EU) policy and legislation. In addition, some of the scientific opinions assess key elements of the evidence on nutrition in obesity and other diet related diseases and are an important source of scientific advice for policy makers who wish to address these important issues in public health. Throughout the different areas of its work, the Panel has placed considerable focus on consultation with stakeholders. In the area of health claims in particular, EFSA has had continuing consultation with stakeholders in developing extensive guidance for applicants.

Since then, the NDA Panel has gained considerable experience {{in the evaluation of}} health claims. Lessons learnt from these experiences have been translated into a new General scientific guidance for stakeholders on health claim applications (published in January 2016). In this context, it is noted the need to adapt the existing guidance to the new scientific and technical developments in this area. This guidance document presents a common format for the organisation of information for the preparation of a well-structured <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> of health claims which fall under Articles 13 (5), 14 and 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1924 / 2006.

30|$|In addition, as {{put forward}} by first {{reactions}} to the legal appraisal, when preparing the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation,</b> EEA based producers of articles can use the structured system of downstream and upstream information and communication concerning chemical substance risks, established by Title IV REACH (‘Information in the Supply Chain’) [23]. In most third countries national chemicals legislation does not provide comparable information and communication tools {{that can be used}} by article producers applying <b>for</b> REACH <b>authorisation.</b> One could argue that this constellation might detrimentally affect the competitive opportunities of foreign producers. The latter are, however, free to join forces and cooperate with their foreign suppliers or other importers based on a model such as REACH. To put such a system into effect, they have to spend resources. They might, however, allocate the resources which they have saved in the first place for not being obliged under the REACH downstream and upstream information and communication system. With a view to the upcoming <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>authorisation</b> foreign producers have the opportunity to focus their expenditures on the specific relevant requirements. The domestic producers, on the other hand, are obliged to co-finance the entire REACH system (e.g. registration fees are the core funding of ECHA). Hence one could argue that foreign producers are even advantaged. In sum, there is no detrimental impact and therefore no less favourable treatment in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT.|$|R
