5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics <b>and</b> <b>temperament</b> concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{any relationship}} between temperaments of medicinal plants referred to traditional Iranian manuscripts and their major chemical compounds. MethodsPlants used in traditional Iranian medicine were categorized {{based on their}} major chemical compounds including alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and essential oils. Their temperaments were extracted from traditional herbal pharmacopeias of Iran. The possible relationship between major chemical compounds <b>and</b> <b>temperaments</b> of each group were evaluated. ResultsPlants containing phenolic compounds as their major constituents are hot <b>and</b> dry <b>temperaments</b> except those contain tannins with cold <b>and</b> dry <b>temperaments.</b> Plants containing essential oils have hot <b>and</b> dry <b>temperaments</b> except those whose major essential oils with alcoholic structure which have cold <b>and</b> dry <b>temperaments.</b> Alkaloid-containing plants have cold and dry or hot <b>and</b> dry <b>temperaments</b> based on their alkaloidal structures. ConclusionsThere is a close relationship between major chemical compounds of medicinal plants <b>and</b> their <b>temperaments</b> mentioned in traditional Iranian manuscripts...|$|R

5|$|Late in life, Henry became obese, with a waist {{measurement}} of , {{and had to}} be moved about with the help of mechanical inventions. He was covered with painful, pus-filled boils and possibly suffered from gout. His obesity and other medical problems can be traced from the jousting accident in 1536, in which he suffered a leg wound. The accident re-opened and aggravated a previous injury he had sustained years earlier, to the extent that his doctors found it difficult to treat. The wound festered for the remainder of his life and became ulcerated, thus preventing him from maintaining the level of physical activity he had previously enjoyed. The jousting accident is also believed to have caused Henry's mood swings, which may have had a dramatic effect on his personality <b>and</b> <b>temperament.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Earp party rode {{north to}} the Percy Ranch, but were not welcomed by Hugh and Jim Percy, who feared the Cowboys; after a meal and some rest, they left around 3:00 {{in the morning of}} March 27. The Earp party slipped into the area near Tombstone and met with supporters, {{including}} Hairlip Charlie Smith and Warren Earp. On March 27, the posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch owned by Henry Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. That night, Dan Tipton caught the first stage out of Tombstone and headed for Benson, carrying $1,000 from mining owner and Earp supporter E. B. Gage for the posse. Hooker congratulated Earp on the killing of Curly Bill. Hooker fed them and Wyatt told him he wanted to buy new mounts. Hooker was known for his purebred stallions and ran over 500 brood mares that produced horses that became known for their speed, beauty, <b>and</b> <b>temperament.</b> He provided Wyatt and his posse with new mounts, but refused to take Wyatt's money. When Behan's posse was observed in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles (5km) distant near Reilly Hill.|$|E

40|$|Background One of {{the smoking}} risk factors {{influencing}} nicotine dependency may be human personality; however, {{few studies have}} examined the association between Akiskal’s affective <b>temperaments</b> <b>and</b> smoking in adults. Our study aims to evaluate the associations between nicotine dependence <b>and</b> affective <b>temperaments</b> using the TEMPS-A. Participants and procedure The sample in this study consisted of 678 healthy Caucasian adults aged from 17 to 69 years, including 134 self-declared nicotine-dependent subjects (89 females and 45 males) and 544 self-declared non-nicotine-dependent subjects (352 females and 192 males). The Polish version of the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A) was used to assess affective temperaments (depressive, cyclothymic, hyperthymic, irritable and anxious). Results Nicotine-dependent individuals scored higher on cyclothymic, irritable <b>and</b> anxious <b>temperaments</b> than non-nicotine-dependents (no significant differences with regard to depressive <b>and</b> hyperthymic <b>temperaments).</b> Among the nicotine-dependent individuals, females scored higher on anxious temperaments than males (no differences with regard to the other affective <b>temperaments),</b> <b>and</b> among the non-nicotine-dependent individuals, females exhibited more depressive, cyclothymic <b>and</b> anxious <b>temperaments</b> than males, while males exhibited more hyperthymic temperaments than females. Conclusions The results suggest that affective, cyclothymic <b>and</b> irritable <b>temperaments</b> in both genders <b>and</b> anxious <b>temperaments</b> in females may be predictors of nicotine dependence in adults...|$|R

40|$|Adolescent <b>and</b> parent <b>temperaments</b> as {{predictors}} {{of the quality of}} parent-adolescent relations were examined. Participants were 88 seventh-grade adolescents and their mothers and fathers. All three family members provided reports of their own levels of activity and adaptability. Mothers, fathers, and adolescents also reported on acceptance, psychological control, lax discipline, and conflict in the parent-adolescent dyad. Multivariate multiple regressions with follow-up univariate tests indicated a complex set of relations between adolescent <b>and</b> parent <b>temperaments</b> <b>and</b> parent-adolescent relations. In some cases, parent <b>and</b> adolescent <b>temperaments</b> interacted to predict specific aspects of parent-adolescent relations. There were also gender-of-parent and gender-of-adolescent differences in the associations between <b>temperament</b> <b>and</b> parent-adolescent relations. These results are consistent with the goodness-of-fit model of temperament...|$|R
