5000|$|Ellen reveals two empty vodka bottles were {{discovered}} {{on the flight}} - {{despite the fact that}} no beverages were served to passengers onboard, and that Whip has also suspended in flight service prior to take off. With the exclusion of Whip's test, Ellen reveals that Katerina's toxicology report came back positive. Ellen asks Whip if he believes that Katerina had drank onboard the flight. Rather than allow Katerina's reputation to be destroyed for his own actions, Whip reluctantly, but finally admits to having drank on board the flight and in the three {{days leading up to the}} flight, and confessing he is an alcoholic. A year later, Whip, now imprisoned tells his story to a support group of his fellow inmates. Whip tells them that the FAA revoked his license for good, and that he will most likely spend the next 4 to 5 years behind bars for his actions - both consequences of which he firmly agrees are deserved and fair. Whip also relates that he is proud to be sober, and does not regret doing the right thing.

The next day (ekadashi i.e. the eleventh lunar day) evening all the devotees go around in an event called [...] "laru kurano" [...] (meaning: picking up sweet cakes called naru). This event is marked by a representative group of these households visiting houses of all the relatives and acquaintances in the village with a plastic bag.

5000|$|The debacle at Peterloo, {{caused by}} an over-reaction of the local Manchester authorities, added greatly to his prestige. Moral force was not {{sufficient}} in itself, and physical force entailed too great a risk. Although urged to do so after Peterloo, Hunt refused to give his approval to schemes for a full-scale insurrection. Thereby all momentum was lost, as more desperate souls turned to worn out cloak-and-dagger schemes, which surfaced in the Cato Street conspiracy.While in prison {{for his part in}} Peterloo, Hunt turned to writing, to putting his message across through a variety of forms, including an autobiography. After his release he attempted to recover some of his lost fortune by beginning new business ventures in London, which included the production and marketing of a roasted corn Breakfast Powder, the [...] "most salubrious and nourishing Beverage that can be substituted for the use of Tea and Coffee, which are always exciting, and frequently the most irritating to the Stomach and Bowels." [...] He also made shoe-blacking bottles, which carried the slogan [...] "Equal Laws, Equal Rights, Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and the Ballot." [...] Synthetic coal, intended specifically for the French market, was another of his schemes. After the July Revolution in 1830 he sent samples to Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette and other political heroes, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> fraternal <b>greetings.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In Serbian and Orthodox tradition, {{the number}} three is {{exceptionally}} important. Three fingers are used when signing the cross in Orthodoxy, symbolizing the Trinity. The Serbs, when swearing Oath, historically used the three fingers (collected, as when crossing) <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the <b>greetings</b> [...] "My Holy Trinity" [...] (Svetog mi Trojstva) or [...] "for the Honorable Cross and Golden Freedom" [...] (za krst časni i slobodu zlatnu) during formal and religious events. The salute was often made with both hands, raised above the head. Serbian peasants sealed a pledge by raising three {{fingers to the}} face, the face being [...] "the focus of honour" [...] in Balkan culture. A Serbian proverb goes [...] "There is no cross without three fingers" [...] (Nema krsta bez tri prsta). Karađorđe was appointed leader of the Serbian rebels after they all raised their [...] "three fingers in the air" [...] and thereby swore Oath. [...] The three fingers were viewed of {{as a symbol of}} [...] in the 19th century. Njegoš mentioned [...] "the crossing with three fingers has not remained" [...] when speaking of the Islamization of Serbs, a central theme in The Mountain Wreath (1847). Paja Jovanović's painting, The Takovo Uprising (1888), depicts Miloš Obrenović holding a war flag and saluting with three fingers. [...] The Serb-Catholic movement in Dubrovnik, which supported that Serbs had three faiths (Orthodoxy, Catholicism and Islam), criticized the Pan-Serbists who according to them only [...] "truly believed those Serbs, who cross with three fingers". A short story published in 1901 surrounds a Serbian despot meeting with a Szilágyi, who has the despot's three fingers cut off by Franciscan friars after discussing the right way of crossing. Serbian Metropolitan Nikolaj Velimirović (1881-1956) called for a Serbian salute in which three fingers were to be raised along the greeting: [...] "Thus Help Us God!". In 1937, Velimirović began a sermon protesting the Catholic support for separation of state and religion in Yugoslavia with [...] "Rise three fingers Orthodox Serbs!".|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{relationship}} between endogenous oxytocin and social affiliative behavior can be critically moderated by contextual and individual factors in humans. While oxytocin has been shown to influence human-directed affiliative behaviors in dogs, no study investigated yet how such factors moderate these effects. Our study aimed to investigate whether the context and the dogs’ individual characteristics moderate the associations between the social affiliative (greeting) behavior and four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene. We recorded the greeting behavior in three contexts: (1) when the dog first met an unfamiliar experimenter, (2) during a separation from the owner, and (3) after the experimenter approached the dog in a threatening manner. In the latter two contexts (during separation and after threatening), we categorized the dogs into stressed and non-stressed groups based on their behavior in the preceding situations. In line with previous studies, we found that polymorphisms in the OXTR gene are related to the greeting behavior of dogs. However, we also showed that the analyzed SNPs were associated <b>with</b> <b>greeting</b> in different contexts and in different individuals, suggesting that the four SNPs might be related to different functions of the oxytocin system. The - 213 A/G was associated <b>with</b> <b>greeting</b> only when the dog had no prior negative experience with the experimenter. The rs 8679682 was found in association <b>with</b> <b>greeting</b> in all three contexts but these associations were significant only in non-stressed dogs. The - 94 T/C was associated <b>with</b> <b>greeting</b> only when the dog was stressed and had an interaction with the sex of the dog. The - 74 C/G SNP was associated <b>with</b> <b>greeting</b> only when the dog was stressed during separation and also had a sex interaction. Taken together, our results suggest that, similarly to humans, the effects of oxytocin on the dogs’ social behavior are not universal, but constrained by features of situations and individuals. Understanding these constraints helps further clarify how oxytocin mediates social behavior which, in the long run, could improve the application of oxytocin in pharmacotherapy...|$|R
