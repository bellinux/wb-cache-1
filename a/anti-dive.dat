25|$|The {{development}} of the Watt's linkage rear suspension came first. This {{was followed by the}} front <b>anti-dive</b> modifications. The {{development of}} the <b>anti-dive</b> geometry was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC’s schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of <b>anti-dive</b> to the Mustang’s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.|$|E
25|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined lower wishbones for <b>anti-dive</b> effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section cross-member with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|E
25|$|For 1968, {{the team}} had {{consistently}} improved and suffered only one DNF (did not finish) from an engine problem. The race program was supporting a company that had no performance parts, no test facility, and no technical support for the program. As for the production cars, they had no <b>anti-dive</b> potential built into the uni-body; only single-barrel carburetor manifolds; and even when running properly, they didn’t make as much horsepower as the competitors. The 1968 deal provided Jeffords and Kaplan support from Carl Chakmakian, who was the primary contact on the AMC program.|$|E

50|$|UNITA {{would later}} claim {{responsibility}} when they released a communique out of Lisbon, Portugal on 2 August 1984 stating they had sunk a Soviet and Cuban ship, destroying war material. The Angolan news agency ANGOP announced a Angolan and East German ship had {{been damaged by}} saboteurs with American mines, a statement the American's quickly denied. The Angolan's and Russian's had studied the dummy mine and their investigations concluded it was too unsophisticated {{to have been the}} type that had caused the destruction and that the operation was the work of the South African special forces though the use of a submarine was not suspected. <b>Anti-diving</b> countermeasures would be introduced in the harbour as well as increased naval patrols.|$|R
2500|$|The XJ6, using 2.8-litre (...) and 4.2-litre (...) straight-six {{cylinder}} {{versions of}} Jaguar's renowned XK engine, replaced most of Jaguar's saloons – which, in the 1960s, had expanded to four separate ranges. Apart from the engines, other main assemblies carried over from previous models were the widest version of Jaguar's IRS unit from the Mark X and the subframe mounted {{independent front suspension}} first seen in the 1955 2.4-litre with new <b>anti-dive</b> geometry.|$|E
2500|$|While the SA22/FB was a purer sports car, the FC tended {{toward the}} softer sport-tourer trends of its day, sharing some {{similarities}} with the HB series Cosmo. Handling was much improved, with {{less of the}} oversteer tendencies of the FB. The rear end design was vastly improved from the FB's live rear axle to a more modern, Independent Rear Suspension (rear axle). Steering was more precise, with {{rack and pinion steering}} replacing the old recirculating ball steering of the FB. Disc brakes also became standard, with some models (S4: Sport, GXL, GTU, Turbo II, Convertible; S5: GXL, GTUs, Turbo, Convertible) offering four-piston front brakes. The rear seats were optional in some models of the FC RX-7, but are not commonly found in the American Market. Mazda also introduced Dynamic Tracking Suspension System (DTSS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The revised independent rear suspension incorporated special toe control hubs which were capable of introducing a limited degree of passive rear steering under cornering loads. The DTSS worked by allowing a slight amount of toe-out under normal driving conditions but induced slight toe-in under heavier cornering loads at around 0.5 Gs or more; toe-out in the rear allows for a more responsive rotation of the rear, but toe-in allowed for a more stable rear under heavier cornering. [...] Mazda also introduced Auto Adjusting Suspension (AAS) in the 2nd generation RX-7. The system changed damping characteristics according to the road and driving conditions. [...] The system compensated for camber changes and provided <b>anti-dive</b> and anti-squat effects.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cartridge}} forks, which allow more low speed damping and less high speed damping than the previous damping rod forks, separate <b>anti-dive</b> mechanisms have generally fallen out of use.|$|E
5000|$|Gelbke {{introduced}} several firsts to motorcycle {{design with}} Roadog, including dual headlights, automatic transmission with reverse gear, <b>anti-dive</b> leading-link [...] "Earles" [...] type front fork, hydraulic stands, and {{front and rear}} disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|The car has race-derived pushrod {{suspension}} with <b>anti-dive</b> {{geometry and}} is complemented by Multimatic’s Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars front and rear, driver-adjustable anti-lock braking, and variable traction control.|$|E
50|$|The W201 {{featured}} a patented rear 5-link suspension, subsequently used in E and C class models, {{front and rear}} anti-roll bars, <b>anti-dive</b> and anti-squat geometry—as well as available airbags, ABS brakes and seatbelt pretensioners.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, Honda {{replaced}} the CB900C with the CB1000C. The CB1000C used the dual-range transmission previously {{available on the}} CB900C. The [...] version included the TRAC <b>anti-dive</b> system also used on the 1983 CB1100F.|$|E
50|$|The FPA cars feature fully {{independent}} suspension {{based on a}} double wishbone design, with geometry which includes anti-squat and <b>anti-dive</b> pushrod operation. Ohlins two-way adjustable dampers, along with adjustable anti-roll bars complete the suspension system.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} rear {{suspension}} is of a double wishbone and pushrod operated twin coil over damper construction. Adjustable ride height, cambers and toe, as well as <b>anti-dive</b> and anti-squat made to optimise drive control.|$|E
50|$|TRAC (Torque Reactive <b>Anti-dive</b> Control): This {{was fitted}} {{to a number}} of Honda {{motorcycles}} such as the CB1100F, CB1000C, and VFR750F and worked by utilizing a pivoting caliper that activated a valve in the fork leg.|$|E
50|$|The Sabres, {{especially}} the V45, were technology showcases for Honda. Not {{only did they}} feature revolutionary water-cooled, DOHC, 90-degree-V four-cylinder engines, but they also featured hydraulically actuated, one-way clutches, TRAC <b>anti-dive</b> front suspension, Pro-link rear suspensions, and electronic speedometers and tachometers.|$|E
5000|$|The CB900F's engine has a [...] four-cylinder DOHC engine with a bore {{and stroke}} of 64.5 by 69.0 mm. The engine drew on other designs, such as the CB1000C, CB1100F/CB1100R, and the inline-6 CBX1000. The CB900F has a {{five-speed}} gearbox and chain final drive, and it produces [...] @ 9000 rpm The CB900F has two front disc brakes and one rear disk brake, all fitted with dual-piston calipers after 1983. The air-assisted fork was fitted with the Honda TRAC (torque reactive <b>anti-dive</b> control) <b>anti-dive</b> system in 1982 or 1983. The bike shares the same bodywork (tank, side covers, tailpiece) as the earlier CB750F Super Sport. There are similarities between the CB900F bodywork {{and that of the}} CB1100F and CBX.|$|E
50|$|First-generation VFR750Fs sported <b>anti-dive</b> (adjustable on some models) on the damping-rod front 37 mm Showa forks (uprated to 41mm for 1988) and a conventional, dual-sided {{aluminium}} swingarm with a {{centrally located}} Showa damping unit with remote hydraulic pre-load adjustment at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Medallion {{featured}} four-wheel {{independent suspension}} with MacPherson struts {{in the front}} with negative offset for stability and inclined lower wishbones for <b>anti-dive</b> effect, while the rear suspension is controlled by a V-section cross-member with four transverse torsion bars and inclined shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|The front {{suspension}} of the car was independent, with double wishbones operating entirely on adjustable rod-ends and a separate anti-roll bar. Springing by coil springs was enabled in conjunction with Armstrong dampers, incorporating adjustable spring platforms. The suspension has built-in <b>anti-dive</b> qualities.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{determining}} the <b>anti-dive</b> or anti-squat depends on whether the suspension linkages react to the torque of braking and accelerating. For example, with inboard brakes and half-shaft driven rear wheels, the suspension linkages do not, but with outboard brakes and a swing-axle driveline, they do.|$|E
5000|$|The Speedfight 2 was {{introduced}} in 2001 after {{the success of the}} original model. The designs of the front panel, rear panel and light are different on the two models. The Speedfight 2 is available in air-cooled and liquid-cooled variants. The model was also equipped with <b>anti-dive</b> front suspension ...|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{allows for}} a smooth ride on small wheels. The <b>anti-dive</b> suspension has minimal impact on pedalling efficiency due to its stiffness, while improving rolling resistance on rough surfaces. The suspension can be adjusted using different elastomers (small pieces of rubber that serve as suspension, but gas filled alternatives are available).|$|E
50|$|For the 1981 {{season the}} KR500 was improved, a new chassis was built which was stiffer and lighter, with {{magnesium}} crankcases and <b>anti-dive</b> front forks. The season saw the KR500 get its first podium finishes with two third places (in Netherlands and Finland) with Ballington finishing 8th {{in the final}} standings of the championship.|$|E
5000|$|Brake dive with {{telescopic}} forks can {{be reduced}} by either increasing the spring rate of the fork springs, orincreasing the compression damping of the forks. However, all of these changes make the motorcycle less pleasant to ride on rough roads, since the front end will feel stiffer, in the 1980s various manufacturers attempted to get round this by methods of <b>anti-dive</b> such as: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1983 a new GPz1100 {{design was}} {{released}} that featured Unitrack single suspension, <b>anti-dive</b> units on the forks {{and a major}} styling overhaul often called the [...] "swish" [...] look. Known as the ZX1100A1 model, the 1983 model featured a larger fairing (with a lower fairing section as an option to give a full race fairing), different instrumentation and a warning panel mounted on the redesigned petrol tank. This model contained many features that were {{to appear on the}} GPz900R model leading to the suspicion that it was used to test the acceptability of newer technology such as Unitrack and <b>Anti-Dive</b> forks and the newer styling. The 1983 model featured the same EFI design with a few small modifications, such as the inclusion of a warning light that flashed service codes when the DFI system was having a problem, a rev-limiter, and a 'limp' mode that would allow the engine to keep running if one of the sensors failed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anti-dive</b> and {{anti-squat}} are percentages {{that indicate}} {{the degree to}} which the front dives under braking and the rear squats under acceleration. They can be thought of as the counterparts for braking and acceleration, as jacking forces are to cornering. The main reason for the difference is due to the different design goals between front and rear suspension, whereas suspension is usually symmetrical between the left and right of the vehicle.|$|E
