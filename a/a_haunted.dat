In 2009, it was transformed into Happy Jack's Toy Factory, <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> toy factory.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E

Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons.

5|$|The {{game was}} a major {{inspiration}} for the critically acclaimed CITV game show Knightmare, with producer Tim Child realising that if a ZX Spectrum could run a compelling adventure game, then a television programme with pre-rendered graphics could revolutionise the genre. Sabre Wulf, which was released for the ZX Spectrum by Ultimate Play the Game later in 1984, was noted for having similar gameplay to Atic Atac, including its similar themes of a continuous maze. In a retrospective interview with Retro Gamer, Rare designer Greg Mayles asserted that their 2003 game Grabbed by the Ghoulies was not inspired by Atic Atac, despite their similar themes of <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> mansion.|$|E

While working as a medical intern in the facility, the lead character Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) encounters various spirits and discovers that the doctors are running unethical experiments on their patients. The executive producers included Aaron Spelling, E. Duke Vincent, and Mark Frost. Media outlets found the partnership between Spelling and Frost surprising given their differing styles and approaches to television.|$|E
5|$|Over {{a four-month}} period, Berkley Books {{published}} three young adult novels written by Kelly O'Rourke; the novels are original stories created by O'Rourke, with no direct continuity with the films. The first, released on October 1, 1997, titled The Scream Factory, follows {{a group of}} friends who set up <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> house attraction in the basement of Haddonfield City Hall, only to be stalked and killed by Michael Myers while they are there. The Old Myers Place is the second novel, released December 1, 1997, and focuses on Mary White, who moves into the Myers house with her family.

5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an L-shaped corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent {{back to the beginning of}} the current loop.|$|E
5|$|Nuka-World {{itself is}} divided into six smaller parts, each {{of which can be}} {{explored}} by the player: Nuka-Town, U.S.A., the park's central hub, made up of restaurants, souvenir stores, and sideshows; Kiddie Kingdom, a fantasy setting, featuring a central castle, fairground rides, and a candy theme throughout, has been overrun by ghouls; Dry Rock Gulch, a wild west-themed area, featuring roller coasters and animatronic gunslingers which has been infested with a parasitic larvae known as Bloodworms; Safari Adventure, a wildlife enclosure filled with exotic animals that have since turned wild; the Galactic Zone, a space-themed park populated by customized robots that have malfunctioned and reverted to their military specifications long before; and the Nuka-Cola bottling plant, a model Nuka-Cola factory offering guided tours and samples of Nuka-Cola products that have since leached into the environment and triggered additional mutations in the local fauna. The area surrounding Nuka-World includes: Bradberton, a town built to house park employees, the defunct Nuka-World power plant, Grandchester, <b>a</b> <b>haunted</b> mansion and tourist attraction, and the Nuka-World scrapyard containing a UFO-themed carnival ride which the Hubologists are convinced is a genuine spaceship.|$|E
