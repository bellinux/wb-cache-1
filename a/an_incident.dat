40|$|<b>A</b> traffic <b>incident</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources for {{degrading}} network capacity, inducing traffic congestion, and decreasing network reliability. The impacts of <b>a</b> traffic <b>incident</b> on network reliability have been extensively studied with the use of static network equilibrium or dynamic simulation models. In this paper, an analytical reliability-based dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model is proposed for assessing the temporal and spatial impacts of <b>a</b> traffic <b>incident</b> on network reliability. The proposed DTA model can be used to estimate the stochastic link flow pattern and route travel time distribution for examining the impacts of <b>a</b> traffic <b>incident</b> on the on-time arrival probability with and without dynamic speed limit (SL) control. It is shown that <b>a</b> traffic <b>incident</b> on <b>a</b> congested road during peak period will greatly decrease the on-time arrival probability, particularly when the incident has greater effects on link capacity degradation with longer duration. Under certain circumstances, SL control can be employed to reduce total network delay during the time intervals with <b>a</b> traffic <b>incident.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors render {{the results of}} {{research}} investigating adult attachment and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) {{in a sample of}} Belgian security workers. The sample contained 3 subsamples: 68 individuals who had directly experienced <b>a</b> critical <b>incident,</b> 67 individuals who indirectly went through <b>a</b> critical <b>incident,</b> and 77 individuals who had not experienced <b>a</b> critical <b>incident</b> in the last six months. The analysis of the research results shows that the secure attachment style and the three PTSD trauma symptom clusters in DSM-IV - intrusion, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal - discriminate between the three subsamples. In other words, security workers who were directly and actively confronted with <b>a</b> critical <b>incident</b> were significantly more insecurely attached and suffered significantly more from PTSD symptoms than the groups who had no or indirect experience of <b>a</b> critical <b>incident.</b> Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy is widely and quite efficiently used in the treatment of PTSD.
