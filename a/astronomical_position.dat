50|$|In April 1831, Dunlop was {{appointed}} {{superintendent of the}} Government observatory at Parramatta. He was selected mainly from his good knowledge of Colony and the observatory site, but {{the real reason for}} his selection was more because even though such an <b>astronomical</b> <b>position</b> was formally advertised, nobody applied for the astronomical tenure. Here he was to succeed Rümker with the reasonable good salary of £300 a year. He arrived at Sydney on 6 November 1831 and found the observatory in a deplorable condition; rain had entered the building, roofing plaster had fallen down, and many important records were destroyed. Dunlop succeeded in getting the building repaired and started on his work with energy, but around 1835 his health began to fail; he had no assistant, and the building, having been attacked by white ants, fell gradually into decay. In August 1847, he resigned his position, and went to live on his farm on Brisbane Waters, an arm of Broken Bay. He died on 22 September 1848. In 1816 Dunlop married his cousin Jean Service, who survived him. In addition to the medal of the Royal Astronomical Society Dunlop was awarded medals for his work by the King of Denmark in 1833, and the Institut Royal de France in 1835.

40|$|The Space {{multi-band}} Variable Object Monitor (SVOM) is {{a proposed}} Chinese astronomical satellite, {{dedicated to the}} detection, localization and measurement of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) on the cosmological scale. An efficient algorithm is developed {{for the purpose of}} onboard star extraction from the CCD images obtained with the Visible Telescope (VT) on board SVOM. The CCD pixel coordinates of the reference stars will be used to refine the <b>astronomical</b> <b>position</b> of the satellite, which will facilitate trigger rapid ground-based follow-up obsevations of the GRBs. In this algorithm, the image is divided into a number of grid cells and the "global" pixel-value maximum within each cell is taken as the first-guess position of a "bright" star. The correct center postion of a star is then computed using a simple iterative method. Applying two additional strategies, i. e., scanning the image only by even (or odd) lines or in a black-white chess board mode, are proposed to further reduce the time to extract the stars. To examine the efficiency of the above aglorithms, we applied them to the experimental images obtained with a ground-based telescope. We find that the accuracy of the astronomical positioning achieved by our method is comparable to that derived by using the conventional star-extraction method, while the former needs CPU time about 25 times less than the latter. This will significantly improve the performance of the SVOM VT mission. Comment: 5 pages, PDF only, accepted for publication in Science in China Series...|$|E
40|$|As the 50 th {{anniversary of}} the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) draws near, the author was {{surprised}} to learn that the published latitude and longitude for CTIO in the Astronomical Almanac and iraf observatory database appears to differ from modern GPS-measured geodetic positions by nearly a kilometer. Surely, the position for CTIO could not be in error after five decades? The source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~ 30 " difference between the astronomical and geodetic positions [...] a systematic effect due to vertical deflection first reported by Harrington, Mintz Blanco, & Blanco (1972). Since the <b>astronomical</b> <b>position</b> is not necessarily the desired quantity for some calculations, and since the number of facilities on Cerro Tololo and neighboring Cerro Pachon has grown considerably over the years, I decided to measure accurate geodetic positions for all of the observatories and some select landmarks on the two peaks using GPS and Google Earth. Both sets of measurements were inter-compared, and externally compared to a high accuracy geodetic position for a NASA Space Geodesy Program survey monument on Tololo. I conclude that Google Earth can currently be used to determine absolute geodetic positions (i. e. compared to GPS) accurate to roughly +- 0. 15 " (+- 5 m) in latitude and longitude without correction, or approximately +- 0 ". 10 (+- 3 m) with correction. I tabulate final geodetic and geocentric positions on the WGS- 84 coordinate system for all astronomical observatories on Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon with accuracy +- 0 ". 1 (+- 3 m).

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the design and}} simulations of a dual-axis solar tracker. This solar tracker works solely based on the output power of the PV panel mounted to it. It does not use any photosensors to orient the PV module. Describing the process in short, {{the position of the}} Sun is first calculated based on time and location information. Since this solar panel will be mounted here at UiT, Norges Arktiske Universitet, Narvik. So, it’s latitude and longitude is always fixed. Theoretically, PV panel should be placed such that it’s face is perpendicular to the Sun. But the optimal position for the PV module may be slightly different from the <b>astronomical</b> <b>position</b> (facing perpendicular to the Sun) due the reflection of snow and other factors. So to track for the optimal position, the panel is moved in the tilt direction first. And the tilt angle is increased slightly by a certain step size and the output power is compared in each tilt angles. The tilt angle that gives maximum power is set as optimal tilt angle. The PV panel is then kept at this optimal tilt angle and then the same process is repeated to find the optimal azimuth angle. For the movement of the PV panel a slewing drive has been selected by other student groups. The other half of this report deals with the control of the dc motors used in the slewing drive. The rotation of the dc motors are observed and controlled so that the PV module always faces the correct direction that is required during the tracking process. Strong wind can cause mechanical damage to the PV module. Therefore, when strong wind over the danger limit is detected, the PV panels is kept parallel to the ground to minimize the surface area that comes in contact with the strong wind. When the system starts for the first time or after a power failure then It should first put itself to the 90 ̊ tilt and 0 ̊ azimuth position. In short, this report details the complete control system for dual-axis solar tracker and the protection from strong Wind...|$|E
