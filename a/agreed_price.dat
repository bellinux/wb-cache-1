5|$|Brassey had {{considerable}} skill in choosing good men {{to work in}} this way and in delegating the work. Having taken on a contract at an <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> {{he would make a}} suitable sum of money available to the agent to meet the costs. If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|WMATA's {{bus system}} is a {{successor}} to four privately owned bus companies. While WMATA's original compact provided only for rail service, by 1970 the need for reliable bus services to connect passengers to rail stations led to calls for authority to overhaul the entire bus system as well. The compact was amended in 1971, allowing the authority to operate buses and take over bus companies. After months of negotiation with Chalk failed to produce an <b>agreed</b> <b>price,</b> on January 14, 1973, WMATA condemned DC Transit and its sister company, the Washington, Virginia and Maryland Coach Company and acquired their assets for $38.2 million. On February 4, it acquired Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company, which operated in Northern Virginia, and the WMA Transit Company of Prince George's County for $4.5 million. While AB and WMA Transit were in better financial condition than DC Transit, their owners {{did not wish to}} compete with a publicly owned bus system, and requested takeover.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, {{it seems}} Doucet paid 30,000 francs {{rather than the}} <b>agreed</b> <b>price.</b> A {{few months after the}} {{purchase}} Doucet had the painting appraised at between 250,000 and 300,000 francs. Richardson speculates that Picasso, who by 1924 was {{on the top of the}} art world and didn't need to sell the painting to Doucet, did so and at that low price because Doucet promised Les Demoiselles would go to the Louvre in his will. However, after Doucet died in 1929 he did not leave the painting to the Louvre in his will, and it was sold like most of Doucet's collection through private dealers.|$|E
25|$|By 1978, {{another factor}} began to {{influence}} the debate. The school, now over 600 strong with a regular 3 form entry into the senior department was desperately cramped and any additional building could only now {{take place at the}} expense of playing field space. In late 1978 {{it became clear that the}} whole of the convent site was available and an offer to buy would be accepted subject to surveys and discussion of associated issues. The contract was signed in March 1979 at an <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> of £250,000 although it was immediately obvious that a considerable amount of repair and remedial work would be necessary over the next years. The acquisition of the convent buildings meant that, in theory at least, the immediate overcrowding problem was averted but there was still the issue of cost and fees.|$|E
25|$|On January 4, Russia and Ukraine {{ended the}} dispute. A five-year {{contract}} was signed, although with prices set {{for six months}} only. According to the contract, the gas was sold not directly to Naftogaz, but to RosUkrEnergo, who paid $230 per 1,000cubic metres. After mixing it with two thirds of cheaper supplies from Central Asia RosUkrEnergo resold it to Ukraine at a price of $95 per 1,000cubic metres. The parties also agreed to raise the transit tariff from US$1.09 to US$1.60 per 1,000cubic meters per 100km. This price also held for transit of Turkmen gas through Russia to Ukraine. The <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> would fluctuate with the market, according to a Gazprom spokesman.

25|$|During construction, {{questions}} were publicly {{raised about the}} stability of the building's foundations in light of the water table on the site and the presence of a subterranean stream. Liebe conferred with the architect and engineers before developing a revised design which featured drains to divert running water. Liebe presented the modified plans to Molloy and proceeded with them, assuming that he had the consent of Molloy. Construction progressed, and the building was completed on schedule. When the time finally came for Molloy to pay Liebe for the construction, a dispute arose as to who should be liable for the extra £17,000 incurred in remedying the structural defect. Molloy was reputed {{to be one of the}} most litigious businessmen in Perth, and refused to pay higher than the original <b>agreed</b> <b>price,</b> on the basis that the contract required his written approval for extra work to be carried out. Liebe pursued him through the courts all the way to the High Court and Privy Council. The Privy Council eventually ruled in favour of Liebe, however the legal costs he had incurred were exorbitant.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was pleased}} to learn of Rudd's success. The High Commissioner wanted to gazette the {{concession}} immediately, but Rhodes knew that the promise to arm Lobengula with 1,000 Martini–Henrys would be received with apprehension elsewhere in South Africa, especially among Boers; he suggested that {{this aspect of the}} concession should be kept quiet until the guns were already in Bechuanaland. Rudd therefore prepared a version of the document omitting mention of the Martini–Henrys, which was approved by Rhodes and Robinson, and published in the Cape Times and Cape Argus newspapers on 24 November 1888. The altered version described the <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> for the Zambezi–Limpopo mining monopoly as [...] "the valuable consideration of a large monthly payment in cash, a gunboat for defensive purposes on the Zambesi, and other services." [...] Two days later, the Cape Times printed a notice from Lobengula: ...|$|E
500|$|When Hammam {{purchased}} the club from Noades in 1981, Wimbledon also owned {{the ground at}} Plough Lane; a pre-emption clause existed, however, which reserved the site for [...] "sports, leisure or recreational purposes" [...] only. If Wimbledon Football Club were ever wound up, Plough Lane's owners were legally bound to sell the stadium to Merton Council for £8,000, irrespective of inflation. This clause reduced {{the possibility of the}} club losing its home stadium, but it was unpopular with a succession of Wimbledon owners as it made the site practically worthless as real estate. Hammam complained that this limited his ability to borrow money needed to redevelop the ground. Seeking to increase Plough Lane's commercial value, Hammam entered into negotiations with the council to remove the clause in 1990; the eventual <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> for the revoking of the clause was a sum between £300,000 and £800,000. At least one Wimbledon club director resigned his position in protest.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} contract, {{there are a}} number of risks {{associated}} with contract farming. Common problems include farmers selling to a buyer other than the one with whom they hold a contract (known as side selling, extra-contractual marketing or, in the Philippines, “pole vaulting”), or using inputs supplied by the company for purposes other than intended. From the other side, a company sometimes fails to buy products at the <b>agreed</b> <b>prices</b> or in the agreed quantities, or arbitrarily downgrades produce quality.|$|R

Kjevik was passed in the council on 30 September 1937 with 34 against 26 votes. Construction commenced in November and was contracted to Høyer-Ellefsen. The same year the Norwegian Army Air Service used the fields at Kjevik for training.|$|R
500|$|... f. [...] According to archival {{research}} in the late 1990s, El Greco was still in Candia {{at the age of}} twenty-six. It was there where his works, created {{in the spirit of the}} post-Byzantine painters of the Cretan School, were greatly esteemed. On 26 December 1566 El Greco sought permission from the Venetian authorities to sell a [...] "panel of the Passion of Christ executed on a gold background" [...] ("un quadro della Passione del Nostro Signor Giesu Christo, dorato") in a lottery. The Byzantine icon by young Doménicos depicting the Passion of Christ, painted on a gold ground, was appraised and sold on 27 December 1566 in Candia for the <b>agreed</b> <b>price</b> of seventy gold ducats (The panel was valued by two artists; one of them was icon-painter Georgios Klontzas. One valuation was eighty ducats and the other seventy), equal in value to a work by Titian or Tintoretto of that period. Therefore, it seems that El Greco traveled to Venice sometime after 27 December 1566. In one of his last articles, Wethey reassessed his previous estimations and accepted that El Greco left Crete in 1567. According to other archival material—drawings El Greco sent to a Cretan cartographer—he was in Venice by 1568.|$|E
