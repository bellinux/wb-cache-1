25|$|There are {{currently}} 20 mutations in CACNA1H associated with CAE. These mutations are likely not wholly causative and should instead {{be thought of}} as giving susceptibility. This is particularly true since some groups have found no connection between CAE and CACNA1H mutations. Many of the CACNA1H mutations have a measurable effect on channel kinetics, including <b>activation</b> <b>time</b> constant and voltage dependence, deactivation time constant, and inactivation time constant and voltage dependence (summarized in Table 1). Many of these mutations should lead to neuronal excitability, though others may lead to hypoexcitability. These predictions are due to mathematical modeling and may differ from what will occur in real neurons where other proteins, some of which may interact with CACNA1H, are present.|$|E
25|$|Type 1 episodic ataxia (EA1) is {{characterized}} by attacks of generalized ataxia induced by emotion or stress, with myokymia both during and between attacks. This disorder {{is also known as}} episodic ataxia with myokymia (EAM), hereditary paroxysmal ataxia with neuromyotonia and Isaacs-Mertens syndrome. Onset of EA1 occurs during early childhood to adolescence and persists throughout the patient's life. Attacks last from seconds to minutes. Mutations of the gene KCNA1, which encodes the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.1, are responsible for this subtype of episodic ataxia. KV1.1 is expressed heavily in basket cells and interneurons that form GABAergic synapses on Purkinje cells. The channels aid in the repolarization phase of action potentials, thus affecting inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thereby, all motor output from the cerebellum. EA1 {{is an example of a}} synaptopathy. There are currently 17 KV1.1 mutations associated with EA1, Table 1 and Figure 1. 15 of these mutations have been at least partly characterized in cell culture based electrophysiological assays wherein 14 of these 15 mutations have demonstrated drastic alterations in channel function. As described in Table 1, most of the known EA1 associated mutations result in a drastic decrease in the amount of current through KV1.1 channels. Furthermore, these channels tend to activate at more positive potentials and slower rates, demonstrated by positive shifts in their V½ values and slower τ <b>activation</b> <b>time</b> constants, respectively. Some of these mutations, moreover, produce channels that deactivate at faster rates (deactivation τ), which would also result in decreased current through these channels. While these biophysical changes in channel properties likely underlie some of the decrease in current observed in experiments, many mutations also seem to result in misfolded or otherwise mistrafficked channels, which is likely to be the major cause of dysfunction and disease pathogenesis. It is assumed, though not yet proven, that decrease in KV1.1 mediated current leads to prolonged action potentials in interneurons and basket cells. As these cells are important in the regulation of Purkinje cell activity, it is likely that this results increased and aberrant inhibitory input into Purkinje cells and, thus, disrupted Purkinje cell firing and cerebellum output.|$|E

During the experiments various results were recorded, including temperatures, optical densities and smoke detector <b>activation</b> <b>times.</b> The fire scenarios where modelled using FDS, Version 5.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} cardiac electrical activation dynamics after cardiac resynchronization therapy. Although this procedure reduces {{morbidity and mortality}} in heart failure patients, many approaches attempting to identify the responders have shown that 30 % of patients do not attain clinical or functional improvement. This study sought to quantify and characterize the effect of resynchronization therapy on the ventricular electrical activation of patients using body surface potential mapping, a noninvasive tool. METHODS: This retrospective study included 91 resynchronization patients {{with a mean age}} of 61 years, left ventricle ejection fraction of 28 %, mean QRS duration of 182 ms, and functional class III/IV (78 %/ 22 %); the patients underwent 87 -lead body surface mapping with the resynchronization device on and off. Thirty-six patients were excluded. Body surface isochronal maps produced 87 maximal/mean global ventricular <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> with three regions identified. The regional <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> for right and left ventricles and their inter-regional right-to-left ventricle gradients were calculated from these results and analyzed. The Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskall-Wallis test were used for comparisons, with the level of significance set at p&# 8804; 0. 05. RESULTS: During intrinsic rhythms, regional ventricular <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> were significantly different (54. 5 ms vs. 95. 9 ms in the right and left ventricle regions, respectively). Regarding cardiac resynchronization, the maximal global value was significantly reduced (138 ms to 131 ms), and a downward variation of 19. 4 % in regional-left and an upward variation of 44. 8 % in regional-right ventricular <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> resulted in a significantly reduced inter-regional gradient (43. 8 ms to 17 ms). CONCLUSIONS: Body surface potential mapping in resynchronization patients yielded electrical ventricular <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> for two cardiac regions with significantly decreased global and regional-left values but significantly increased regional-right values, thus showing an attenuated inter-regional gradient after the cardiac resynchronization therapy...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{reproducibility}} of {{the measurement}} of local epicardial <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> using in-traoperative epicardial mapping was studied in 10 patients. Two multipolar electrodes were used, one as a reference located on the anterior surface of the right ventricle, the other as a hand-held probe for depicting local <b>activation</b> <b>times.</b> During atrial pacing at 100 beats/min, <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> at various sites of the heart were measured consecutively using a grid system that defined 75 points {{on the surface of}} the heart. The surface of the heart was divided into three areas: the anterior wall of the right ventricle, the left lateral wall and the posterior wall of both ventricles. The measurements were repeated twice at the same paced atrial rate. From these data the mean absolute differences between the first and second measurements were calculated for each point. The earliest onset of excitation was depicted {{on the surface of the}} anterior wall of the right ventricle. The mean difference between the first and second measurement at identical paced rates was 8 msec on the anterior wall, 6 msec on the left lateral wall, and 7 msec on the posterior wall. At individual points, the differences were much greater (40 msec maximum). These greater differences were mainly found in the area of epicardial fat tissue in the atrioventricular groove or the sulcus interventricularis. Using a visual coordinate system, it is possible to achieve a good reproducibility of local <b>activation</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{interpret}} biological motion trajectories {{as being}} com-posed of sequences of sub-blocks or motion primitives. Such primitives, {{together with the}} information, when they occur during an observed tra-jectory, provide a compact representation of movement in terms of events that is invariant to temporal shifts. Based on this representation, we present {{a model for the}} generation of motion trajectories that consists of two layers. In the lower layer, a trajectory is generated by activat-ing a number of motion primitives from a learned dictionary, according to a given set of <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> and amplitudes. In the upper layer, the process generating the <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> is modeled by a group of Integrate-and-Fire neurons that emits spikes, dependent on a given class of trajectories, that activate the motion primitives in the lower layer.

40|$|Dispersion in repolarization is {{important}} for the genesis of the T wave, and for the induction of reentrant arrhtyhmias. Because the T wave differs across species our intent here is to review the epicardial, endocardial and transmural repolarization patterns contributing to repolarization in whole hearts from man, dog and pig. The major points we emphasize are: transmural repolarization time gradients are small and are directed from endocardium (early) to epicardium (late) in dog and human and from epicardium to endocardium in pig; the right ventricle tends to repolarize before the left ventricle and this difference is larger in dog than in pig; a negative relation between the <b>activation</b> <b>times</b> and the repolarization times is rare in man, and absent in dog and pig. Given the above, a large dispersion in repolarization between two myocardial areas does not lead to arrhythmias without a premature beat.
