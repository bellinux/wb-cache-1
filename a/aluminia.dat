50|$|Peraluminous {{rocks are}} igneous rocks {{that have a}} {{molecular}} proportion of aluminium oxide higher than the combination of sodium oxide, potassium oxide and calcium oxide. This contrasts with peralkaline in which the alkalis are higher, metaluminous where aluminium oxide concentration {{is lower than the}} combination, but above the alkalis, and subaluminous in which <b>aluminia</b> concentration is lower than the combination. Examples of peraluminous minerals include biotite, muscovite, cordierite, andalusite and garnet.|$|E

50|$|The first naphtha launch {{appears to}} have been British, {{reported}} in the French journal La Nature in 1888. This launch, Zephyr, was the invention of Alfred Yarrow, a well-known builder of steam launches for some years previously. Similar launches were produced in the same year by the Swiss company Escher Wyss AG. One of these was Alfred Nobel's graceful aluminium-hulled sloop Mignon, of 1892. Another, also of aluminium, was the <b>Aluminia</b> of 1894.|$|E
50|$|The inssurance company Hafnia {{acquired}} {{the building in}} 1872 and made it their headquarters.

50|$|The -ium suffix {{followed}} the precedent set in other newly discovered {{elements of the}} time: potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and strontium (all of which Davy isolated himself). Nevertheless, element names ending in -um were not unknown at the time; for example, platinum (known to Europeans since the 16th century), molybdenum (discovered in 1778), and tantalum (discovered in 1802). The -um suffix {{is consistent with the}} universal spelling alumina for the oxide (as opposed to <b>aluminia),</b> as lanthana is the oxide of lanthanum, and magnesia, ceria, and thoria are the oxides of magnesium, cerium, and thorium respectively.|$|E
50|$|Born in Ribe, in 1902 Noack went to Copenhagen {{where she}} earned a living {{painting}} porcelain at the <b>Aluminia</b> faience factory. She then attended Vallekilde Folk High School, specializing in sculpture and qualifying as an apprentice in 1910. She continued her studies there under Ivar Bentsen who exerted a considerable influence on her, together with other artists, especially Joakim Skovgaard, from the folk high school environment. In collaboration with Skovgaard, she helped to decorate the ceiling of Viborg Cathedral (1948) working as a wood carver. There she also met Niels Larsen Stevns and Arne Lofthus, both of whom encouraged her to work independently as a sculptor.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis work {{investigated}} the size reduction process of calcined black talc using a high energy CJXXM planetary mill. The grinding effects {{of two different}} grinding media, <b>aluminia</b> and zirconia, and three kinds of grinding aids, ethanol triethanolamine and sodium hexametaphosphate on the average particle size D 50 was compared. The specific surface area, morphology and crystal structure of the ground calcined black talc was characterized by BET, SEM and XRD. The kinetic models of the - 1 μm particles in the product are also been studied. The result shows that the zirconia is superior to <b>aluminia</b> as grinding media, and ethanol is a better grinding aid for calcined black talc compared with triethanolamine and sodium hexametaphosphate. The D 50 of product can be 1. 09 μm within 15 min. No agglomerations between fine particles are formed in the product. The (220) is the most unstable crystal plane.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{chemically}} induced dissolution of oxide ceramics and of modulation of near surface forces within the tribo-contact were studied. Friction and wear behavior of <b>aluminia</b> ceramics was investigated by using reciprocating sliding test in different chemical environments. The Sliding tests were conducted in different water-based liquids or in aqueous slurries containing particles with controlled surface charge. The coefficient of friction was constantly recorded during the tests and the wear loss and wear factors were subsequently determined for all samples. The worn surface were characterized by employing profilometric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and EDS. The results show significant effect of chemical agents on the coefficient of friction, {{as well as on}} the material removal rate in different aqueous media and will be discussed in terms of chemical and electrochemical properties of the materials in the tribo-contact...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} noble metal catalysts were studied for activity in the preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen-rich streams. The prepared catalysts had an active phase of platinum, palladium, iridium, ruthenium or rhodium impregnated either directly on an <b>aluminia</b> matrix or mounted on nickel or cobalt oxide. The catalysts were studied for activity, {{but also for the}} reversed water gas shift side reaction. The most active catalyst was platinum mounted on cobalt oxide and it was studied closely. The platinum on the cobalt oxide was studied using STEM with XEDS and the effects of the platinum cluster size were investigated. Via microscopy it was possible to show that platinum had no preference for either alumina or cobalt. The activity increased with increasing platinum cluster size but the selectivity passed through a maximum, a probable deactivation mechanism to the catalyst on stream, showed on a 1, 000 h deactivated sample...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of spinnable sols {{has been developed}} to obtain {{a new type of}} sol-gel derived pure <b>aluminia</b> fiber. The starting material was aluminium sec-butoxide, which was modified in a first step with glycolether, e. g., isopropoxyethanol. This leads to apartial replacement of alkoxy groups via alcoholysis an a change of the precursor structure from a trimetric to a terametric one. In the second step, carboxylation, the transformation to six-coordinated aluminium could be observed. Due to the formation of a sol with Newtonian flow behaviour after hydrolysis, gel fibers up to several kilometers long could be drawn directly from the clear colorless sol with spinning velocities up to 200 m/min. The addition of an organic filament-forming polymer is not necessary. The sol is spinnable for periods up to one year. The transformation of gel fiber to a-Al 2 O 3 occurs at 1150 deg C...|$|E
