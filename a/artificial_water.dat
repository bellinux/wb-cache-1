5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or seepage erosion.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests a spread of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{balneotherapy}} on gynecological chronic inflammations were examined both clinically and experimentally. Clinical study. Statistical observations {{were made on}} the patients with gynecological diseases who visited the spa of Misasa. It was ascertained that, among them, the patients with gynecological chronic inflammati on whose chief complains were hypogastric and Lumbar pains were most common and that, by balneotherapy, their conditions were frequently improved both subjectively and objectively. Experimental study. An experimental foreign body inflammation was evoked by inserting a Sponge into the abdominal cavity of an adult female rat {{and the effects of}} hot-spring bath were examined. Acceleration of the absorption of the inflammation, enhancement of phagocytosis of the subcutaneous histiocytes, activation of the fibrohistiocytic system of the subcutaneous connective tissue, and acceleration of return of the free cells in the abdominal cavity were proved. Furthermore, comparative studies were made on the effects of various <b>artificial</b> mineral <b>waters</b> and ultra short waves. It was found that, though they were less effective than natural mineral <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> strong saline <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> sulfur <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> sulfate <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> iron <b>water</b> and ultra short waves were effective and that <b>artificial</b> weak saline <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> bicarbonate <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> humimic acid <b>water,</b> <b>artificial</b> alkaline <b>water,</b> and <b>artificial</b> acidic <b>water</b> were as effective as fresh water. Compared with hot bath, insensible bath was more effective. No significant difference of therapeutic effect was found by bathing once a day or three times a day. In short, balneotherapy had a facilitatory action on the absorption of the inflammatory changes in the abdominal cavity. This should be ascribed not only to the increase in the deep blood flow by warming but also to the general defence mechanism enhanced by cutaneous stimulation. Some differences were also assumed depending on the ions contained in the mineral waters...|$|R
40|$|The {{density of}} {{kangaroos}} (Macropus spp.) within 5 km {{of current and}} former <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points in Sturt National Park (NSW) was studied {{over a two-year period}} using the line transect method. Kangaroo densities were not significantly related to water proximity and did not significantly differ between open and closed watering points. Infrared sensors detected and counted kangaroo movements to and from <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points and these were positively correlated with temperature. However, line transect counts did not reveal a shift in kangaroo distributions to water-proximate areas in warmer seasons. The results suggest that kangaroos travel to drink and then return to relatively stable home ranges that take advantage of sites offering the best grazing and resting opportunities. Vegetation surveys, using a wheel point device, revealed that the biomass of Atriplex spp. decreased significantly with increased proximity to <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points, but the biomass of Poaceae spp. and numerous forbs did not. Vegetative diversity was unrelated to water proximity. Low vegetation biomass near <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points in Sturt National Park may be more correctly attributed to the effects from past sheep-grazing pressure, than to any current grazing pressure. The implications of <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> point closure on conservation values and nature-based tourism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} African {{elephant}} (Loxodonta africana) induced damage on shrub and mature Baikiaea plurijuga trees was investigated around <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>watering</b> points in northern Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Damage was assessed in three zones of elephant occupancy {{during the dry}} season i. e. high elephant occupancy zone (= 1 km from water points), moderate elephant occupancy zone (> 1 – 2 km from water points) and low elephant occupancy zone (> 2 km from water points). A total of 48 plots along baseline transects were sampled among four <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points and four natural watering points at increasing distance from the watering points. Damage to recruits, mature B. plurijuga and overall woody vegetation decreased with distance from <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points. In addition, damage to mature B. plurijuga and overall woody vegetation decreased with distance from natural watering points, whereas damage to recruits did not change with distance from water points. Our results show that <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points are associated with higher damage to B. plurijuga recruits and overall woody vegetation within = 1 km radius from water points compared to natural watering points. Other changes associated with increasing distance from <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points were increase in canopy cover and decrease in woody species diversity. In the natural watering points, we recorded an increase in canopy cover, mean basal area of B. plurijuga shrubs and height B. plurijuga shrubs, and a decrease in species diversity with distance from watering points. Overall, woody species diversity was higher around natural watering points than around <b>artificial</b> <b>watering</b> points. Our findings suggest that browsing by large herbivores near watering points leads to the degradation of vegetation...|$|R

500|$|Dengue {{virus is}} {{primarily}} transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly A. aegypti. These mosquitoes usually live between the latitudes of 35°North and 35°South below {{an elevation of}} [...] They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening, but they may bite and thus spread infection {{at any time of}} day. [...] Other Aedes species that transmit the disease include A. albopictus, A. polynesiensis and A. scutellaris. Humans are the primary host of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman primates. An infection can be acquired via a single bite. A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's salivary glands and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. Aedes aegypti is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in <b>artificial</b> <b>water</b> containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates.|$|E

If he was an advertising quack, he was one who believed in his own wares. The sense of something tiny and flying was accentuated as they swept up long white curves of road in the dead but open daylight of evening. Soon the white curves came sharper and dizzier; they were upon ascending spirals, {{as they say in}} the modern religions. For, indeed, they were cresting a corner of London which is almost as precipitous as Edinburgh, if not quite so picturesque. Terrace rose above terrace, and the special tower of flats they sought, rose above them all to almost Egyptian height, gilt by the level sunset. The change, as they turned the corner and entered the crescent known as Himylaya Mansions, was as abrupt as the opening of a window; for they found that pile of flats sitting above London as above a green sea of slate. Opposite to the mansions, on the other side of the gravel crescent, was a bushy enclosure more like a steep hedge or dyke than a garden, and some way below that ran a strip of <b>artificial</b> <b>water,</b> a sort of canal, like the moat of that embowered fortress.

Assessments of non-woody plants and soils were conducted in plots laid at 50 m interval along 2 500 m long transects. Results indicated that woody species height and basal area increased with increasing distance from watering points.
