25|$|LW4 is a para-Alpine and para-Nordic {{standing}} skiing sport class {{defined by}} the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for skiers who may have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee <b>arthrodesis</b> or a hip <b>arthrodesis.</b> For international skiing competitions, classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing or IPC Nordic Skiing. A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions.|$|E
25|$|After <b>arthrodesis,</b> all rachis {{ranges of}} motion {{decrease}} because of surgery but hips extension {{range of motion}} {{is comparable to the}} one of non-operated scoliotic people.|$|E
25|$|This {{classification}} {{is used in}} para-Alpine and para-Nordic standing skiing, where LW {{stands for}} Locomotor Winter. Skiers in this class have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee <b>arthrodesis</b> or a hip <b>arthrodesis.</b> If there are functional problems on the leg, the strength of the leg will be 30 or less, where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40. Lower limb monoplegia is a type disability that is comparable to knee amputation for this class. Skiers may be in this class {{as a result of an}} amputation, or polio.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of thoracolumbar/lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, whether performed with anterior spinal fusion or posterior spinal fusion <b>arthrodesis,</b> results in overall positive changes {{that lead to}} partial normalization of some gait parameters. After surgery, a slight reduction of trunk rotation, a decrease in shoulder rotation, an increase in frontal motion of pelvic and hips (pelvic tilt and hip abduction) are observed and no changes occurred in lower extremities during gait (knee and ankle).|$|E
25|$|LW2 is a para-Alpine and para-Nordic {{standing}} ski sport class {{defined by}} the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). Competitors in this class have severe disability in a lower limb, which may {{be a result of}} an amputation, or <b>arthrodesis</b> in the leg and hip. Depending on the type of skiing, the international classification process for LW2 skiers is handled by the IPC Alpine Skiing Technical Committee and IPC Nordic Skiing Technical Committee. National sport federations handle classification on the lower levels.|$|E
25|$|Arthrodesis: {{the fusion}} of the two bones of the pastern joints {{eliminates}} the instability of the joint, and thus the inflammation. This procedure may then eliminate the horse's lameness as well. However, surgical alteration of the joint can promote the growth of bone in the area, which is cosmetically displeasing. <b>Arthrodesis</b> of the coffin joint is usually not performed due {{to the location of}} the joint (within the hoof) and because the coffin joint needs some mobility for the horse to move correctly (unlike the pastern joint, which is very still).|$|E
2500|$|... <b>arthrodesis</b> â€“ {{surgical}} {{connection of}} adjacent bones so the bones can grow together into one. Spinal fusion {{is an example}} of adjacent vertebrae connected allowing them to grow together into one piece.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliotic adolescents, at {{the apex}} vertebra, have a higher muscle {{activity}} (as measured by surface electromyography) on the convex side than on the concave side in sitting or standing conditions. Because in scoliotic people wearing a brace, the muscle activity of the erector spinae muscles decreased on the convex side when walking with the brace [...] and because after spinal <b>arthrodesis</b> surgery, idiopathic scoliotic people showed {{a significant decrease in}} paravertebral muscle activity on the convex side but not on the concave side, the muscular asymmetry in idiopathic scoliosis is thought to be a biomechanical consequence of the scoliotic curvature rather than its cause.|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{standing}} classification used in para-Alpine skiing and para-Nordic skiing, where LW stands for Locomotor Winter. It {{is for people}} with a severe disability in a lower limb, which may {{be a result of}} an amputation, <b>arthrodesis</b> in the leg and hip, or a disease like polio. Competitors in this class would score 20 or less on a strength test for one leg. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) explicitly defined this classification for para-Alpine skiing as [...] "Competitors with severe disabilities in one lower limb... Typical disability profile of the class is single above-knee amputation." [...] For para-Nordic skiing, the IPC defines this class as [...] "those with impairment in one entire lower limb (involving pelvis structures distal)." [...] In 2002, the Australian Paralympic Committee described this classification for para-Alpine as {{a standing}} skiing classification with [...] "One ski, two poles, disability in one leg above the knee." [...] Cross Country Canada defined this classification for para-Nordic skiing as [...] "Impairment in one entire lower limb (leg) involving pelvis and structures distal" [...] in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> {{destroys the}} {{cartilage}} of the joint, producing ankylosis, {{and may also}} reduce pain immediately due to neurolysis. Often intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA) or ethyl alcohol is used. Ethyl alcohol has several advantages over MIA, including decreased pain (MIA produces severe pain for several hours following injection), lower cost, and easy access. Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> is commonly performed to treat osteoarthritis of the lower hock joints. These joints have little motion and can fuse without affecting {{the movement of the}} horse. Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> has the potential to greatly improve chronic lameness which is not responding to IA anti-inflammatories, but carries the risk of severe complications, including joint sepsis, cellulitis, and severe lameness. Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> is cheap, simple, and relatively noninvasive, but is potentially disastrous if the proximal intertarsal joint communicates with the high-motion tarsocrural joint. For this reason, a contrast study is often recommended prior to treatment to ensure no communication occurs between the two joints. Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> has the potential to damage the joint cartilage without fusing the joint, leading to increased pain and lameness. Chemical <b>arthrodesis</b> is less successful when used in the pastern joint, and often surgical <b>arthrodesis</b> is preferred.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} fewer options if the {{replacement}} fails, the main option being <b>arthrodesis</b> (surgical fusion of the joint) {{which results in}} a pain-free but lame gait. However <b>arthrodesis</b> is itself a complex surgery with a long recovery time, and if <b>arthrodesis</b> is required, additional strain will be borne by other nearby joints, so other leg and shoulder conditions such as osteoarthritis may become more significant.|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{management}} {{options include}} extensive cervical laminectomy {{with or without}} an additional posterior <b>arthrodesis,</b> anterior decompression and <b>arthrodesis,</b> and posterior cervical laminoplasty. Treatment decisions can be made based on a grading systems devised by Hirabayashi et al., supplemented by the Nurick myelopathy classification system.|$|E
50|$|Surgical <b>arthrodesis</b> may be {{produced}} by internal fixation, intra-articular drilling, intra-articular laser treatment (which damages chondrocytes), or surgical removal of joint cartilage to produce ankylosis. Surgical <b>arthrodesis</b> {{is used as a}} technique for treating pain in low-motion joints, such as the lower hock joints. When used in the lower hock joints, it has a high success rate for return to function, but is more expensive and invasive than chemical <b>arthrodesis.</b> Pastern osteoarthritis is also treated with surgical <b>arthrodesis,</b> and can lead to improved comfort and return to athletic function. Surgical <b>arthrodesis</b> may also be used in high-motion joints. Because it results in alteration of gait, the horse cannot be used for athletic pursuits following surgery. It is used as a salvaging procedure to save the horse with an injury that disrupts the stability of a joint, such as septic arthritis, failure of the suspensory apparatus, subluxation, fracture, or collateral ligament rupture, or may be used to treat chronic osteoarthritis. It is most commonly used to treat disease of the coffin, fetlock, carpal, and shoulder joints.|$|E

50|$|LW4 is a para-Alpine and para-Nordic {{standing}} skiing sport class {{defined by}} the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) for skiers who may have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee <b>arthrodesis</b> or a hip <b>arthrodesis.</b> For international skiing competitions, classification is done through IPC Alpine Skiing or IPC Nordic Skiing. A national federation such as Alpine Canada handles classification for domestic competitions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arthrodesis</b> {{is defined}} as, [...] "the {{surgical}} immobilization {{of a joint}} so that the bones grow solidly together." [...] <b>Arthrodesis</b> can relieve pain from arthritis and fractures. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} Allografts and Autografts. Allografts are done by creating bone grafts from a donor bone bank, while autografts are bone grafts from other bones in a patient's body. Synthetic bones and metal plates can also be inserted to abate the pain.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, the {{disadvantages}} of ankle <b>arthrodesis</b> and the excellent results attained by arthroplasty at other human joints have encouraged numerous prosthesis designs {{also for the}} ankle. In the following decade, the disappointing results of long-term follow-up clinical studies [...] of the pioneering designs has left ankle <b>arthrodesis</b> as the surgical treatment of choice for these patients. More modern designs have produced better results, contributing to {{a renewed interest in}} total ankle arthroplasty over the past decade.|$|E
50|$|Ankle replacement, or ankle arthroplasty, is a {{surgical}} procedure {{to replace the}} damaged articular surfaces of the human ankle joint with prosthetic components. This procedure is becoming the treatment of choice for patients, replacing the conventional use of <b>arthrodesis,</b> i.e. fusion of the bones. The restoration of range of motion is the key feature in favor of ankle replacement with respect to <b>arthrodesis.</b> However, clinical evidence of {{the superiority of the}} former has only been demonstrated for particular isolated implant designs.|$|E

50|$|After <b>arthrodesis,</b> all rachis {{ranges of}} motion {{decrease}} because of surgery but hips extension {{range of motion}} {{is comparable to the}} one of non-operated scoliotic people.|$|E
50|$|In {{this stage}} {{there are two}} {{surgical}} treatment options; total wrist arthroplasty and total wrist <b>arthrodesis.</b> Total wrist <b>arthrodesis</b> has become the standard surgical treatment for patients with stage IV wrist osteoarthritis. During this procedure the carpal bones are all fused together and are then fastened to the distal radius. Patients who still want to undertake heavy labor benefit the most of this surgical approach, because after surgery and recovery this is still possible. However, the arc of motion is extremely diminished by this type of surgery.|$|E
50|$|The use of dual tapered {{threaded}} fusion cages and {{recombinant human}} bone morphogenetic protein-2 on an absorbable collagen sponge obtained and maintained intervertebral spinal fusion, improved clinical outcomes, and reduced pain after anterior lumbar interbody <b>arthrodesis</b> {{in patients with}} degenerative lumbar disc disease. As an adjuvant to allograft bone or {{as a replacement for}} harvested autograft, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) appear to improve fusion rates after spinal <b>arthrodesis</b> in both animal models and humans, while reducing the donor-site morbidity previously associated with such procedures.|$|E

50|$|This {{classification}} {{is used in}} para-Alpine and para-Nordic standing skiing, where LW {{stands for}} Locomotor Winter. Skiers in this class have a disability in one lower extremity, which may {{be a result of}} a leg amputation below the knee, knee <b>arthrodesis</b> or a hip <b>arthrodesis.</b> If there are functional problems on the leg, the strength of the leg will be 30 or less, where a fully functional leg normally has a strength of 40.

50|$|Surgery is {{curative}} despite possible local relapses. Wide resection of {{the tumor}} and resection <b>arthrodesis</b> with an intramedullary nail, vertebrectomy and femoral head allograft replacement of the vertebral body, resection of the iliac wing and hip joint disarticulation {{have been among the}} performed procedures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arthrodesis,</b> {{also known}} as {{artificial}} ankylosis or syndesis, is the artificial induction of joint ossification between two bones by surgery. This is done to relieve intractable pain in a joint which cannot be managed by pain medication, splints, or other normally indicated treatments. The typical causes of such pain are fractures which disrupt the joint, severe sprains, and arthritis. It is most commonly performed on joints in the spine, hand, ankle, and foot. Historically, knee and hip arthrodeses were also performed as pain-relieving procedures, but with the great successes achieved in hip and knee arthroplasty, <b>arthrodesis</b> of these large joints has fallen out of favour as a primary procedure, and now is only used as a procedure of last resort in some failed arthroplasties.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{younger than}} 40 years {{have a big}} chance to develop {{osteoarthritis}} in the radiocapitate joint. These patients have longer to live, therefore the incongruence of the joint will exist for a longer time. Thus, in this patient population four-corner <b>arthrodesis</b> is the treatment of first choice. The capitate, lunate, hamate and triquetrum are bounded together in this procedure and the scaphoid is excised. Before the <b>arthrodesis</b> is executed, the lunate must be reduced out of DISI position. Because the radiolunate joint is typically preserved in stage II SLAC and SNAC wrists, this joint can be the only remaining joint of the proximal wrist. Both procedures are often combined with wrist denervation, {{as described in the}} text of treatment stage I.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} a variety of classifications of winged scapula, {{there is a}}lso more than one type of treatment. Massage Therapy is an {{effective}} initial approach to relax the damaged muscles. In more severe cases, Physical Therapy can help by strengthening effected and surrounding muscles. Physical therapy constitutes treatment options if there is weakness of the glenohumeral joint muscles, but if the muscles do not contract clinically and symptoms continue to be severe for more than 3-6 months, surgery may be the next choice. Surgery by fixation of the scapula to the rib cage can be done for those with isolated scapular winging. Some options are neurolysis (chordotomy), intercostal nerve transfer, scapulothoracic fusion, <b>arthrodesis</b> (scapulodesis), or scapulothoracis fixation without <b>arthrodesis</b> (scapulopexy).|$|E
