40|$|Objectives The {{development}} of methods {{to predict the}} transport of molecules across biological membranes, {{without the need for}} time-consuming collection of experimental data, is a rapidly growing science. The use of structural characteristics of molecules has been investigated to predict the maximum transport rates of molecules across skin epidermal and intestinal membranes, known as maximum flux and maximum <b>absorbable</b> <b>dose,</b> respectively, although different approaches have been used. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the relationship between polar surface area and number of rotatable bonds of molecules and their permeability through intestinal membranes could be applied to the permeation of solutes through the epidermis following topical application...|$|E
