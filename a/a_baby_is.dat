5|$|After brief {{footage of}} a tank driving across a desert {{landscape}} <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> shown {{playing with a}} paper aeroplane. A hat {{is placed on the}} baby's head and the head is then removed and fitted onto the body of a bomber pilot. The next scene shows a fleet of bombers bombing a city while an anti-aircraft gunner fires at them and troops parachute down. A soldier is seen running across a bombed out city before two opposing troops are shown repeatably stabbing each other with bayonets on a battlefield landscape filled with human skulls. This scene is intercut with footage of two military leaders playing chess.|$|E
5|$|Keen gets to {{the girl}} first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani's forces. Now aware of Keen, Zamani attacks her husband, Tom, in their home, gravely {{wounding}} him. Keen notes a stamp on the man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt <b>a</b> <b>baby,</b> <b>is</b> not what he appears to be.|$|E

25|$|In older traditions, if {{the name}} of <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> not chosen by the third trimester, the {{responsibility}} of choosing the name fell to the oldest son of the family. Often, this was the preferred method as the name chosen was seen as good luck.|$|E
25|$|Artificial teats (nipples) or dummies (pacifiers) can {{suppress}} the sucking reflex in infants. In addition, when <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> {{put to the}} breast for shorter periods of time, milk production decreases. The time spent sucking by the infant on the pacifier or artifical teat reduces {{the time on the}} breast.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 it was {{reported}} that a 20-year-old man whose father had him ritually circumcised as <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> preparing to sue the doctor who circumcised him.

25|$|It is now {{accepted}} that the neonate responds more extensively to pain than the adult does, and {{that exposure to}} severe pain, without adequate treatment, can have long-term consequences. Despite the difficulty of assessing how much pain <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> experiencing, and the practical problem of prescribing the correct dosage or technique for treatment, modern medicine is firmly committed to {{improving the quality of}} pain relief for the very young.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{techniques}} used to examine how infants perceive speech, besides the head-turn procedure mentioned above, is measuring their sucking rate. In such an experiment, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> sucking a special nipple while presented with sounds. First, the baby's normal sucking rate is established. Then a stimulus is played repeatedly. When the baby hears the stimulus {{for the first time}} the sucking rate increases but as the baby becomes habituated to the stimulation the sucking rate decreases and levels off. Then, a new stimulus is played to the baby. If the baby perceives the newly introduced stimulus as different from the background stimulus the sucking rate will show an increase. The sucking-rate and the head-turn method are some of the more traditional, behavioral methods for studying speech perception. Among the new methods (see Research methods below) that help us to study speech perception, near-infrared spectroscopy is widely used in infants.|$|E
25|$|The penanggalan {{is another}} type of female vampire {{attracted}} to the blood of newborn infants, which appears {{as the head of}} a woman from which her entrails trail, used to grasp her victim. There are several stories of her origins. One is that she was a woman who was sitting meditating in a large wooden vat used for making vinegar when she was so startled that her head jumped up from her body, pulling her entrails with it. Another has her as a normal woman during the day, whose head and entrails leave her body at night. If <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> expected, branches from a type of thistle are placed around the doors or windows to protect the house, since her entrails will be caught by the thorns. The penanggalan is known in Thai as krasue and a similar Philippine ghost called the manananggal which preys on pregnant women with an elongated proboscis-like tongue.|$|E

25|$|Images of {{children}} {{on the path to}} destruction also litter the scene: aside from the dead baby on the spike and the child falling to its death, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> quieted by its mother with a cup of gin, and in the background of the scene an orphaned infant bawls naked on the floor as the body of its mother is loaded into a coffin on orders of the beadle. Two young girls who are wards of the parish of St Giles—indicated by the badge on the arm of one of the girls—each take a glass. Hogarth also chose the slum of St Giles as setting for the first scene of The Four Stages of Cruelty, which he issued almost simultaneously with Beer Street and Gin Lane. Tom Nero, the central character of the Cruelty series wears an identical arm badge. In front of the pawnbroker's door a starving boy and a dog fight over a bone, while next to them a girl has fallen asleep; approaching her is a snail, emblematic of the sin of sloth.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of a {{computer}} generated man with a guitar and sunglasses walking down a set of spiral stairs singing along with [...] "It's Not the End of the World?'s" [...] chorus. <b>A</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> then shown playing with a toy tank before a man seen receiving his call up papers, having his head shaved by a barber then leaving on a steam train as people outside wave goodbye. The next shot features a battleship—the video then cuts to a small boy playing with a toy ship in the bath before joints of meat on hooks are seen moving {{from right to left}} through a tiled room spattered with blood. A shot of a military commander on horseback addressing his troops appears before the second chorus which again features a guitarist singing along as he walks down spiral stairs.|$|E
500|$|... 18–24 months: Invention of New Means Through Mental Combination – The child fully {{understand}}s object permanence. They {{will not}} fall for A-not-B errors. Also, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> {{able to understand}} the concept of items that are hidden in containers. [...] If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will look under the pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox. The child is able to develop a mental image, hold it in mind, and manipulate it to solve problems, including object permanence problems that are not based solely on perception. The child can now reason about where the object may be when invisible displacement occurs.|$|E

500|$|Cisneros often {{incorporates}} Spanish {{into her}} English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where {{she feels that}} Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves {{the rhythm of the}} passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: [...] "La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house." [...] Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates {{it in a way that}} does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: [...] "And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy." [...] Previous sentences inform the reader that <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that [...] "I gave light" [...] is a literal translation of the Spanish [...] "dí a luz" [...] which means [...] "I gave birth." [...] Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: [...] "All of a sudden something happens to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language." [...] Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, [...] "the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects" [...] were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.|$|E

2500|$|A Latin {{translation}} of Ibn Tufail's work, Philosophus Autodidactus, {{first appeared in}} 1671, prepared by Edward Pococke the Younger, followed by an English translation by Simon Ockley in 1708, as well as German and Dutch translations. These translations later inspired Daniel Defoe to write Robinson Crusoe, {{a candidate for the}} title of [...] "first novel in English". Philosophus Autodidactus also inspired Robert Boyle to write his own philosophical novel set on an island, The Aspiring Naturalist. The story also anticipated Rousseau's [...] in some ways, and is also similar to Mowgli's story in Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as well as Tarzan's story, in that <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> abandoned but taken care of and fed by a mother wolf.|$|E
2500|$|For reasons unknown, H. Bonciu {{refused to}} openly {{affiliate}} {{with any of}} the many interwar literary factions which thrived in Greater Romania. In his 1937 companion to 20th century literature, Eugen Lovinescu described him as a paradoxical, outdated and eccentric author: [...] "the eagerness for novelty, for situations and expressions dominates but since the novelty dates back to the age of Expressionism, it is currently more outdated than the most up-to-date literature." [...] Writing in 2005, Simona Vasilache presented Bonciu as [...] "a lonely dreamer, terrified by the world like <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> of bad dreams". Researcher Paul Cernat also presented Bonciu as isolated from the Romanian avant-garde, and as such [...] "perhaps a franc-tireur".|$|E

She also stated {{that the way to}} ensure the future wealth of <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>is</b> to put part of the child's umbilical cord in a bag together with a few coins. Lucky coins are lucky charms which are carried around attract wealth and good luck, whilst many, often silver coins, attached to bracelets multiply the effect as well as create a noise which scares away evil spirits.
