Studies conducted with animal models of lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas revealed that malignant T and B cells, like their normal counterparts, {{have their origin in}} central lymphoid tissues. The thymus is essential in the genesis of a vari-ety of murine lymphoid malignancies that are induced by oncogenic viruses, ionizing irradiation, carcinogenic hydrocarbons, and hormones, or that arise spontaneously in AKR mice (reviewed [2]). Removal of the thymus prevents these lymphoid malig-nancies, and thymus transplants restore susceptibility [2 - 41.

50|$|Virus insertional {{mutagenesis}} is possible with both replication competent virus and the self-inactivating vectors that {{are commonly used}} in gene therapy.

40|$|The {{release of}} retroviruses from cells {{requires}} ubiquitination of Gag and recruitment of cellular proteins involved in endosome sorting, including the ESCRT-III proteins and the Vps 4 ATPase. In response to infection, cells have evolved an interferon-induced mechanism to block virus replication through {{expression of the}} interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15), a dimer homologue of ubiquitin, which interferes with ubiquitin pathways in cells. Previously, {{it has been reported}} that ISG 15 expression inhibited the E 3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd 4, and prevented association of the ESCRT-I protein Tsg 101 with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Gag. The budding of <b>avian</b> sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> virus and HIV- 1 Gag virus-like particles containing L-domain mutations can be rescued by fusion to ESCRT proteins, which cause entry into the budding pathway beyond these early steps. The release of these fusions from cells was susceptible to inhibition by ISG 15, indicating that there was a block late in the budding process. We now demonstrate that the Vps 4 protein does not associate with the <b>avian</b> sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> virus or the HIV- 1 budding complexes when ISG 15 is expressed. This is caused by a loss in interaction between Vps 4 with its coactivator protein LIP 5 needed to promote the formation of the ESCRT-III-Vps 4 double-hexamer complex required for membrane scission and virus release. The inability of LIP 5 to interact with Vps 4 is the probable result of ISG 15 conjugation to the ESCRT-III protein, CHMP 5, which regulates the availability of LIP 5. Thus, there appear to be multiple levels of ISG 15 -induced inhibition acting at different stages of the virus release process...|$|R

This indicates that gga-miR- 375 is frequently downregulated in <b>avian</b> <b>leukosis</b> by inhibiting cell proliferation through YAP 1 oncogene targeting. Overexpression of gga-miR- 375 markedly promoted serum starvation induced apoptosis, and there may be the reason why the tumour cycle is so long in the infected chickens.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fusion protein}} of <b>avian</b> sarcoma and <b>leukosis</b> virus {{is likely to}} fold into a six-helix bundle {{as part of its}} final configuration. A peptide, R 99, {{inhibits}} fusion, probably by binding into the grooves of the triple-stranded coiled coil that becomes the central core of the six-helix bundle. The stages at which the envelope protein (Env) of <b>avian</b> sarcoma and <b>leukosis</b> virus subgroup A folds into a bundle during low pH-induced fusion were determined. Effector cells expressing Env were bound to target cells expressing the cognate receptor Tva, and intermediates of fusion were created. R 99 was added and the extent of fusion inhibition was used to distinguish between a prebundle state with exposed grooves and a state in which the grooves were no longer exposed. The native conformation of Env was not sensitive to R 99. But adding a soluble form of Tva to effector cells conferred sensitivity. Acidic pH applied at low temperature created an intermediate state of local hemifusion. Surprisingly, R 99 caused these locally hemifused membranes to separate. This indicates that the grooves of Env were still exposed, that prebundle configurations of Env stabilized hemifused states, and that binding of R 99 altered the conformation of Env. In the presence of an inhibitory lipid that blocks fusion before hemifusion, applying low pH at 37 °C created an intermediate in which R 99 was without effect. This suggests that the six-helix bundle can form before hemifusion and that subsequent conformational changes, such as formation of the trimeric hairpin, are responsible for pore formation and/or growth...|$|R
