5000|$|The basic SOON {{telescope}} is a 25 cm evacuated refractor {{mounted on a}} polar axis. It has a tunable monochromatic filter centered on the hydrogen-alpha absorption line at [...] in the Sun's light spectrum. Shifting the filter's characteristics slightly away {{from the center of}} the H-alpha peak results in pictures of the solar surface region at differing depths. Corresponding to the optical images of solar regions are the digital [...] "brightness-area" [...] data. These data are often plotted as brightness-area histograms for a particular time or, in a 3-3-dimensional display, showing a time sequence of changing intensity of optical emissions from areas of solar active regions. The automatic capability of the SOON telescope system allows the rapid collection of this brightness-area information on many active regions on the sun. By using these data, quantitative measures can be determined, include instability, growth/decay rates, and precise dimensions for each <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

Calibrations of the crystal curvature, the angle between a crystal reference plane and the collimator axis, and the position response of the position-sensitive proportional counter in determining absolute wavelengths are also mentioned.

30|$|Unlike the {{potential}} field, the LFFF can yield the free magnetic energy. In general, however, the observed force-free α {{measured in the}} photosphere varies in space. In particular, in <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> the coefficient α attains high values close to the PIL and small values far from the PIL. This implies that the LFFF is inappropriate for modeling <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> Therefore, we need to obtain the NLFFF extrapolation by using the observed force-free α, i.e., we need to obtain not only the normal component of the magnetic field but also the horizontal components at the photosphere in order to reproduce the magnetic field of a <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region.</b>|$|R
40|$|Review of some Harvard Observatory {{programs}} aimed at defining the physical conditions in quiet and <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>regions</b> {{on the basis of}} data obtained from the OSO-IV and OSO-VI spacecraft. The spectral range covered is from 300 A to 1400 A. This spectral range consists of emission lines and continua from abundant elements such as hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, aluminum, neon, iron, and calcium in various ionization states ranging from neutral to 15 times ionized. The structure is discussed of the quiet solar atmosphere as deduced from center-to-limb behavior of spectral lines and continua formed in the chromosphere and corona. In reviewing investigations of <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> it is shown that the structure of these regions varies in a complicated manner from point to point. The local structure is influenced by factors such as the magnetic field configuration within the active region and the age or evolutionary state of the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} and dynamics of magnetic fields on the Sun’s photosphere and outer layers – notably those within <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> – govern the eruptive {{activity of the}} Sun. These photospheric magnetic fields also act as the evolving lower boundary of the Sun-Earth coupled system. Quantifying the physical attributes of these magnetic fields and exploring the mechanisms underlying their influence on the near-Earth space environment are of vital importance for forecasting and mitigating adverse space weather effects. In this context, we discuss here a novel technique for measuring twist in the magnetic field lines of <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> that does not invoke the force-free field assumption. Twist in <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> {{can play an important}} role in flaring activity and the initiation of CMEs via the kink instability mechanism; we outline a procedure for determining this <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> eruptive potential. We also discuss how twist in active region magnetic fields can be used as inputs in simulations of the coronal and heliospheric fields; specifically, we explore through simulations, the formation, evolution and ejection of magnetic flux ropes that originate in twisted magnetic structures. The results and ideas presented here are relevant for exploring the role of twisted <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> magnetic fields and flux ropes as drivers of space weather in the Sun-Earth system.

40|$|A {{technique}} for analyzing measurements of XUV spectral-line intensities is described.

One active-region spectrum shows evidence for substantial quantities of coronal material with temperatures between 2 and 3. 5 million K. Measurements from limb spectra show evidence that (1) coronal abundances of N and O are low relative to heavier elements; or (2) that the ionization-equilibrium calculations used may contain systematic errors; or (3) that the XUV intensity measurements may be incorrectly calibrated...|$|R
40|$|One hundred loops {{interconnecting}} 94 separate <b>active</b> <b>solar</b> <b>regions</b> detectable in soft X-rays {{were identified}} during the Skylab mission. While close active regions are commonly interconnected with loops, {{the number of}} such interconnections decreases steeply for longer distances; the longest interconnecting loop observed in the Skylab data connected regions separated by 37 deg. Several arguments are presented which support the point of view that this is the actual limit of the size of magnetic interconnections between active regions. No sympathetic flares could be found in the interconnected regions. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that accelerated particles can be guided in interconnecting loops from one active region to another over distances of 100 deg or more and eventually produce sympathetic flares in them...|$|R

40|$|Twist is a {{component}} of magnetic helicity that describes the wrapping of magnetic field lines about the axis of a <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> flux tube. Recent studies point out {{that in addition to}} governing the energetics of <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> twisted flux tubes may {{play an important role in}} triggering eruptive flares and coronal mass ejections via the magnetohydrodynamic kink instability mechanism. Therefore, accurate, quantitative determination of twist is important. The most widely used technique till-date for measuring twist is based on the force-free-field equation. However, the latter’s applicability is questionable at the photospheric layer, which is known not to be force-free and where routine vector magnetic field observations are made. Here, we present a new flux-tube-fitting technique for measuring the twist of <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> magnetic fields that does not rely on the force-free-field equation. We also discuss an application of this technique that can be used to determine the susceptibility of <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> flux tubes to the kink instability. This new method is applicable to photospheric, chromospheric and coronal magnetograms and can scale up to high spatial resolutions. Therefore, we envisage that it will be useful for studying active region sub-structures from high resolution data expected in the future.

By having the wave plates calibrated, the data obtained from solar flares can be analyzed and meaningful information provided to the investigators. The polarimeter has two wave plates with different optical characteristics to provide both redundancy and versatility. A four mirror polarizer was added behind one wave plate to provide additional polarization.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 54) A {{solid state}} imaging system designed and {{developed at the}} San Fernando Observatory (SFO) has been actively employed to study solar irradiance fluctuations. Solid state imaging by areal (two dimensional) photometry presents {{a unique opportunity to}} determine the solar brightness excesses or deficits associated with sunspots and faculae. Monochromatic photometry at 6264 ?? was performed with a 512 element linear diode array. Irradiance fluctuations were measured for the sunspots and faculae in a major <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> during its disk transit in September, 1982. The monochromatic digital images were analyzed on the Cyber 750 mainframe computer located at California State University, Northridge. It was found that the net luminosity fluctuation due to this active region was - 27 x 10 - 6 relative to that of the quiet sun. When this luminosity fluctuation was converted into energy, it was found that an energy fluctuation of - 6 x 1034 ergs could be attributed to the <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region.</b> The major objective of these observations was to add to the data set of the energy balance of a <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>region</b> during the course of its lifetime. This work is part of an ongoing effort at SFO to accomplish this endeavor.

40|$|Dynamic {{processes}} {{occurring in}} <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> {{are dominated by}} the solar magnetic field. As of now, observations using a solar magnetograph have supplied us with the vector components of a solar photospheric magnetic field. The two transverse components of a photospheric magnetic field allow us to compute the amount of electric current. We found that the electric current in areas with positive (negative) polarity due to the longitudinal magnetic field have {{both positive and negative}} signs in an active region, however, the net current is found to be an order-of-magnitude less than the mean absolute magnitude and has a preferred sign. In particular, we have statistically found that there is a systematic net electric current from areas with negative (positive) polarity to areas with positive (negative) polarity in <b>solar</b> <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> in the northern (southern) hemisphere, but during the solar minimum this tendency is reversed over time at some latitudes.
