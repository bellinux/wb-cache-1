500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E
500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom, and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time I put it together <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, but they say so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{appearance}} in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. [...] "As far as I know, I was doing one episode. That's what I signed up for. But because of who the character was, {{there was a lot}} of room for him to come back. I got real lucky, they invited me back." [...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, [...] "It was a spectacular entrance. It was all about this brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>my</b> hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." ...|$|E
