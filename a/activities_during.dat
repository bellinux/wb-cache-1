5|$|Neville's <b>activities</b> <b>during</b> {{the years}} {{immediately}} after 1207 are unknown, owing {{to the lack of}} royal records, but in December 1213 he was given custody of the Great Seal of the kingdom. He was Dean of Lichfield by 11 April 1214, at which time he held a prebend in the diocese of London. Neville was appointed to the royal chancery in about 1214, largely through the patronage of Peter des Roches, the Bishop of Winchester and one of the king's favourites. From March to October 1214, Neville was in France with the king. After the king returned to England after 1214, Neville remained in royal service until at least May 1216, although without custody of the Great Seal. His <b>activities</b> <b>during</b> the final period of John's reign prior to the king's sudden death in October 1216 are unknown.|$|E

Plasma AVP and OT concentrations were measured 3 times a day (8 : 00, 16 : 00, and 23 : 00 hrs) and day and nighttime wrist <b>activity</b> were measured <b>during</b> a period of 5 consecutive days and nights. Principal component analysis revealed 3 components of motor activity: motor <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> wakefulness, motor <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> sleep, and the awake/sleep time ratio. In patients and controls an inverse relationship between plasma AVP concentrations and motor <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> wakefulness was found.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the association between unwanted sexual <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> childhood and risky behaviors among a sample of predominantly African American and Hispanic men. Methods: Data were obtained from baseline interviews completed by 2676 men enrolled in a multisite HIV prevention trial. Results: Approximately 25 % of the men reported unwanted or uninvited sexual activity before 13 years of age, with Hispanic men more likely than African American men to report unwanted sexual <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> childhood. Men {{with a history of}} unwanted sexual <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> childhood {{were more likely to report}} unwanted sexual activity since age 13, the buying and selling of sex, problems with alcohol, and drug use. Men who reported unwanted sexual <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> childhood also reported a significantly greater frequency of unprotected sexual acts and more partners. Conclusions: Among men at high risk for HIV infection, unwanted sexual <b>activity</b> <b>during</b> childhood is more widespread than previously described and can increase the risk of participating in harmful health practices during adulthood, including risky sexual behaviors...|$|R

5|$|Giant mouse lemurs begin {{foraging}} {{moments before}} the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social <b>activities</b> <b>during</b> {{the last half of}} the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal torpor.|$|E
