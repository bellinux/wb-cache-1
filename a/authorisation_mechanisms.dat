Second, we propose an architectural solution that incorporates self-adaptation into OpenStack, {{in order to deal}} with insider threats at the user level. This architectural solution is defined in the context of OpenStack components that are responsible for dealing with authorisation issues based on the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) model [26]. Third, we have developed a prototype for experimenting and evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of self-adaptive <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in dealing with insider threats in a cloud platform, like OpenStack. For the evaluation, we have identified several potential insider threats scenarios, and for dealing with these threats, we have define potential responses from a self-adaptive authorisation infrastructure that is integrated with OpenStack.|$|E

Such scenarios involve communication between federated and heterogeneous workflow engines. However, state-of-the-art workflow engines {{fall short of}} a distributed <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for this heterogeneous, federated BPO setting. In a cross-organisational context, the security requirements involve (i) delegation and verification of privileges in a confidential manner, (ii) secure asynchronous operations during the long-term workflows even when the users are logged-off, and (iii) controlling access to interfaces of the different workflow engines involved. To address these challenges, we present a voucher-based authorisation architecture and middleware. We extended the WF-Interop middleware with a security module to support this authorisation architecture.

40|$|In this paper, a {{differentiated}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is described, {{which is}} based on the user location control process, and exploits the interconnection between the hierarchies of user roles, data sets and user locations. User authorizations defined in this way permit the specification of different access rights depending on the set of user locations that may change dynamically. A static algorithm is presented {{that could be used for}} determining all location-dependent authorization rules in every administrative domain. It results however in a big number of entries. To overcome this problem, an alternative dynamic algorithm is proposed, which uses the authorization rules that are derived from a minimum number of initial entries. This dynamic approach results to a significant reduction of the required storage space for security metadata, a feature that is particularly useful when the resources of hosts are scarce, as for example in mobile computing environments...|$|R
40|$|Authorised users (insiders) {{are behind}} the {{majority}} of security incidents with high financial impacts. Because authorisation {{is the process of}} controlling users’ access to resources, improving authorisation techniques may mitigate the insider threat. Current approaches to authorisation suffer from the assumption that users will (can) not depart from the expected behaviour implicit in the authorisation policy. In reality however, users can and do depart from the canonical behaviour. This paper argues that the conflict of interest between insiders and <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is analogous to the subset of problems formally studied in the field of game theory. It proposes a game theoretic authorisation model that can ensure users’ potential misuse of a resource is explicitly considered while making an authorisation decision.

These firms {{have to cope}} with a high variety of customised products, and strong pressure to provide short throughput times.

Unfortunately, there is an apparent lack of research in Digital Ecosystem security mechanisms due to its newly emerged technology. Our review on the existing protection mechanisms from the established technology such as peer-to-peer, grid computing, and clientserver appears not to meet the Digital Ecosystem requirements.

40|$|Securing {{provenance}} {{has recently}} {{become an important}} research topic, resulting {{in a number of}} models for protecting access to provenance. Existing work has focused on graph transformation mechanisms that supply a user with a provenance view that satisfies both access control policies and validity constraints of provenance. However, it is not always possible to satisfy both of them simultaneously, because these two conditions are often inconsistent which require sophisticated conflict resolution strategies to be put in place. In this paper we develop a new access control model tailored for provenance. In particular, we explicitly take into account validity constraints of provenance when specifying certain parts of provenance to which access is restricted. Hence, a provenance view that is granted to a user by our <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanism</b> would automatically satisfy the validity constraints. Moreover, we propose algorithms that allow provenance owners to deploy fine-grained access control for their provenance data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{capabilities}} of mobile devices are continuously increas-ing in processor speed, storage, and communications. These continuous enhancements enforce {{their presence in}} new and traditional applications, specially in ad-hoc and P 2 P networks. This article shows lacks in the security support of the mobile devices operating systems, which presently only offer encryption capabilities and some authentication schemes to control the physical access, but insufficient protection of device resources and in the secure communication management. To overcome such lacks, we propose an enhanced security architecture for mobile devices, which adds a trust manager {{in compliance with the}} pervasive trust management (PTM) model and a <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on degrees of trust, TrustAC. We aim at enhancing PKI for large communities of end users, because it is the only standardised by ITU, and because it is the only one being used (but some applications for network managers using SPKI).

Home users are unsure of how the configuration of their computers affects the risk profile for conducting online banking. Software installed by a home user on their computer may be malware designed to steal banking details. Customers expect banks to provide a safe online banking system. The challenge that banks have is that they cannot control the configuration that exists on a client operating system. The V-Bank system was designed to determine whether virtualisation {{can be used as a}} means to increase the security for online banking. The V-Bank system uses a virtual machine that is run from a guest that is single purpose, read-only and fulfils the configuration requirements that the bank has for a client system. The V-Bank system also utilises public and private key encryption for identification, authentication and <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the online banking system. The architecture of the V-Bank system defines online banking as an end-to-end system. It approaches online banking as a system that consists of three major components. The three major components is a client-side component, network and server-side environment. The V-Bank system gives banks the ability to provide customers with a system that is controlled from the client, through the network to the server.

While commercial functions can be shared among a variety of strategic allies - including business partners and customers, extranets {{appear to be the}} cost-effective solution to providing global connectivity for different user groups. Because extranets allow third-party users into corporate networks, they need to be extremely secure and external access needs to be highly controllable. Access control and <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> must be in place to regulate user access to information/resources {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the current set of policies and practices both at intra-organisational and cross-organisational levels. In the business-to-customer (B 2 C) e-commerce setting, a service provider faces a wide spectrum of new customers, who may not have pre-existing relationships established. Thus the authorisation problem is particularly complex. In this thesis, a new authorisation scheme is proposed to facilitate the service provider to establish trust with potential customers, grant access privileges to legitimate users and enforce access control in a diversified commercial environment. Four modules with a number of innovative components and mechanisms suitable for distributed authorisation on extranets are developed: * One-shot Authorisation Module - One-shot authorisation token is designed as a flexible and secure credential for access control enforcement in client/server systems; * Token-Based Trust Establishment Module - Trust token is proposed for server-centric trust establishment in virtual enterprise environment. * User-Centric Anonymous Authorisation Module - One-task authorisation key and anonymous attribute certificate are developed for anonymous authorisation in a multi-organisational setting; * Agent-Based Privilege Negotiation Module - Privilege negotiation agents are proposed to provide dynamic authorisation services with secure client agent environment for hosting these agents on user's platfor...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} specifies a Set of Concepts and a Conceptual Model for Compliant Management Systems (CMSs). The Set of Concepts {{is drawn}} from existing methodologies and the CMS Model, {{which is based on}} the Concepts, is evaluated against a compiled Set of Standard Requirements. The dissertation is analytical, conceptual and argumentative in nature. The Model is designed to enable the future development of compliant, efficient and globally functional organisational Information Technology (IT) Systems. The Three Central Requirements of the Model – Compliance (essentially a Legal requirement), Efficiency (essentially a Business Management requirement) and Global Functionality (essentially an IT requirement) – necessitated a multi-disciplinary investigation in the Legal, Business Management and IT areas. Compliance was the focus of the research as initial investigations showed no significant solutions existed that provided specific guidelines for the design of inherently compliant IT systems. As compliance relates to meeting regulatory requirements on a local or jurisdictional basis, whereas efficiency and global functionality favour global standards for IT systems (that enable system interoperability), the means for delivering “globally compliant” IT systems is problematic. The research therefore took the approach of “thinking globally and acting locally” by designing a Model appropriate for individual local organisations that can be used, in association with the development of appropriate regulation, as a template for globally compliant IT systems. It was found that the issues of Privacy, Consent, and Accountability were at the core of compliance requirements and that Digital Service Contracts with systematic <b>Authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for contract parties (represented as IT System “Groups”) provided the means for assuring compliance. The Model proposes software based on Service, Group and Service Contract components – the Service Contract components fulfilling Legal requirements, the Service components fulfilling Business Management requirements and the Group components fulfilling IT requirements. The Model description in the dissertation focuses on the IT System design. Technical (software design) issues are not explored in detail, making the dissertation readable to persons with minimal IT background. The aim was to draw together existing knowledge in the Legal, Business Management and IT disciplines and to explore relationships between the fields at a high level rather than to delve in detail into any of the three disciplines. The research spans many fields within the three research disciplines, including Contract Law, Privacy Law, Company Law, Legal Consent, Franchising Systems, Business Process Management, Service Oriented Architectures, Cloud Computing, Access Control, Authorisation, Operating Systems, Data Management and Object Oriented Programming...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} our recent GridShibPERMIS project to provide policy-driven role-based access control decision making to Grid jobs, in which the user’s attributes are provided by a Shibboleth Identity Provider (IdP). The goal of the project is to integrate the identity-federation and attribute-assignment functions of Shibboleth with the policy-based enforcement function of PERMIS, in order to provide a flexible fine-grained authorisation system for Grid jobs running under Globus Toolkit v 4. This was done by taking the GT 4 -Shibboleth integration performed in the United States with the PERMIS infrastructure built in the United Kingdom, and developing a GridShibPERMIS Context Handler. This allows for interoperability between GridShib and PERMIS by providing the required attribute extraction, conversion and transfer functions. As a result, the GridShibPERMIS project integrates the advantages of both Shibboleth cross-organisation identity federation and PERMIS policy-driven role-based access control and represents a new avenue of policy-based authorisation for Grids.

40|$|Today {{two major}} {{technological}} forces drive the telecommunication era: the wireless cellular {{systems and the}} Internet. As these forces converge, the demand for new services, increasing bandwidth and ubiquitous connectivity continuously grows. The next-generation mobile systems will be based solely or in a large extent, on the Internet Protocol (IP). This thesis begins by addressing the problems and challenges faced in a multimedia, IP-based Wireless LAN environment. The ETSI HiperLAN/ 2 system has been mainly selected as the test wireless network for our theoretical and simulation experiments. Apart from the simulations, measurements have been taken from real life test scenarios, where the IEEE 802. 11 system was used (UniS Test-bed). Furthermore, {{a brief overview of}} the All-IP network infrastructure is presented. An extension to the conventional wireless (cellular) architecture, which takes advantage of the IP network characteristics, is considered. Some of the trends driving the 3 G and WLANs developments are explored, while the provision of quality of service on the latter for real-time and non-real-time multimedia services is investigated, simulated and evaluated. Finally, an efficient and catholic Q 0 S framework is proposed. At the same time, the multimedia services should be offered in a seamless and uninterrupted manner to users who access the all-IP infrastructure via a WLAN, meeting the demands of both enterprise and public environments anywhere and anytime. Thus providing support for mobile communications {{not only in terms of}} terminal mobility, as is currently the case, but also for session, service and personal mobility. Furthermore, this mobility should be available over heterogeneous networks, such as WLANs, IJMTS, as well as fixed networks. Therefore, this work investigates issues such as, multilayer and multi-protocol (SIP-Mobile IP-Cellular IP) mobility management in wireless LAN and 3 G domains. Several local and global mobility protocols and architectures have been tested and evaluated and a complete mobility management framework is proposed. Moreover, integration of simple yet efficient authentication, accounting and <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with the multimedia service architecture is an important issue of IP-based WLANs. Without such integration providers will not have the necessary means to control their provided services and make revenue from the users. The proposed AAA architecture should support a robust AAA infrastructure providing secure, fast and seamless access granting to multimedia services. On the other hand, a user wishing a service from the All-IP WLAN infrastructure needs to be authenticated twice, once to get access to the network and the other one should be granted for the required service. Hence, we provide insights into these issues by simulating and evaluating pre-authentication techniques and other network authentication scenarios based on the wellknown IEEE 802. lx protocol for multimedia IP-based WLANs. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with authorisation issues for mobile code in mobile systems. It {{is divided into three}} main parts. Part I covers the development of a policy-based framework for the authorisation of mobile code and agents by host systems. Part II addresses the secure download, storage and execution of a conditional access application, used in the secure distribution of digital video broadcast content. Part III explores the way in which trusted computing technology may be used in the robust implementation of OMA DRM version 2. In part I of this thesis, we construct a policy-based mobile code and agent authorisation framework, with the objective of providing both mobile devices and service providers with the ability to assign appropriate privileges to incoming executables. Whilst mobile code and agent <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have previously been considered in a general context, this thesis focuses on the special requirements resulting from mobile code and agent authorisation in a mobile environment, which restrict the types of solutions that may be viable. Following the description and analysis of a number of architectural models upon which a policy-based framework for mobile code and agent authorisation may be constructed, we outline a list of features desirable in the definitive underlying architecture. Specific implementation requirements for the capabilities of the policy and attribute certificate specification languages and the associated policy engine are then extracted. Candidate policy specification languages, namely KeyNote (and Nereus), Ponder (and (D) TPL) and SAML are then examined, and conclusions drawn regarding their suitability for framework expression. Finally, the definitive policy based framework for mobile code and agent authorisation is described. In the second part of this thesis, a flexible approach that allows consumer products to support a wide range of proprietary content protection systems, or more specifically digital video broadcast conditional access systems, is proposed. Two protocols for the secure download of content protection software to mobile devices are described. The protocols apply concepts from trusted computing to demonstrate that a platform is in a sufficiently trustworthy state before any application or associated keys are securely downloaded. The protocols are designed to allow mobile devices to receive broadcast content protected by proprietary conditional access applications. Generic protocols are first described, followed by an analysis of how well the downloaded code is protected in transmission. How the generic protocols may be implemented using specific trusted computing technologies is then investigated. For each of the selected trusted computing technologies, an analysis of how the conditional access application is protected while in storage and while executing on the mobile host is also presented. We then examine two previously proposed download protocols, which assume a mobile receiver compliant with the XOM and AEGIS system architectures. Both protocols are then analysed against the security requirements defined for secure application download, storage and execution. We subsequently give a series of proposed enhancements to the protocols which are designed to address the identified shortcomings. In the final section of this thesis, we examine OMA DRM version 2, which defines the messages, protocols and mechanisms necessary in order to control the use of digital content in a mobile environment. However, an organisation, such as the CMLA, must specify how robust implementations of the OMA DRM version 2 specification should be, so that content providers can be confident that their content will be safe on OMA DRM version 2 devices. We take the requirements extracted for the robust implementation of the OMA DRM version 2 specification and propose an implementation which meets these requirements using the TCG architecture and TPM/TSS version 1. 2 commands...|$|E

(Information Technology) With mobile {{payments}} and mobile wallets {{becoming more and}} more popular, researchers are actively investing more time and funds intro creating solutions that can offer better convenience, efficiency and security in order to make mobile payments easier, faster and more secure. With huge economic boosts that mobile {{payments and}} mobile wallets provide, malicious and rogue activities constantly increase and improve in their efficacy. These malicious and rogue activities aim at compromising the security and confidentiality of the mobile payment applications and mobile wallets. The purpose of the research presented within this dissertation is to explore a mobile payment application that does not require the need for any mobile wallet system. With time becoming a constraining factor and mobility more demanded, consumers are inclined to weigh the benefit of speed, efficiency and convenience against security, even though they are well aware of the potential security threats and risks they face. As numerous research articles focus on the use of mobile wallets for mobile payments, this dissertation presents a unique illustration of enabling mobile payments in a person to person and person to point-of-sale (POS) setting. Furthermore, this dissertation investigates the use of Near Field Communication as a means of transferring payment information from a payee to a payer. The use of NFC therefore eliminates the requirement of having to type in account information – which could lead to erroneous payments being made. Lastly, an improved identification, authentication and <b>authorisation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that can ensure legitimate usage of the mobile payment system is also described...|$|R

40|$|When {{investigating}} {{the performance of}} running scientific/ commercial workflows in parallel and distributed systems, we often take into account only the resources allocated to the tasks constituting the workflow, assuming that computational resources will accept the tasks and execute them to completion once the processors are available. In reality, and in particular in Grid or e-business environments, security policies may be implemented in the individual organisations in which the computational resources reside. It is therefore expedient to have methods to calculate the performance of executing workflows under security policies. Authorisation control, which specifies who is allowed to perform which tasks when, {{is one of the}} most fundamental security considerations in distributed systems such as Grids. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), under which the users are assigned to certain roles while the roles are associated with prescribed permissions, remains one of the most popular <b>authorisation</b> control <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper presents a mechanism to theoretically compute the performance of running scientific workflows under RBAC authorisation control. Various performance metrics are calculated, including both system-oriented metrics, (such as system utilisation, throughput and mean response time) and user-oriented metrics (such as mean response time of the workflows submitted by a particular client). With this work, if a client informs an organisation of the workflows they are going to submit, the organisation is able to predict the performance of these workflows running in its local computational resources (e. g. a high-performance cluster) enforced with RBAC authorisation control, and can also report client-oriented performance to each individual user. ...|$|R
