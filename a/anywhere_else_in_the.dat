It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{more typical}} {{locations}} across the Mojave Desert, {{many of the}} water-dependent Death Valley habitats possess a diversity {{of plant and animal}} species that are not found <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated {{in the development of}} acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Dean in Mexico were {{more severe than}} <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm's path. Hurricane Dean, the most intense storm of the 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The Cape Verde-type hurricane sped through the Caribbean Sea, rapidly intensifying before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Accurate forecasts of the storm's location and intensity enabled thorough preparations; nevertheless when the massive storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as a catastrophic Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale it damaged thousands of homes.|$|E

5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but finds that the animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He finds that the people, {{under the guidance of}} missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|In September 1183, {{construction}} of the Cairo Citadel began under Saladin's orders. According to al-Maqrizi, Saladin chose the Muqattam Hills to build the citadel because the air there was fresher than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, but its construction {{was not so much}} determined by the salubrious atmosphere; rather it was out of defensive necessity and example of existing fortresses and citadels in Syria. The walls and towers of the northern section of the citadel are largely the works of Saladin and al-Kamil. Two of Saladin's towers were totally encased by semi-circular units. Al-Kamil completed the citadel; he strengthened and enlarged some of the existing towers, and also added a number of square towers which served as self-contained keeps. According to Richard Yeomans, the most impressive of al-Kamil's structures was the series of massive rectangular keeps which straddled the walls of the northern enclosure. All of al-Kamil's fortifications can be identified by their embossed, rusticated masonry, whereas Saladin's towers have smooth dressed stones. This heavier rustic style became a common feature in other Ayyubid fortifications, and {{can be seen in the}} Citadel of Damascus and that of Bosra in Syria.|$|E
25|$|Curicó Valley is {{planted with}} more grape {{varieties}} than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Chile, but <b>the</b> dominant varieties are Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc.

5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E
5|$|The Asian American {{population}} in the Bay Area is significant compared to other regions in the U.S., concentrated in the Bay Area city of Daly City. At 58.4%, Daly City's Asian American population is larger than <b>anywhere</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States outside of Hawaii. Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Fremont, with significant populations in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had {{the third and fourth}} largest total number of Asian Americans out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, South San Francisco and Vallejo. There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam. In addition, there is a sizable community of Korean Americans in Santa Clara county, where San Jose is located. East Bay cities such as Richmond and Oakland, and the North Bay city of Santa Rosa, have plentiful populations of Laotian and Cambodians in certain neighborhoods. Pacific Islanders such as Samoans and Tongans have the largest presence in East Palo Alto, where they constitute over 7% of the population.|$|E
