40|$|Abstract—As various {{enabling}} technologies advance, conformal phased arrays are finding more numerous applications. Because a conformal array is curved, new far field pattern behaviors emerge {{and many of}} the traditional linear and planar phased array syn-thesis methods are not valid. This paper starts by reviewing the equations for the far field of a curved phased array, and provides a generalized definition of <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> appropriate for con-formal arrays. A modified Bernstein polynomial, defined with just five parameters, is introduced which provides a flexible method to specify a variety of smooth unimodal amplitude distributions that are shown to give good sidelobe levels and <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> By using particle swarm optimization of the modified Bernstein polynomial parameters constrained to provide a specified <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> a family of aperture distributions and corresponding far field patterns is produced that allows <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> to be traded for sidelobe level.

50|$|In general, the {{aperture}} of an antenna {{is not directly}} related to its physical size. However some types of antennas, for example parabolic dishes and horns, have a physical aperture (opening) which collects the radio waves. In these aperture antennas, the effective aperture Aeff must always be less than the area of the antenna's physical aperture Aphys, as {{can be seen from the}} definition above. An antenna's <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency,</b> ea is defined as the ratio of these two areas:The <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1.0 that measures how close the antenna comes to using all the radio power entering its physical aperture. If the antenna were perfectly efficient, all the radio power falling within its physical aperture would be converted to electrical power delivered to the load attached to its output terminals, so these two areas would be equal Aeff = Aphys and the <b>aperture</b> <b>efficiency</b> would be 1.0. But all antennas have losses, such as power dissipated as heat in the resistance of its elements, nonuniform illumination by its feed, and radio waves scattered by structural supports and diffraction at {{the aperture}} edge, which reduce the power output. <b>Aperture</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of typical antennas vary from 0.35 to 0.70 but can range up to 0.90.|$|R

INTRODUCTION Triplate line fed arrays have been researched extensively over the last 10 years for DBS television subscriber antenna in Japan and Europe.
