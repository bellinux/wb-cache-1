Repairs were also made to the ship's machinery, boilers and electrical systems. The island was enlarged with an admiral's staff cabin and a radar workshop.

25|$|In a state heavily {{reliant on}} {{continuous}} supply of gas for industrial processing, manufacturing, residential use and electricity generation, the sudden loss of almost 35% of gas supply had immediate social impacts, and significant {{short and long-term}} economic effects. Many businesses were forced to curtail or cease operations, resulting in workers being stood down or forced to take annual leave, and the government requested that businesses and householders conserve energy usage. An emergency coordination committee of government and industry representatives rationed and redirected remaining gas supply sources. When many large gas users switched to diesel for power generation, {{the risk of a}} shortfall in transport fuel led to the federal government authorising the release of emergency fuel reserves stored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Island naval facility.|$|E

25|$|Around 1983, Saint Phalle {{decided to}} cover her Tarot Garden sculptures {{primarily}} in durable ceramic colored tiles, adding shards of mirrors and glass, and polished stones.

Starting in 1985, Jean Tinguely added motorized and stationary steel sculptures and fountains to the project. Robert Haligon and his sons did {{much of the work}} which involved polyester resins. Saint Phalle asked Pierre Marie Lejeune to create a cement path, which he inscribed with hieroglyphs, other signs and symbols, and text.
