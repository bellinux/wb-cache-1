5|$|Taborn prefers earlier {{models of}} Fender Rhodes, for their raunchier sound.

2500|$|<b>Amplifiers</b> can be {{categorized}} in different ways. One is by {{the frequency of the}} electronic signal being amplified. For example, audio <b>amplifiers</b> amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20kHz, RF <b>amplifiers</b> amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20kHz and 300GHz, and servo <b>amplifiers</b> and instrumentation <b>amplifiers</b> may work with very low frequencies down to direct current.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} physical mechanisms {{that can be}} used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical <b>amplifiers.</b> In doped fiber <b>amplifiers</b> and bulk lasers, stimulated emission in the <b>amplifier's</b> gain medium causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical <b>amplifiers</b> (SOAs), electron-hole recombination occurs. In Raman <b>amplifiers,</b> Raman scattering of incoming light with phonons in the lattice of the gain medium produces photons coherent with the incoming photons. Parametric <b>amplifiers</b> use parametric amplification.|$|R

5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external <b>amplifier</b> and speaker in a cabinet. The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ, using a six-pin cable.

5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power <b>amplifier</b> capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated <b>amplifier</b> delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher <b>amplifier</b> power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the <b>amplifier</b> power requirements.|$|E
40|$|Different {{wideband}} <b>amplifiers,</b> hybrid designs {{at lower}} frequencies, and monolithically integrated circuits (MMIC) at higher frequencies were designed, fabricated, and measured. These <b>amplifiers</b> are {{all based on}} AlGaN/GaN HEMT technology. The future applications for these types of <b>amplifiers</b> are mainly electronic warfare (EW) applications. Novel communication jammers and especially {{active electronically scanned array}} EW systems have a high demand for wideband high power <b>amplifiers.</b> The second application also needs high robust low noise <b>amplifiers</b> for its receive path. Output power levels of 38 W for hybrid <b>amplifiers</b> at lower frequencies up to 6 GHz and 15 W for the MMIC power <b>amplifiers</b> at higher frequencies are measured. With these building blocks, novel EW system approaches can be investigated...|$|R

5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in <b>amplifier</b> is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power <b>amplifier.</b> Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
