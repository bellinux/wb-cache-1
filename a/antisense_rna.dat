5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, {{but a few}} are activators of transcription. One way <b>antisense</b> <b>RNA</b> can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E
5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor <b>antisense</b> <b>RNA</b> injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this work, they coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by <b>antisense</b> <b>RNA</b> expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a key enzyme for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
40|$|Four <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs,</b> {{synthesized}} from cDNA clones coding for {{the four}} subunits of the acetylcholine receptor of Torpedo electroplaques, were used to study their effect on the expression of functional Torpedo acetylcholine receptors in Xenopus oocytes. All <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> inhibited the appearance of functional receptors in the oocyte's surface membrane for at least 1 week. This inhibition was specific because the <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> did not block {{the expression of the}} Cl- channels, also encoded by Torpedo electroplaque mRNA. Experiments with incomplete <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> and a synthetic oligonucleotide indicate that covering the ribosome binding site or the initiation codon in the mRNA is not a necessary requirement for efficient blocking. Thus, the use of <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> combined with the Xenopus oocyte system provides a novel approach to screen cDNA libraries for the genes coding for multisubunit neurotransmitter receptors...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} of bioinformatics and high throughput sequencing technology, discovery of regulatory noncoding RNAs in bacteria has been increased {{to a great}} extent. Based on this bandwagon, many studies searching for trans-acting small noncoding RNAs in streptococci have been performed intensively, especially in the important human pathogen, group A and B streptococci. However, studies for cis-encoded noncoding <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> in streptococci have been scarce. A recent study shows <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> are involved in virulence gene regulation in group B streptococcus, S. agalactiae.

25|$|Since many tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes are}} silenced by DNA methylation during carcinogenesis, {{there have been}} attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) is a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must {{be incorporated into the}} genome of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have {{led to the development of}} <b>antisense</b> <b>RNA</b> therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their mRNAs and preventing their translation. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.|$|E

40|$|Many Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes encode {{antisense}} transcripts, some {{of which}} are unstable and degraded by the exosome component Rrp 6. Loss of Rrp 6 results in the accumulation of long PHO 84 <b>antisense</b> (AS) <b>RNAs</b> and repression of sense transcription through PHO 84 promoter deacetylation. We used single-molecule resolution fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) to investigate antisense-mediated transcription regulation. We show that PHO 84 AS RNA acts as a bimodal switch, in which continuous, low-frequency antisense transcription represses sense expression within individual cells. Surprisingly, <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> do not accumulate at the PHO 84 gene but are exported to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, rather than stabilizing PHO 84 AS RNA, the loss of Rrp 6 favors its elongation by reducing early transcription termination by Nrd 1 -Nab 3 -Sen 1.

40|$|Abstract Background The use {{of small}} interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as genetic inhibitors of gene {{expression}} {{has been shown}} to be an effective way of studying gene function in mammalian cells. Recently, different DNA vectors for expression of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or co-expression of sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> have been developed that direct siRNA-mediated gene silencing. One expression cassette design that has been used to express long sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> in non-mammalian cell types is symmetric transcription using convergent promoters. However, convergent transcription as a way to generate functional siRNAs in mammalian cells has not been reported. This vector design permits the generation of expression constructs containing no repeat sequences, but capable of inducing RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated gene silencing. Results With the aim of simplifying the construction of RNAi expression vectors, we report on the production and application of a novel convergent promoter cassette capable of expressing sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs,</b> that form double-stranded RNA, and mediate gene silencing in mammalian cells. We use this cassette to inhibit the expression of both the EGFP transgene and the endogenous TP 53 gene. The gene silencing effect is Dicer-dependent and the level of gene inactivation achieved is comparable to that produced with synthetic siRNA. Furthermore, this expression system can be used for both short and long-term control of specific gene expression in mammalian cells. Conclusion The experiments performed in this study demonstrate that convergent transcription can be used in mammalian cells to invoke gene-specific silencing via RNAi. This method provides an alternative to expression of shRNAs and co-expression of sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> from independent cassettes or a divergent promoter. The main advantage of the present vector design is the potential to produce a functional siRNA expression cassette with no repeat sequences. Furthermore, the cassette design reported is ideal for both routine use in controlling specific gene expression and construction of randomised RNAi expression libraries for use in unbiased forward genetic selections. </p...|$|R

Intriguingly, this Gram-positive bacterium can survive and thrive under {{a wide range of}} different conditions, {{both inside and outside the}} human body. Here, we investigated the transcriptional adaptation of S. aureus HG 001, a derivative of strain NCTC 8325, across experimental conditions ranging from optimal growth in vitro to intracellular growth in host cells. These data establish an extensive repertoire of transcription units and non-coding RNAs, a classification of 1412 promoters according to their dependence on the RNA polymerase sigma factors SigA or SigB, and allow identification of new potential targets for several known transcription factors. In particular, this study revealed a relatively low abundance of <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> in S. aureus, where they overlap only 6 % of the coding genes, and only 19 <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> not co-transcribed with other genes were found. Promoter analysis and comparison with Bacillus subtilis links the small number of <b>antisense</b> <b>RNAs</b> to a less profound impact of alternative sigma factors in S. aureus. Furthermore, we revealed that Rho-dependent transcription termination suppresses pervasive antisense transcription, presumably originating from abundant spurious transcription initiation in this A + T-rich genome, which would otherwise affect expression of the overlapped genes. In summary, our study provides genome-wide information on transcriptional regulation and non-coding RNAs in S. aureus as well as new insights into the biological function of Rho and the implications of spurious transcription in bacteria...|$|R
