5|$|In November {{the army}} was {{evacuated}} from the Taman Peninsula and it joined the Transcaucasian Front (briefly known as the Caucasian Front after 30 December 1941). The army participated in the Kerch-Feodosiya landing operation in December 1941– January 1942 alongside the 44th Army. 51st Army was originally planned to be the Kerch arm of the assault, but delays caused by bad weather and a schedule change prompted by renewed German attacks on Sevastopol resulted in 51st Army troops being landed at Capes Sjuk and Chroni during the night of 26–27 December 1941. The 44th and 51st Armies then formed the Crimean Front under General Dmitri T. Kozlov, formally established on 28 January 1942, which hammered repeatedly at Von Manstein's Eleventh Army. On 1 February 1942, 51st Army comprised the 138th and 302nd Mountain Rifle Divisions, the 224th, 390th, and 396th Rifle Divisions, the 12th Rifle Brigade, 83rd Naval Infantry Brigade, 105th Separate Mountain Rifle Regiment, 55th Tank Brigade, 229th Separate Tank Battalion, artillery units, and other support units. A German offensive was launched <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> on 8 May 1942. Army commander Lieutenant General Vladimir Nikolayevich Lvov was killed by bomb fragments on 11 May while changing his command post. The offensive concluded around 18 May 1942 with the near complete destruction of Soviet defending forces, which Erickson attributes to bickering between Kozlov and the Front commissar, Lev Mekhlis, and a trail of incompetent actions. Three armies (44th, 47th, and 51st), 21 divisions, 176,000 men, 347 tanks, and nearly 3,500 guns were lost. The remains of the force were evacuated.|$|E

25|$|From January 1918, the German {{activity}} intensified. On the 2 March, {{a strong}} German attack was made against Chapigny and Neuve-Chapelle sectors, {{with a heavy}} artillery, gas, mortars and machine-gun fire preparation. At 5am, the Germans assaulted and took the Front Line, forcing the 4th Infantry Battalion to retreat to the Support Line. The Portuguese artillery reacted, launching about 1400 grenades <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> Line. A counterattack made by the 4th Battalion, supported by 12th and 17th battalions, terminated the German attack. In this action, the Portuguese incurred 146 casualties and the Germans over 200.|$|E

25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E
500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains. The caisson {{at the bottom}} was jacked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wall of the lift to seal it, and a door or gate was opened to allow the boat to float in. The caisson at the top was jacked {{against the back wall}} in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and a small amount of energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track. His jockey, Willie Lovell, explained {{that he needed to}} do very little to win: [...] "In the stretch, when I saw Easy Jet had it, I let him run his own race. All I had to do was just sit there and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E

2500|$|Awake bruxism {{is thought}} to be usually semivoluntary, and often {{associated}} with stress caused by family responsibilities or work pressures. Some suggest that in children, bruxism may occasionally represent a response to earache or teething. Awake bruxism usually involves clenching (sometimes the term [...] "awake clenching" [...] is used instead of awake bruxism), but also possibly grinding, and is often associated with other semivoluntary oral habits such as cheek biting, nail biting, chewing on a pen or pencil absent mindedly, or tongue thrusting (where the tongue is pushed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> teeth forcefully).|$|E

2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|E
2500|$|In most of {{the early}} typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper, pressed against {{the bottom of the}} platen, so the typist could not see the text as it was typed. [...] What was typed was not visible until a {{carriage}} return caused it to scroll into view. [...] The difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. This was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called [...] "visible typewriters" [...] which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> side of the platen, became standard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover-up}} – Covering up is {{the last}} opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches [...] "roll" [...] off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.|$|E

2500|$|The spoon brake, or plunger brake was {{probably}} the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre. Spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after {{the introduction of the}} pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle. The spoon brake consists of a pad (often leather) or metal shoe (possibly rubber faced), which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre. [...] These were almost always rod-operated by a right-hand lever. [...] In developing countries, a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters. [...] It consists of a spring-loaded flap attached {{to the back of the}} fork crown. [...] This is depressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> tyre by the rider's foot.|$|E
2500|$|During Kostov's {{trial for}} treason, [...] American Minister Heath was {{frequently}} {{mentioned as a}} contact of Kostov. He was blamed for Kostov's alleged plot to overthrow the Bulgarian government, and for using the American Legation as a center of espionage. [...] The United States responded to these charges by breaking diplomatic relations with Bulgaria on February 22. [...] Heath and the forty-three members of the U.S. legation boarded the Orient Express on February 23 and left for Turkey. The Bulgarian Government denounced the break in relations as a new stage in [...] "the fight of the American imperialists <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of peace and democracy." [...] Thereafter the Polish Embassy in Washington looked after Bulgarian interests in the United States, and the Swiss Embassy in Sofia protected American interests in Bulgaria.|$|E
2500|$|The locks {{form the}} second row, pushing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row during the scrum thereby {{providing}} {{much of the}} power and {{are commonly known as}} the engine room. They are almost always the tallest players on the team and are the primary targets when the ball is thrown in at line-outs. Locks must also have good catching and tackling ability. At the line-out, the locks are supported by teammates, allowing them to compete for the ball, either passing or tapping it to the scrumhalf or setting up a drive. In scrums, the two locks bind tightly together and put their heads between a prop and the hooker. They compete for the kick-offs and are involved in securing the ball in rucks and mauls. They commonly make short runs (otherwise known as [...] "crash balls").|$|E
