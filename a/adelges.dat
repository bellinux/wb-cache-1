25|$|The eastern {{spruce gall adelgid}} (<b>Adelges</b> abietis Linnaeus) is an {{introduced}} species that feeds only on spruce. At least in 1985, the species was found in Canada from Ontario eastward and in adjacent parts of the United States.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} parasites or predators of <b>Adelges</b> abietis. Specimen trees in gardens may be afforded {{a degree of}} protection by hanging up fat balls to encourage tits which will also feed on the adelgid gall formers.|$|E
25|$|The {{pineapple}} gall adelgid is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. Spruce gall aphid, eastern spruce pineapple gall <b>adelges</b> and {{eastern spruce gall aphid}} are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid, is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|E
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|E
2500|$|The Pineapple gall adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> abietis) {{is a type}} of conifer-feeding insect {{that forms}} pineapple-shaped plant galls on its host species, {{commonly}} Norway and Sitka spruce. The adelgids (genus <b>Adelges)</b> are pear-shaped, soft-bodied green insects with long antennae, closely related to the aphid. [...] "Adelges" [...] lays up to one hundred eggs at a time, one on each needle. <b>Adelges</b> abietis (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is one of the most}} common species; synonyms are A. gallarum-abietis, Chermes abietis and Sacciphantes abietis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species is}} {{currently}} {{threatened by the}} hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae), a sap-sucking bug accidentally introduced from East Asia to the United States in 1924, and first found in the native range of eastern hemlock in the late 1960s. The adelgid has spread very rapidly in southern parts of the range once becoming established, while its expansion northward is much slower. Virtually all the hemlocks in the southern Appalachian Mountains have seen infestations of the insect within the last five to seven years, with thousands of hectares of stands dying within the last two to three years. Attempts to save representative examples on {{both public and private}} lands are on-going. A project named [...] "Tsuga Search", funded by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is being conducted to save the largest and tallest remaining eastern hemlocks in the Park. It is through Tsuga Search that hemlocks have been found with trunk volumes of up to 44.8 mÂ³ within the Park, making it the largest eastern evergreen conifer, eclipsing in volume both eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda). The tree is currently listed as a least concern species in the IUCN Red List, but this is based largely on its wide distribution and because the adelgid populations have not reached the northern areas of its range.|$|E

5000|$|Balsam twig aphids (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark adelgid, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi), and the {{eastern spruce gall adelgid}} (<b>Adelges</b> abietis). Another serious pest are bagworms. These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, the damage caused by the silk of bagworms can last years.|$|E
50|$|Norway and Sitka spruce {{are prone}} to the {{formation}} of Pineapple gall pseudocones caused by the woolly aphid, <b>Adelges</b> abietis. These are not cones, although they closely resemble them.|$|E
50|$|The hemlock woolly adelgid <b>Adelges</b> tsugae, an adelgid {{introduced}} to the United States from Asia in 1924, threatens Carolina hemlock, which is as susceptible as the related eastern hemlock.|$|E

50|$|Laricobius osakensis is {{a species}} of Derodontid beetle native to Japan. Described in 2011, it feeds {{exclusively}} on hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae), an invasive insect species that is destroying huge numbers of hemlock trees in eastern North America. It has shown promise as a biological control agent in field trials.|$|E
50|$|These forests have {{suffered}} recent declines due to infestations by the balsam woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> piceae), a non-native insect that originated in Europe. It first infested Mount Rogers in 1962 {{and the entire}} U.S. population of Fraser firs suffered a 67% mortality rate since, although Mount Rogers was not affected as severely as other locations.|$|E
50|$|When {{blue-headed}} vireos {{arrive on}} their breeding grounds, typically in mid-April, many deciduous trees {{have yet to}} leaf out, leading them to nest in evergreen trees including hemlocks. Recently, however, many hemlocks {{have been killed by}} an invasive Asian insect, the Hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae), leaving the vireos with fewer nesting options until the deciduous trees begin to leaf out.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is one of}} four genera in the family. While {{the other}} three feed on fungi, Laricobius species feed on adelgids, tiny insects very similar to aphids. Some adelgids are {{destructive}} forest pests, and Laricobius beetles have been employed as agents of biological pest control to prey on them and reduce their populations. An example is Laricobius nigrinus, which is released in forests to control the hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae).|$|E
50|$|The {{widespread}} {{death of}} Fraser fir trees has destroyed many habitats for the spiders, {{and they were}} listed as endangered in 1995. Many Fraser firs have died due to infestation with <b>Adelges</b> piceae, the balsam woolly adelgid, an insect pest introduced from Europe. The resulting thinning of the forest canopy leads to the drying of the moss mats that are essential for the spider's survival, as it requires climates of high and constant humidity.|$|E

The âTobacco Laboratory,â (now simply the Valley Laboratory) building was completed in 1941. Today, research covers areas such as the production of biofuel crops, invasive plant management, developing integrated pest management (IPM) methods for Connecticut nurseries, and management of the exotic hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae).|$|E
50|$|The {{pineapple}} gall adelgid is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. Spruce gall aphid, eastern spruce pineapple gall <b>adelges</b> and {{eastern spruce gall aphid}} are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae.

This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|E
5000|$|The red-cheeked {{salamander}} {{is listed}} as being [...] "Near Threatened" [...] in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The population of the species appears to be stable but the area of its range is less than 5000 km2. Balancing this, it is common in many locations, tolerates forestry disturbance and lives completely {{within the confines of}} the national park. The main threats may be acid rain, climate change and the damage to forests caused by the balsam woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> piceae).|$|E
50|$|Abies fraseri is {{severely}} damaged by a non-native insect, the balsam woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> piceae). The insect's introduction and spread {{led to a}} rapid decline in Fraser fir across its range, with over 80 percent of mature trees having been killed. The rapid regeneration of seedlings with lack of canopy has led to good regrowth of healthy young trees where the mature forests once stood. However, when these young trees get old enough for the bark to develop fissures, they may be attacked and killed by the adelgids as well.|$|E
50|$|The conifer species {{used and}} {{cultivated}} as Christmas trees {{are vulnerable to}} dozens of different pests, most of which cause cosmetic damage to the trees, important in the Christmas tree industry. The balsam woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> picae) are small soft-bodied insects which attack the Fraser fir. The insects appear as white, woolly spots on the tree and are fatal to the fir if left untreated. The woolly adeligid was native to central Europe where it affected the silver fir; it {{was introduced to the}} United States, where it has no known native predators, before 1900.|$|E
50|$|The two eastern North American species, T. canadensis and T. caroliniana, {{are under}} serious threat by the sap-sucking insect <b>Adelges</b> tsugae (hemlock woolly adelgid). This adelgid, {{related to the}} aphids, was {{introduced}} accidentally from eastern Asia, where {{it is only a}} minor pest. Extensive mortality has occurred, particularly east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Asian species are resistant to this pest, and the two western American hemlocks are moderately resistant. In North America, hemlocks are also attacked by hemlock looper. Larger infected hemlocks have large, relatively high root systems that can bring other trees down if one falls. The foliage of young trees is often browsed by deer, and the seeds are eaten by finches and small rodents.|$|E
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} also used by the woolly conifer aphid <b>Adelges</b> cooleyi; this 0.5 mm long sap-sucking insect is {{conspicuous}} on the undersides of the leaves by the small white [...] "fluff spots" [...] of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage in causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on Pseudotsuga in general (see there) the gelechiid moths Chionodes abella and C. periculella {{as well as the}} cone scale-eating tortrix moth Cydia illutana have been recorded specifically on P. menziesii.|$|E
50|$|The forests {{have been}} altered by logging and {{clearance}} for agriculture, urban and industrial development (including mining) with only small patches of original forest remaining, {{the largest of}} {{which is in the}} Great Smoky Mountains; nearly all of Shenandoah National Park, for example, is regrown forest but still vital habitat for wildlife. The spruce and fir forests of the highlands have been logged particularly intensively and in many cases have not regenerated leaving areas of Appalachian balds heath. Also, as large predators such as wolves and cougars have been removed, the forests are now being overgrazed by deer. Plants and animals are also threatened by introduced species including the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana), hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae), balsam woolly adelgid (A. piceae) and the Discula destructiva that affects dogwoods and is similar to chestnut blight.|$|E
50|$|Hemlock woolly adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> tsugae), or HWA, is {{member of}} the Sternorrhyncha {{suborder}} of the Order Hemiptera and native to East Asia. It feeds by sucking sap from hemlock and spruce trees (Tsuga spp.; Picea spp.). In eastern North America, it is a destructive pest that gravely threatens the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and the Carolina hemlock (Tsuga caroliniana). Though the range of eastern hemlock extends north of the current range of the adelgid, it could spread to infect these northern areas as well. Accidentally introduced to North America from Japan, HWA was first found in the eastern United States near Richmond, Virginia, in the early 1950s. The pest has now been established in eighteen eastern states from Georgia to Massachusetts, causing widespread mortality of hemlock trees. As of 2015, 90% of the geographic range of eastern hemlock in North America has been impacted by HWA.|$|E
50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{attacked}} by {{two species of}} <b>Adelges,</b> an aphid-like insect that causes galls to form. Nymphs of the pineapple gall adelgid form galls {{at the base of}} twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the Cooley's spruce gall adelgid cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the spruce budworm eat the buds and growing shoots while the spruce needle miner hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white scale insect, the pine needle scale feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles. Another insect pest is the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) which bores under the bark. It often first attacks trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby standing trees.|$|E
50|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), spruce gall adelgid (<b>Adelges</b> cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius).
