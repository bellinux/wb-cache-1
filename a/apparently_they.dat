5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> could not move fast enough to outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of traction poles in {{the centre of}} the road came before the April committee meeting, as <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> were becoming troublesome. It was decided to replace them by side poles and brackets, or side poles and span wires, as the opportunity occurred.|$|E
25|$|Isaac de Forcade, Seigneur de Biaix, Jurat of {{the city}} of Pau, and Pierre de Forcade, Seigneur de Baure, from Orthez, were both summoned to produce proof of their nobility to the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>they</b> were both {{maintained}} in their nobility because both they and their descendants continued carrying noble titles.|$|E

25|$|When the French {{captured}} British vessels {{they tried}} to get sailors, marines, {{and in the case of}} EIC ships, lascars, to join the French Navy. <b>Apparently</b> <b>they</b> generally had some success, particularly with Irishmen and lascars. However, in the case of Aurora, her marine detachment of 16 or 17 sepoys, recruited from among the Concanny Purwarries and serving in the Marine Battalion of the Bombay Marine, were steadfast in resisting first blandishments and then harsh treatment.|$|E
25|$|Before she {{can pursue}} this further, she {{is put in}} a Time Transfer box and sent Back Way Back, or in more usual terms, to about 150,000 BCE. She is left on Santa Catalina itself, still forested rather than the barren island of later millennia. Her job is to raise food for a Company resort on Santa Cruz Island, where rich folks come back to hobnob with mastodons and hunt saber-tooths, or maybe vice versa. Her memory has been {{interfered}} with, so she can no longer remember details of the history she once knew. She also has a mission to alert the Company when certain unusual beings show up to colonize {{the center of the}} island. <b>Apparently</b> <b>they</b> have something the Company needs....|$|E
25|$|The Patriots defense {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} Colts in the second quarter. On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Law intercepted a pass from Manning and returned it six yards to the 41-yard line. The Patriots then drove 52 yards and increased their lead to 13–0 with a second Vinatieri field goal. Brady completed three passes for 42 yards on the drive, including a 17-yarder to Givens and a 16-yard completion to Troy Brown on fourth down and 8. For {{the first time in}} the entire postseason, the Colts were forced to punt on their next drive. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>they</b> were very out of practice, because the snap from center Justin Snow sailed over the head of punter Hunter Smith. The ball went into the end zone, and Smith was forced to knock it out of bounds for a safety, making the score 15–0.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, {{coinciding with}} the release of the film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows [...] Part 1, a series of {{articles}} were written about Private Harry Potter of the British army. This real-life Harry Potter was killed in the Arab Revolt near Hebron in 1939. His grave, located in the British cemetery in Ramla, Israel, began to receive curious visitors leading the Ramla Municipality to list it on their website. The Daily Mail interviewed siblings of Harry Potter who stated, [...] "We couldn't believe people visit his grave, but <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> come from miles around to have their photo taken next to it." ...|$|E

[...] "What stood out in my mind {{was the fact that}} he allowed us to stretch out," [...] recalls Berliner. [...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
500|$|Following his injury, he was {{approached}} {{to play for}} Scotland by national manager Craig Brown. Johnson agreed to pledge his international future to Scotland in October 1999, {{but he was not}} selected for Scotland's Euro 2000 play-off against England. However, before he could be selected for any Scotland matches, it was revealed that due to an agreement made between the Home Nations in 1993, Johnson would not be eligible to play for any Home Nation other than England, as his mother is from Birmingham. Although Johnson met the terms required by FIFA to play internationally for Scotland, he did not meet the terms of the agreement set out in 1993. Speaking in January 2000, Scotland coach Craig Brown said: [...] "I was assuming that FIFA were aware of our home countries agreement and <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> weren't....but there was the agreement with the four nations." ...|$|E

500|$|The group's {{position}} in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. <b>Apparently</b> <b>they</b> expressed their opinion of us with their legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on your poor souls!" ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of November the British Royal Family were so {{interested}} in the story that they sent St.André and Samuel Molyneux, secretary to the Prince of Wales, to investigate. [...] <b>Apparently,</b> <b>they</b> were not disappointed; arriving on 15November they were taken by Howard to see Toft, who within hours delivered a rabbit's torso. [...] St.André's account details his examination of the rabbit. [...] To check if it had breathed air, he placed a piece of its lung in water {{to see if it}} would float—which it did. [...] St.André then performed a medical examination on Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her Fallopian tubes. [...] In the doctors' absence, Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit, which the two also examined. [...] They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent contractions. [...] A further medical examination followed, and St.André delivered some rabbit skin, followed a few minutes later by a rabbit's head. [...] Both men inspected the egested pieces of flesh, noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{order of}} battle of French forces is not clear, but {{contemporary}} sources suggest {{the presence of a}} portion of General Claude Lecourbe's Corps of 28,368, including the forces of generals Laval, Molitor, Jardon, and Vandamme. [...] This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the London Chronicle, 10 June 1800. [...] "The 6th Chasseurs, 13th Cavalry, 4th Hussars and 11th Chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair. [...] The rest of the division, and that of , passed rapidly [...] the Danube...General Grenier was equally well prepared." [...] In addition, the presence (and death) of Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, the First Grenadier of France, suggests that the grenadier company of the 46th Demi-brigade infantry de ligne was at least engaged. [...] In addition, General Espagne's 37th and 84th Regiments were engaged, as were grenadiers the 109th Regiment. [...] Lecourbe mentions the 37th and the 109th several times in his own account of the battle, so <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> were heavily engaged: this would include the brigades of François Goullus and François Bontemps.|$|E

500|$|On May 11, Governor Baxter {{asked the}} General Assembly {{to meet in}} special session, which they did. <b>Apparently,</b> <b>they</b> met [...] "behind Baxter lines" [...] {{although}} where that was isn't exactly clear. Since the Speaker of the House and President pro tempore of the Senate were both absent, being that they were both Brooks supporters, they were replaced. J.G. Frierson was elected President pro tempore of the Senate and James H. Berry Speaker of the House. They then passed an act calling for a constitutional convention, which Governor Baxter approved on May 18. The act scheduled an election for {{the last day of}} June and appointed delegates from the counties of Arkansas. Two days later, Generals Newton and Fagan negotiated an armistice. At the same time, the Arkansas Supreme Court had finally decided to hear the Brooks case, and voted three to one in favor of Baxter's election, further solidifying the Grant proclamation and Baxter as governor. The bar of the Pulaski County Circuit court also met and issued a resolution that stated that Judge Wytock had acted independently, and his decision did not represent the court. The trial had been deliberately unfair for the defendant Baxter, and the Supreme Court had already ruled that, under the state constitution, the court had no jurisdiction. They rendered Judge Wytock's decision null and void.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the break}} of dawn on 18 September (03:45), three Austrian columns {{attacked}} Kehl. The principal column, comprising the Regiment Ferdinand, crossed the Kinzig river above the French position and proceeded toward the dykes of the Rhine above Kehl. This placed them between Scherb and his force, and Kehl. Using the dykes as protection, and guided by some peasants {{who had been}} previously employed in strengthening the Kehl defenses, they advanced {{as far as the}} horn work on the Upper Rhine and entered a gorge which led them to the outskirts of the village. [...] The second column of the Regiment Ferdinand, under command of Major Busch, proceeded via Sundheim toward Kehl, and obtained possession of the village itself, although not the bridge leading to Strasbourg. The third column, which included three companies of Serbians and a division of hussars, executed a false feint on the left bank of the river. One corps of reserve under command of Colonel Pongratz, approached as far as the French earthworks {{on the banks of the}} Rhine to support the columns ahead of him; another, which included a battalion of the 12th Regiment, moved past the hamlet of Neumuhl (...) toward Kehl. Quickly, the Austrians possessed all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached one side of the abutment of the old palisade bridge and advanced to the other side, crossing the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. They halted almost under the eyes of the French sentinels; there is some confusion about why they stopped, but <b>apparently</b> <b>they</b> mistook the abutment for the last bridge itself.|$|E
