5|$|In its 2006 in Review issue (February 2007), Revolver {{magazine}} dubbed Christian metal {{the phenomenon}} of the year. Editor in Chief Tom Beaujour interviewed the lead vocalists of As I Lay Dying, Demon Hunter, Norma Jean, and Underoath (Tim Lambesis, Ryan Clark, Cory Brandan Putman, and Spencer Chamberlain, respectively) as the front-page article for the issue. Tooth <b>and</b> <b>Nail</b> Records, P.O.D., Zao, War of Ages, Still Remains, and He Is Legend were also mentioned.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and other manufacturing restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E

The high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module. During the Volt development the lithium-ion battery pack was subjected to a wide range of tests, including overcharge, discharge, vibration, excessive heat and cold, short circuit, humidity, fire, crush, water immersion, salt water immersion, <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> penetration.|$|E
40|$|The {{fluoride}} {{content in}} the urine, hair, <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> of 106 workers employed in a phosphate fertiliser plant was significantly raised above the control level.

Individual values in the whole population gave significant correlations between concentrations in urine <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> (r = 0. 73). The obtained results indicate that the fluoride content in hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> may be used as an indicator of occupational exposure to fluorides...|$|R

5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead a symptom of the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. Some manufacturers of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Excavations in the 1990s {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a linear settlement, stretching along the Fosse Way for perhaps a kilometre, comprising cobbled streets, wooden and stone workshops and houses (some with two storeys) containing hearths and ovens, industrial areas, and a stone-lined well. A great many artefacts were found, including local and imported pottery (such as samian ware), items of jewellery such as brooches, rings and bracelets, toilet items including tweezers, ear scoops <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> cleaners, bronze and iron tools, and a lead ingot which probably originated from the Roman lead mines on the Mendip Hills. Coins minted across the Roman empire were also found. The finds on the site indicate occupation from the late-1st or early-2nd centuries to the late-4th or early-5th centuries. As no public buildings were found, the settlement was probably not a town.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{possibility}} of determining atenolol in hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> {{is presented in}} our study. The capability to analyse these biologicalmaterials opens up newpossi-bilities {{in the field of}} clinical-toxicological examinations, especially forensic toxicol-ogy. Products of the epidermis, such as hair <b>and</b> <b>nails,</b> can constitute good biological material for use in toxicological examinations; samples can be taken from living per-sons, and post-mortem and also from persons who have stopped taking the drug a long time before. Liquid chromatography with a mass detector was used for the in-vestigation. A method of isolation and identification of atenolol from hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> was worked out during the study. Validation of the method was carried out. The de-velopedmethodwas used to determine the level of atenolol in hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> obtained from people who take this medicine. The developed analytical conditions enable de-termination of the medicine at levels higher than 25 pg/mg. 30 samples of hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> (obtained from people who had been taking atenolol for a period of over 6 months) were analysed. The concentration of atenolol in hair was, on average, 1. 73 ng/ml <b>and</b> in <b>nails</b> – 0. 155 ng/ml...|$|R

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 173, the Iazyges {{launched}} a raid across the frozen Danube, but the Romans were ready for pursuit and followed {{them back to the}} Danube. The Iazyges prepared an ambush, planning to attack and scatter them as they tried to cross the frozen Danube, knowing that the Roman legionaries were not trained to fight on ice, and that their own horses had been trained to fight on ice without slipping. However the Roman army formed a solid square and dug into the ice with their shields, so that they would not slip. When the Iazyges could not break the Roman lines, the Romans counterattacked, pulling the Iazyges off of their horses by grabbing on to their spears, clothing and shields. Soon both armies were in disarray after having slipped on the ice, and the battle was reduced to many brawls between the two sides, literally tooth <b>and</b> <b>nail</b> battles, which the Romans won. After this battle the Iazyges, and presumably the Sarmatians in general, were declared the primary enemy of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the furnace. With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron <b>and</b> <b>Nail</b> Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E

40|$|Scalp {{hair and}} {{fingernail}} samples of 42 medical radiographers and 42 nonradiographers (control) with matching age groups and food habits were collected for this study. Trace metal estimation by {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (AAS) has indicated a significant increase (P < 0. 001) in Zn, Cu, and Cd contents in the radiographers' hair <b>and</b> <b>nails.</b> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveled structural changes in the hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> of radiographers. Significant alterations in the Zn and Cd contents along with extensive structural damage in the hair <b>and</b> <b>nails</b> probably indicate that low-dose X-radiation imposes stress on these radiation workers...|$|R
