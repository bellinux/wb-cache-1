5|$|Innis did his {{postgraduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago and {{was awarded}} his PhD, with a dissertation {{on the history of}} Canadian Pacific Railway, in August 1920. His two years <b>at</b> <b>Chicago</b> had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty <b>at</b> <b>Chicago</b> questioned abstract and universalist neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, gales {{from the}} former {{hurricane}} swept across the Great Lakes. Hundreds of spectators lined the shores of Lake Michigan <b>at</b> <b>Chicago,</b> Illinois, to watch the enormous waves. A schooner was torn from its moorings <b>at</b> <b>Chicago,</b> and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first mate, and cook were safely rescued. The storm damaged around $75,000 worth of property on the Great Lakes.|$|E

5|$|Granderson was {{recruited}} {{by a number}} of college baseball programs, and he chose the University of Illinois <b>at</b> <b>Chicago</b> (UIC), in part because they allowed him to play basketball in addition to baseball. However, Granderson quit basketball two weeks into his freshman year in order to concentrate on baseball.|$|E

5|$|After Jordan retired {{following}} the 1992–93 NBA season, Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago Bulls Vice President Steve Schanwald seek proposals from artists. Twelve artists made proposals.

5|$|After Sagan recuperated, {{she lived}} in Paris for a time with her godfather, {{attending}} the Sorbonne. In 1951, she emigrated to the US to study at the University of Illinois <b>at</b> <b>Chicago,</b> majoring in child development. While there, she met Leonard Sagan, then a young medical student. The couple were married the following year, and would remain together until Leonard's death in 1997. Following their marriage, the pair moved to Washington, D.C. for Leonard's work. Sagan also worked part-time teaching cooking classes to the wives of US Congressmen.|$|E
5|$|After the 1932 season, University of Chicago {{president}} Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchins {{forced out}} 70-year-old head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, whom he considered {{too old for}} the position. Stagg {{then moved on to}} coach at the College of the Pacific. Athletic director T. Nelson Metcalf hired Shaughnessy to replace Stagg as head coach in 1933. Shaughnessy inherited a difficult situation <b>at</b> <b>Chicago,</b> and for the most part, lacked good material. He did, however, inherit from Stagg at least one important recruit: inaugural Heisman Trophy winner and future Hall of Fame back Jay Berwanger, whom many Midwest pundits considered the best back of the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Compton, the {{chairman}} of the University of Chicago physics department, coordinated the uranium research of Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, Berkeley. To remove disagreement and duplication, Compton transferred the scientists to the Metallurgical Laboratory <b>at</b> <b>Chicago.</b> Teller was left behind at first, because while he and Mici were now American citizens, they still had relatives in enemy countries. In early 1943, the Los Alamos laboratory was established in Los Alamos, New Mexico to design an atomic bomb, with Oppenheimer as its director. Teller moved there in March 1943. Apparently, Teller managed to annoy his neighbors there by playing the piano late in the night.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, as a {{graduate}} student <b>at</b> <b>Chicago,</b> he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist Albert A. Michelson. Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of Geiger counter tubes arranged as a cosmic ray telescope, and under the aegis of his faculty advisor Arthur Compton, conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called East–West effect of cosmic rays. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the Physical Review, with Alvarez's name at the top.|$|E
