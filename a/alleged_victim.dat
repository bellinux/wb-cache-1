On March 18, 2004, Love was arrested in New York City for allegedly striking a 24-year-old male fan with a microphone stand at a concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Four days later, on March 22, Love called in multiple times to The Howard Stern Show, making various claims and speaking erratically; in broadcast conversations with Stern, she claimed that the incident with the fan had not occurred, and that actress Natasha Lyonne, who was at the concert, was told by the <b>alleged</b> <b>victim</b> that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest.

25|$|In May 2010, the PRC {{authorities}} officially passed {{new regulations}} {{in an attempt}} to nullify evidence gathered through violence or intimidation in their official judicial procedures, and to reduce the level of torture administered to prisoners already in jails. Little is known, however, about whether or how procedures were modified in black jails, which are not officially part of the judicial system. The move came after a public outcry following the revelation that a farmer, convicted for murder based on his confession under torture, was in fact innocent. The case came to light only when his <b>alleged</b> <b>victim</b> was found alive, after the defendant had spent ten years in prison. International human rights groups gave the change a cautious welcome.|$|E
25|$|According to AI, on June 16, a {{military}} tribunal sentenced Fernando Kutino and two colleagues to 20 years following a brief trial.

The court changed the charge to illegal possession of firearms, criminal conspiracy, and attempted murder (although the <b>alleged</b> <b>victim</b> refused to implicate Kutino). AI claimed that the court used evidence extracted from Kutino's codefendants under torture, and defense lawyers walked out nine days before the guilty verdict to protest {{the conduct of the}} trial.

25|$|Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean {{from the}} BBC {{programme}} Newsnight began to investigate {{reports that he}} had sexually abused children. They interviewed one <b>alleged</b> <b>victim</b> on camera and talked {{to a number of}} others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight {{was in a position to}} break the story in 2011.

I find it creepy and perverse that Parker and Celestin would put a fictional rape at the center of their film, and that Parker would portray himself as a hero avenging that rape.
