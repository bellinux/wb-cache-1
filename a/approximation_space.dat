50|$|The {{extended}} {{finite element}} method (XFEM) is a numerical technique based on the generalized {{finite element method}} (GFEM) and the partition of unity method (PUM). It extends the classical finite element method by enriching the solution space for solutions to differential equations with discontinuous functions. Extended finite element methods enrich the <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> {{so that it is}} able to naturally reproduce the challenging feature associated with the problem of interest: the discontinuity, singularity, boundary layer, etc. It was shown that for some problems, such an embedding of the problem's feature into the <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> can significantly improve convergence rates and accuracy. Moreover, treating problems with discontinuities with XFEMs suppresses the need to mesh and remesh the discontinuity surfaces, thus alleviating the computational costs and projection errors associated with conventional finite element methods, at the cost of restricting the discontinuities to mesh edges.|$|E

The first projection method is a generalization of the classical primal-dual method {{to the case of}} vector-valued variables of interest. We highlight the role played by three reduced spaces: the <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> and the test space associated to the primal variable, and the <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> associated to the dual variable. Then we propose a Petrov-Galerkin projection method based on a saddle point problem involving an <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> for the primal variable and an <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> for an auxiliary variable. A goal-oriented choice of the latter space, defined as the sum of two spaces, allows us to improve the approximation of the variable of interest compared to a primal-dual method using the same reduced spaces. Then, for both approaches, we derive computable error estimates for the approximations of the variable of interest and we propose greedy algorithms for the goal-oriented construction of reduced spaces. The performance of the algorithms are illustrated on numerical examples and compared to standard (non goal-oriented) algorithms...|$|E

40|$|A {{fuzzy set}} can be {{represented}} by a family of crisp sets using its α-level sets, whereas a rough set {{can be represented}} by three crisp sets.

The rough-fuzzy-set and fuzzy-rough-set models are analyzed, with emphasis on their structures in terms of crisp sets. A rough fuzzy set {{is a pair of}} fuzzy sets resulting from the approximation of a fuzzy set in a crisp <b>approximation</b> <b>space,</b> and a fuzzy rough set is a pair of fuzzy sets resulting from the approximation of a crisp set in a fuzzy <b>approximation</b> <b>space.</b> The approximation of a fuzzy set in a fuzzy <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> leads to a more general framework.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} high-fidelity surface {{approximation}} technique that aims at a faithful reconstruction of piecewise-smooth surfaces from a scattered point set. The presented method builds on the Moving Least-Squares (MLS) projection methodology, but introduces a fundamental modification: While the classical MLS uses a fixed <b>approximation</b> <b>space,</b> i. e., polynomials of a certain degree, the new method is data-dependent. For each projected point, it finds a proper local <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> of piecewise polynomials (splines). The locally constructed spline encapsulates the local singularities which may exist in the data. The optional singularity for this local <b>approximation</b> <b>space</b> is modeled via a Singularity Indicator Field (SIF) which is computed over the input data points.

40|$|Linear {{reinforcement}} learning (RL) algorithms like least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD) require basis functions that span <b>approximation</b> <b>spaces</b> of potential value functions. This article investigates methods to construct these bases from samples. We hypothesize that an ideal <b>approximation</b> <b>spaces</b> should encode diffusion distances and that slow feature analysis (SFA) constructs such spaces. To validate our hypothesis we provide theoretical {{statements about the}} LSTD value approximation error and induced metric of <b>approximation</b> <b>spaces</b> constructed by SFA and the state-of-the-art methods Krylov bases and proto-value functions (PVF). In particular, we prove that SFA minimizes the average (over all tasks in the same environment) bound on the above approximation error.

Finally, the LSTD and least squares policy iteration (LSPI) performance of <b>approximation</b> <b>spaces</b> constructed by Krylov bases, PVF, SFA and PCA is compared in benchmark tasks and a visual robot navigation experiment (both in a realistic simulation and with a robot).
