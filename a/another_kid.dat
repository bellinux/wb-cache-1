500|$|According to Gough, Justin Hartley was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to play the}} role of Oliver Queen, and his alter ego Green Arrow. Oliver was {{designed}} to provide an alternative view for what it means to be a hero. At the same time, the producers wanted a character that could impact the lives of both Clark and Lois. The actor is also the first to portray Oliver Queen/Green Arrow in any live-action media. Hartley believed that it was the season six episode [...] "Reunion" [...] that really helped him to understand his character. In the episode, it is revealed that Oliver was [...] "a jerk to Lex" [...] when the two were at school together, and after <b>another</b> <b>kid</b> falls into a coma because of Oliver and Lex's actions, Oliver decides to start a new path for himself. According to Hartley, this allowed the actor to [...] "justify why someone would put their life in danger every night and have such strong feelings about going out and being this social advocate". Hartley was a recurring guest in the sixth and seventh seasons, but became a series regular in season eight.|$|E

He liked {{the words to}} other people's songs but sometimes the rhythms were [...] "kind of boggy," [...] and he might change them. One night he delivered some hits composed by his friend, George M. Cohan, <b>another</b> <b>kid</b> who was getting known on Broadway with his own songs. When Berlin ended with Cohan's [...] "Yankee Doodle Boy," [...] notes Whitcomb, [...] "everybody in the joint applauded the feisty little fellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Paige, his {{nickname}} originated from childhood work toting bags {{at the train}} station. He {{said he was not}} making enough money at a dime a bag, so he used a pole and rope to build a contraption that allowed him to cart up to four bags at once. <b>Another</b> <b>kid</b> supposedly yelled, [...] "You look like a walking satchel tree." [...] A different story was told by boyhood friend and neighbor, Wilber Hines, who said he gave Paige the nickname after he was caught trying to steal a bag. At the age of ten, Satchel was playing [...] "top ball" [...] which was what got him into baseball. [...] "Top ball" [...] was a kids' game that used sticks and bottle caps instead of baseballs and bats to play a variation of the diamond sport. Satchel's mother, Lula, would even comment on how Satchel would rather [...] "play baseball than eat. It was always baseball, baseball." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{noted that}} Rowling admires Roddy Doyle and Jane Austen, saying [...] "both of whom write about class distinctions," [...] {{and asked if}} the reason Rowling wrote about class was a {{conscious}} decision. Rowling replied, [...] "kids are acutely aware of money—before they're aware of class. A kid isn't really going to notice how <b>another</b> <b>kid</b> holds his knife and fork. But a kid will be acutely aware that he doesn't have pocket money. Or that he doesn't have as much pocket money. I think back to myself at 11. Kids can be mean, very mean. So it was there in Ron not having the proper length robes, you know? And {{not being able to}} buy stuff on the trolley. He's got to have sandwiches his mum made for him, even though he doesn't like the sandwiches. Having enough money to fit in is an important facet of life—and what is more conformist than a school?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Drunken {{men are the}} especial prey of the road-kids. Robbing {{a drunken}} man they call [...] "rolling a stiff"; and {{wherever}} they are, {{they are on the}} constant lookout for drunks. The drunk is their particular meat, as the fly is the particular meat of the spider. The rolling of a stiff is ofttimes an amusing sight, especially when the stiff is helpless and when interference is unlikely. At the first swoop the stiff's money and jewellery go. Then the kids sit around their victim in a sort of pow-wow. A kid generates a fancy for the stiff's necktie. Off it comes. <b>Another</b> <b>kid</b> is after underclothes. Off they come, and a knife quickly abbreviates arms and legs. Friendly hoboes may be called in to take the coat and trousers, which are too large for the kids. And in the end they depart, leaving beside the stiff the heap of their discarded rags.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first she}} had been stolid, and {{affected}} utter ignorance as to how it got there, but Mr. Godfrey had entreated her as a friend to try to discover; and had with all his heart made a pathetic description of the girl (he durst not say lady) who {{had always been a}} mother to her little brother, and now had lost him, and was in terrible uncertainty as to his fate. That came home to Lizzie's feelings, and she let out what she had seen or picked up in the way of gossip,--that the ship had been left behind by its owner, whether boy or girl Liz was uncertain, for it had long fair hair, wore a petticoat, and had been dosed with gin and something else when carried away. They said it had made noise enough when brought there by Funny Frank and Julia. They were performing folk, who had come in after the Derby day to have a spree, and to pick up <b>another</b> <b>kid</b> to do fairies and such like, because the last they had had hurt his back and had to be left in the workhouse. Yes, she had heard tell that they had got the child from Mother Bet, of whom Gerard had a vague idea as one of the horrible hags, who not only beg themselves, but provide outfits for beggars, including infants, to excite compassion. Either she or one of her crew had picked up the child and disposed of his clothes; and then finding him too old and intelligent to be safely used for begging purposes, she had sold or hired him out to these acrobatic performers, who had gone off into that vague and unknown region, the country. Liz had no notion what was their real name, nor where they would go, only that they attended races and fairs; {{and as soon as the}} actual pleasure of communicating information was over, she was seized with a panic, implored Mr. Godfrey to make no use of her information, and explained that the people of the house were quite capable of killing her, if they suspected her of betraying any of their transactions. It was impossible to bring any authorities to bear on the quest; and Mr. Dutton held it wisest only to write a note telling Mr. Egremont that he had obtained evidence that the child was living, and that he was going in pursuit, but thought it safer to say no more at present. He gave the note to Mark at his office. 'I cannot trust myself to see your cousin,' he said. 'I might be tempted to say more than was consistent with Godfrey's honour towards his informant.' ...|$|E
