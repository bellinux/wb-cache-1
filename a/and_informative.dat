5|$|As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The {{group was}} defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than Allosaurus or Sinraptor by Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus in the carcharodontosaurid {{subfamily}} Giganotosaurinae based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and Stephen L. Brusatte united Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, and Tyrannotitan in the tribe Giganotosaurini. Giganotosaurus {{is one of the}} most complete <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> members of Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E

The benefits of the wartime alliances proved to be substantial, but required constant effort to maintain. For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA proved to be a formative <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> one, with many political and military lessons. Over the following decades, Australian, New Zealand and American forces would fight together again, in the Korean War, Vietnam War and the War on Terror.|$|E

25|$|In August 2014, the Cato Institute {{suggested}} that Congressional staffers should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel {{hosted by the}} institute endorsed the idea so that congressional staffers could use their time to write neutral <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia {{and the history of}} biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the staffers to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.|$|E
25|$|The Ms. Ludwig XV 13, also titled Fior di Battaglia, is {{currently}} in the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA. Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text are all {{very similar to the}} Ms. M.383, though it's largely free of silver enamel. The text takes the form of descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear <b>and</b> <b>informative.</b> Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, {{not the least of which}} is the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of Fior di Battaglia. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Getty version'.|$|E
25|$|Although this {{investigation}} was insightful <b>and</b> <b>informative,</b> the theory, along with others which hypothesized an appreciably increasing amount of seepage {{just prior to the}} failure, becomes less likely when it is compared against the eyewitness accounts of the conditions in the canyon and near the dam during the last thirty minutes before its collapse. Grunsky hypothesized, though failed to explain the action of the dam tilting as he described. This action would have the dam in motion as a singular unit while conversely, testimony given at the Coroner's Inquest indicates that the dam was fractured transversely in at least four places. Furthermore, the two cracks, which bordered each side of the standing center section, would have served as hinges to prevent this.|$|E

25|$|Robert Entman, {{professor}} of communication at the George Washington University and critic of mainstream media for decades, indicated {{it was a}} very wise tactic from the Pentagon. He mentioned there were more chances for the journalists to make favorable reports whilst in Iraq with British and American soldiers than if they had been asking questions in Washington. Entman indicated there is a natural cultural bias of American journalists in favor of military troops of their own country and that journalists do like to satisfy the government upon which they rely for information, as well as the public on whom they depend commercially. Entman also mentioned the high number of retired generals making comments on TV, pointing out these could not be considered independent experts as they were still paid by the government. He claims the British Broadcasting Corporation was much more neutral <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> on cultural and historical background than most American television reports.|$|E
25|$|Breakfast Time was {{the first}} BBC breakfast programme, with Ron Neil as producer. It was {{conceived}} {{in response to the}} plans of the commercial television company TV-am to introduce a breakfast television show. Breakfast Times first broadcast was on 17 January 1983 and was presented by Frank Bough, Selina Scott, Nick Ross and Russell Grant. The atmosphere of the set was intended to encourage a relaxed informality; a set that mimicked a living-room rather than a studio, with red leather sofas, and Bough and Ross wearing jumpers and open-necked shirts. This allowed for an unconventional mix of authoritative and highbrow news <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> and entertainment features that made the show dominate the new genre and trounce the anticipated threat by the star-name commercial TV rival. So, a senior government minister might be subjected to intense questioning while sitting on the red sofa, to be then included in the presentation of a food cooking demonstration. Breakfast Time lasted 150 minutes, initially being transmitted between 6.30 am and 9 ammoving to a 6.50 am to 9.20 am slot on 18 February 1985.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1960, {{with the}} arrival of the R27s, service on the Brighton Line was as follows: Express was {{designated}} as Q, local via tunnel as QT, and local via bridge as QB. Single letters were used to refer to express lines and double letters for local lines, a practice that began thirty years earlier with the Independent Subway System (IND). However, these designations were not as yet in common usage, and the R27 signs continued to display the old route names. For the above reasons and for the sake of continuity and consistency, these services were referred to by the old route names until the time of the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection. Moreover, it was deemed more important <b>and</b> <b>informative</b> to indicate how the trains actually operated rather than how the letters were manipulated. Starting January 1, 1961, weekday Brighton Express service terminated at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue all day. On Saturdays, these trains provided local service between Franklin Avenue and Brighton Beach. This service was merged into the Franklin Avenue Shuttle service on October 14, 1961, and was discontinued altogether in February 1963. (The Sunday service to Brighton Beach had been discontinued on January 1, 1961.) Brighton Local service ran to Astoria – Ditmars Boulevard at all times. On Saturdays, they provided express service on the Brighton Line, and ran local all other times. This service change was essentially a swap between the north terminals of the Brighton Local and Fourth Avenue Local, and between the Brighton Express and West End Express. Prior to this time, both Brighton services operated via the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. This change served to keep one Brighton service available in the event of a massive delay in the 60th Street Tunnel.|$|E
