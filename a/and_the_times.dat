5|$|According to Tarkovsky, the {{original}} idea for a film {{about the life of}} Andrei Rublev was due to the film actor Vasily Livanov. Livanov proposed to write a screenplay together with Tarkovsky and Konchalovsky while they were strolling through a forest on the outskirts of Moscow. He also mentioned that he would love to play Andrei Rublev. Tarkovsky did not intend the film to be a historical or a biographical film about Andrei Rublev. Instead, he was motivated by the idea of showing the connection between a creative character's personality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> through which he lives. He wanted to show an artist's maturing and the development of his talent. He chose Andrei Rublev for his importance in the history of Russian culture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an HIV- 1 {{infection}} {{model with}} distributed intracellular delays is investigated, where the intracellular delays account for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> target cells are contacted by <b>the</b> virus particles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> contacted cells become actively infected {{meaning that the}} contacting virions enter cells <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> virus has penetrated into a cell <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> new virions are created within <b>the</b> cell <b>and</b> are released from the cell, respectively. By analyzing the characteristic equations, the local stability of an infection-free equilibrium and a chronic-infection equilibrium of the model is established. By using suitable Lyapunov functionals and LaSalle’s invariance principle, it is proved that if the basic reproduction ratio is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; <b>and</b> if <b>the</b> basic reproduction ratio is greater than unity, the chronic-infection equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable...|$|R

5|$|Thompson still {{wished to}} leave Alaska, however, and in 1915, he sold a {{majority}} share of News-Miner stock on option to O.P. Gaustad, a Republican Party booster. Scandal erupted {{when it was}} revealed that Gaustad was merely a stand-in for James Wickersham, who was Alaska's delegate to Congress. Partially because of the scandal, Gaustad was unable to sell the shares he held an option for, and Thompson returned to Alaska in spring 1916 to reassume his role as publisher. Later that year, Republican interests took over the Fairbanks Times, which had leaned toward the Democratic Party.
