50|$|The main {{application}} of manganese tetrafluoride {{is in the}} purification of elemental fluorine. Fluorine gas is produced by electrolysis of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (with {{a small amount of}} potassium fluoride added as a support electrolyte) in a Moissan cell.

These contaminants are particularly problematic for the semiconductor industry, which uses high-purity fluorine for etching silicon wafers.

Hotta et al. synthesized poly(3-butylthiophene) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) electrochemically (and later chemically), and characterized the polymers in solution and cast into films.

40|$|The {{reactions}} of the group V pentafluorides with the oxides of nitrogen have been studied. Phosphorus pentafluoride does not react at room temperature with nitric oxide, and the only involatile product formed in the reaction of <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentafluoride</b> with nitric oxide is NOAsF 6. The other reactions yield complex mixtures of involatile solids, all of which contain nitrosoniurn and/or nitronium salts. Evidence is presented for the formation in these {{reactions of}} complex oxyfluoride species containing anions of general formula (MOF 4) - (M = P, As, Sb). The products formed in the reactions of antimony pentafluoride are more complex than those formed in the corresponding reactions of phosphorus and arsenic pentafluorides. The Sb 2 F 11 - anion is frequently formed, and in systems where the oxide of nitrogen reacts in the liquid phase, nitrito-or nitrato-fluorides can be isolated. Phosphorus trifluoride forms a stable l:l complex with antimony pentafluoride and an unstable complex with <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentafluoride.</b> Spectroscopic evidence suggests that these are ionic or fluorine- bridged species. The existence of a weak complex between antimony pentafluoride and carbon monoxide is also indicated. Ruthenium pentafluoride is reduced by carbon monoxide at 200 °C to a moisture-sensitive solid of composition Ru(CO) F 3. 5. Spectroscopic, magnetic and chemical evidence are consistent with a formulation of this compound as [Ru(CO) 2 F+. RuF 6 -]n. This compound can react further with carbon monoxide to give a series of moisture- sensitive carbonyl fluorides, but under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, the air-stable species Ru(CO) 2 F 2 is formed. Carbonyl fluorides of osmium and iridium can also be formed by reaction of higher fluorides with carbon monoxide. The reactions of phosphorus trifluoride and carbon monoxide with PtF 4. 2 BrF 3, and with platinum tetrafluoride obtained by the thermal decomposition of this complex, have been investigated. The isolation of Pt(PF 3) 2 Br 2 and Pt(CO) 2 Br 2 from these reactions, {{and the existence of}} the previously reported carbonyl fluoride, Pt(CO) 2 F 8, are discussed...|$|E

AsF 3 was {{prepared}} by the reaction of sulfur with <b>arsenic</b> <b>pentafluoride</b> in liquid AsF 3 (quantitatively) and in anhydrous HF {{in the presence of}} trace amounts of bromine. A single-crystal X-ray structure of the compound has been determined: monoclinic, space group P 2 (1) /c, Z = 4, a = 7. 886 (1) Angstrom, b = 9. 261 (2) Angstrom, c = 19. 191 (3) Angstrom, beta = 92. 82 (1) degrees, V = 1399. 9 (4) Angstrom(3), T = 293 K, R- 1 = 0. 052 for 1563 reflections (I > 2 sigma(I) 1580 total and 235 parameters). We report a term-by-term calculation of the lattice potential energy of this salt and also use our generalized equation, which estimates lattice energies to assist in probing the homopolyatomic cation thermochemistry in the solid and the gaseous states. We find S- 4 (ASF(6)) (2). ASF(3) to be more stable (Delta(f) H degrees[S- 4 (AsF 6) (2). AsF 3,c] approximate to - 4050 +/- 105 kJ/mol) than either the unsolvated S- 4 (AsF 6) (2) (Delta(f) H degrees[S- 4 (ASF(6)) (2),c] approximate to - 3104 +/- 117 kJ/ mel) by 144 kJ/mol or two moles of S 2 AsF 6 (c) and AsF 3 (1) by 362 kJ/mol. The greater stability of the S- 4 (2 +) Salt arises because of the greater lattice potential energy of the 1 : 2 solvated salt (1734 kJ/mol) relative to twice that of the 1 : 1 salt (2 x 541 = 1082 kJ/mol). The relative lattice stabilization enthalpies of M- 4 (2 +) ions relative to two M- 2 (+) ions (i. e., in M- 4 (AsF 6) (2) (c) With respect to two M 2 AsF 6 (c) (M = S, Se, and Te)) are found to be 218, 289, and 365 kJ/mol, respectively. Evaluation of the thermodynamic data implies that appropriate presently available anions are unlikely to stabilize M- 2 (+) in the solid phase. A revised value for Delta(f) H degrees[Se- 4 (AsF 6) (2),c] = - 3182 +/- 106 kJ/mol is proposed based on estimates of the lattice energy of Se- 4 (AsF 6) (2) (c) and a previously calculated gasphase dimerization energy of 2 Se(2) (+) to Se- 4 (2 +) ...|$|E
