50|$|The Chase {{family is}} an American family {{involved}} in politics in the 19th century. Originating in Chesham, England, brothers Aquila Chase II and Thomas Chase journeyed to New England in 1636, shortly after the Pilgrims. Most of the notable {{members of the family}} were descendants of Aquila Chase, whose children settled in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, members of the Chase family, who had previously been wealthy but not particularly influential, began involving themselves in law, politics, and religion. Lawyers such as Scott Lord (whose mother was a Chase) and Salmon Portland Chase, Chief Justice of the United States, were produced. Chase politicians included Dudley Chase, Champion S. Chase, Dudley Chase Denison, and Margaret Chase Smith. Though the Chase politicians were perhaps best known, the family produced several notable clergymen as well, including Episcopal bishop and educator Philander Chase and the Presbyterian theologian John Chase Lord, who were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefronts</b> <b>of</b> their respective churches in their prime.|$|R

He led it to a disastrous defeat at the 1780 Battle of Camden, where he was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> <b>of</b> a panicked retreat. Gates never commanded troops in the field again.|$|E
