5|$|Basehead has {{received}} praise for its distinctive sound and lyrics. The group's music incorporates elements of various genres, including blues, funk, hip hop and rock.

Beginning with the 1996 release of Faith, the group's lyrics have focused primarily on Christian themes, which carried over to its albums In the Name of Jesus, dc Basehead and Rockalyptic Music.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too ill {{to participate in the}} battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E

5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Joaquín {{returned}} to Monterrey to preach {{to his former}} associates.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations there was another group living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian national identity.

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the mature RNA as the ends are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> kind.

5|$|Słowacki {{was not a}} {{very popular}} figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E
5|$|The Great Raid of 1840 was {{the largest}} Indian raid on white cities {{in the history of}} what is now the United States—though {{technically}} when it occurred it was in the Republic of Texas <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the United States. The war party literally burned one city to the ground. They took over 3,000 horses and mules, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of other plunder, ranging from silver to cloth and mirrors. Unfortunately for the war party, the sheer volume of loot slowed them down, and made them vulnerable to attack from a militia that otherwise would never have caught them. Equally, the militia missed an opportunity to destroy the bulk of the raiding party when they concentrated on recovering and dividing the recovered bullion and other plunder.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds in open {{coniferous}} {{and mixed}} forest with a brushy understory, in dry open oak forests, and in chaparral and other scrubland. It is particularly associated with pinyon pines, junipers, and oaks. It migrates {{to the south}} late in the fall, returning north in mid-spring. While migrating, it forages in any woodland or scrub it passes through. In its wintering grounds, it occurs in dry woodland and tall scrub. Though its status is not well known, {{it does not appear}} to be seriously threatened by habitat destruction or other human activities, unlike many migratory warblers. It is a fairly common bird, among the most common in some localities. Because it is common <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> rapid decline, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

The sori are round, and are found on veins ending in the false indusium, below the veins' ends. The spores are tetrahedral to globose, yellow in color, and measure 41 to 58micrometers(μm) in diameter (averaging 51.4μm), on average larger than other species in the A.pedatum complex. Spores appear in the summer and fall. The species has a chromosome number of 116 in the sporophyte.|$|E
