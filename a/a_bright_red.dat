5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president {{when he and}} James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or bright red), and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E
5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E

5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is a crustose lichen, {{because it}} {{grows in the}} form of a surface crust. The thallus, or body of the lichen is spread out flat and can be either tightly to loosely {{attached}} to the growing surface. It is 0.15–0.30mm thick, and can be smooth, or have low radiating ridges. The older, central region of the lichen surface has many reproductive structures called isidia; they resemble granules that are 0.1–0.4 by 0.1mm. The species relies entirely on vegetative means to reproduce, and is not known to have any sexual structures. From the center outwards, three color zones can be differentiated in mature specimens; the first grayish-green, the second white, and finally <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> cottony rim.|$|E
5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta is {{a species}} of lichen in the Arthoniaceae family of fungi. The species is {{distributed}} in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen {{give the appearance of}} a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E

5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E
