40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{efficacy}} of a two staged treating strategy {{with the use of}} a non-permanent urethral ALLIUM ® stent for the management of recurrent bladder neck stenosis and subsequently the use of an <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> AUS 800 ® by AMS for the management of the incontinence. Materials and Methods: We progressively identified patients eligible for the study creating a population of cases with recurrent bladder neck stenosis and concomitant incontinence occurring after the last intervention for the stenosis. Efficacy for the treatment of the stenosis was defined as no recurrence both prior and post to the sphincter placement and efficacy for the treatment of the incontinence was defined as continence (0 - 1 pads) after the sphincter placement. Results and Limitations: 14 white males with a mean age of 66. 21, ranging from 59 to 73 years consisted the population of the study. All patients had severe stress incontinence following the last transurethral resection. The efficacy of the treatment of the bladder neck stenosis was 93 % (13 / 14) while the efficacy for the treatment of the incontinence was 100 %. A single patient had a recurrent bladder neck stenosis after the <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> placement and was treated with transurethral resection using a long pediatric 13 F resectoscope at 12 months. Our limitations is the absence of a control group and the small number of patients enrolled, with a relatively short time of follow up. Conclusions: In our series we propose the use of a non-permanent urethral ALLIUM ® stent for 6 months in order to control the growth of fibrotic scar tissue, a further 6 months follow up for recurrence, and then placement of an <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter.</b> The results are very promising both on stabilizing the vesicourethral stenosis, and on patient safety and tolerability...|$|E

The urgency of writing this article was {{a high incidence of}} prostate cancer, which has no tendency to decrease. It should be noted that when choosing the optimal method for treating prostate cancer, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} stage of the disease development, the patient’s age, concomitant diseases, possible complications, test results, and the wishes of the patient. In the stages of prostate cancer T 1 T 2, radical prostatectomy in any of its embodiments, openly laparoscopically or with the help of a robot is a routine operation, at stage T 3, in order to achieve an acceptable result, it is necessary not only sufficient surgical technique, but the correct preoperative preparation (the use of hormone therapy). One of the frequent complications of radical prostatectomy at stage T 3 is urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, which is caused by the need for more “aggressive” techniques, the frequency of which reaches, in the opinion of different authors, 30 to 90 %. With incontinence after a radical prostatectomy of moderate and severe degree, the implantation of an artificial urethral sphincter remains the preferred method of treatment. <b>Artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> allows you to fully control the process of retention of urine and urination. Note that the restoration of potency after surgery is a very difficult problem.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: The {{treatment}} of posterior urethral strictures or bladder neck contracture associated with severe urinary incontinence after prostate surgery and failure of endoscopic treatments is controversial. We report our {{experience with a}} transperineal approach in two steps: end-to-end urethroplasty/anastomosis and subsequent <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> implantation. METHODS: Between September 2001 and January 2005, we observed six patients (58 - 68 yr old), {{with a combination of}} severe urinary incontinence and posterior urethral stricture with anastomotic bladder neck contracture after prostate surgery. In all cases, repeated endoscopic treatments of the strictures failed. The patients underwent transperineal end-to-end urethroplasty or anastomosis followed by transperineal <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> placement after 6 mo. RESULTS: After the first surgical step, all patients were completely incontinent with absence of urethral strictures and complete anastomotic healing in all cases. Therefore, all patients underwent <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> insertion. After a mean follow-up of 38 mo (range: 18 - 57 mo), five patients are continent with no postvoid residual urine and a perfectly functioning device. One <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> was removed due to urethral erosion. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with posterior urethral strictures or bladder neck contractures associated with severe urinary incontinence, an <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> implantation as a second step allows verification of the outcome of a previous end-to-end urethroplasty or anastomosis and utilizes a dedicated operative field to reduce the risks of prosthesis implants...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Although {{long-term}} outcomes {{after initial}} placement of artificial urinary sphincters are established, limited data exist comparing sphincter survival {{in patients with}} compromised urethras (prior radiation, <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> placement or urethroplasty). We evaluated <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> failure in patients with compromised and noncompromised urethras. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 86 sphincters placed at a single institution between December 1997 and September 2012. We assessed patient demographic, comorbid disease and surgical characteristics. All nonfunctioning, eroded or infected devices were considered failures. Results: Of the 86 patients reviewed 67 (78 %) had compromised urethras and had higher failure rates than the noncompromised group (34 % vs 21 %, p= 0. 02). Compared to the noncompromised group, cases of prior radiation therapy (HR 4. 78; 95 % CI 1. 27, 18. 04), urethroplasty (HR 8. 61; 95 % CI 1. 27, 58. 51) and previous <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> placement (HR 8. 14; 95 % CI 1. 71, 38. 82) had a significantly increased risk of failure. The risk of <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> failure increased with more prior procedures. An increased risk of failure was observed after 3. 5 cm cuff placement (HR 8. 62; 95 % CI 2. 82, 26. 36) but not transcorporal placement (HR 1. 21; 95 % CI 0. 49, 2. 99). Conclusions: <b>Artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> placement in patients with compromised urethras from prior <b>artificial</b> urinary <b>sphincter</b> placement, radiation or urethroplasty had a statistically significant higher risk of failure than placement in patients with noncompromised urethras.

50|$|This is also termed <b>artificial</b> anal <b>sphincter</b> or neosphincter. The usual {{surgical}} {{approach is}} through the perineum or alternatively via the vagina. The <b>artificial</b> bowel <b>sphincter</b> involves the implantation of 3 components: (i) A fluid filled silicone elastomer cuff placed around the anus, (ii) a liquid filled, pressure-regulating balloon positioned in the peritoneal fat, and (iii) a manual pump connecting these components (placed in either the labia majora or the scrotum). When the cuff is inflated, the anal canal sealed. The fluid is transferred to the balloon by the manual pump, resulting in deflation of the cuff, opening of the anal canal and allowing for defecation. This procedure improves FI scores and quality of life, and continence is excellent when the procedure works (successful outcome in 85% patients with a functioning device). The procedure is less technically demanding than the graciloplasty, but there is the disadvantage of using foreign material, which can erode through the anal canal. As with graciloplasty, obstructed defecation may develop with a working device, and may be treated with enemas. Complications include infection, which may warrant temporary removal of the device. Graciloplasty and <b>artificial</b> anal <b>sphincter</b> both significantly improve continence, with <b>artificial</b> anal <b>sphincter</b> being superior, however both methods have high rates of complications.|$|R

[Article in Spanish] López Pereira P, Martínez Urrutia MJ, Lobato L, Rivas S, Jaureguizar Monereo E. SourceUnidad de Urología Infantil, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid. Abstract PURPOSE: To assess the grade of satisfaction in children on intermittent catheterization with the use of LoFric and PVC conventional catheters. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 p with experience in CIC were included in this study. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all patients after 2 -months using the LoFric catheter. Patients were divided in 3 groups (bladder augmentation, <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter,</b> Mitrofanoff) because of major differences in CIC discomfort between these groups. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 87. 5 % of the patients (35 p). In 86 % (30 p) LoFric catheter training was easy or very easy but in 14 % (5 p) it was difficult. Four patients had some difficulty during conventional catheter insertion, in 3 (75 %) the difficulty disappeared with the use of LoFric catheter. Of the 51 % (18 p) who reported some discomfort during the insertion of conventional catheter, 72 % said it was eliminated when the LoFric catheter was used. Of 6 p with some discomfort when removing the conventional catheter, 5 (83 %) said it disappeared with the new catheter. Th LoFric catheter was favored by 70 % of patients because it reduced the discomfort caused by conventional catheters, bladder insertion was easier and smoother, and gel lubrication was not needed.

40|$|Fecal {{incontinence}} {{describes the}} involuntary loss of bowel content and affects about 45 % of retirement home residents and overall more than 12 % {{of the adult}} population. <b>Artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> implants for treating incontinence are currently based on mechanical systems with failure rates resulting in revision after three to five years. To overcome this drawback, artificial muscle sphincters based on bio-mimetic electro-active polymer (EAP) actuators are under development.

Strain-dependent resistivity measurements reveal an enhanced conductivity of 10 nm compared to 30 nm sputtered Au on silicone for strains higher than 5 %. Thus, strain dependent morphology characterization with optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy could demonstrate these phenomena.

40|$|Introduction and objectives: The AMS 800 TM is {{considered}} {{the gold standard for}} sphincter replacement. However, the one-ring design can erode the urethra and lead to severe complications. A mechanism that could alternatively compress successive segments of the urethra would limit such deleterious outcome. We report 12 weeks animal urethral tissue analysis following implantation of a new modular <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter.</b> METHODS: The device is composed by three parts: the contractile unit, two rings and an integrated microprocessor. The contractile unit is made of Nitinol fibers. The rings are placed around the urethra to control the flow of urine by squeezing the urethra. They work in a sequential alternative mode and are controlled by a microprocessor connected to an external computer. The computer can reveal specific failure of device components. The device was impkanted in eight male sheep. The rings were positioned around the urethra and the control unit was placed 5 cm away. The device was working twenty hours per day; it was open 10 min. per hour to allow urination. The animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks. The urethra and the tissues surrounding the control unit were macroscopically and microscopically examined. Two transversal sections crossing the sphincter and two transversal sections crossing the urethra alone were obtained and stained with modified Paragon after resin embedding. Urethra was also embedded in paraffin. The first section was stained with safranin-hematoxylin-eosin, the second section was stained with Masson's Trichrome and the remaining eight sections were available for immunolabelling of the macrophages. Results: The chronic study went uneventful. No clinical infection or pain was observed. The computer registered no specific failure in ring function, Nitinol wires and tube connectors. At explantation, except for a slight grade of lymphocytes in two out of eight specimens, no urethral stricture or atrophy could be observed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the absence of macrophages. Tissue structure and organization of the urethra with and without <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> were similar. No migration of the device was observed. Conclusions: The study clearly showed no tissue damage or inflammation of the urethra. Electronic design, preservation of urethral vascularisation and adjustability after implantation are the key ideas to improve the actual AUS.

40|$|PURPOSE: The <b>artificial</b> bowel <b>sphincter</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to treat patients with fecal incontinence. The good results achieved with this procedure encouraged us to use this device for reconversion of patients who previously underwent an abdominoperineal resection. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2001, we selected eight patients for the total anorectal reconstruction, five for a synchronous reconstruction, and three cases for a delayed procedure. One patient was male and seven were female. The mean age was 52. 6 years. All the patients underwent a postoperative manometry and defecography. Continence {{and quality of life}} scores were also evaluated in the follow-up. RESULTS: The follow-up length ranged from 6 to 28 months. Manometry assessed a basal pressure with the ABS cuff inflated between 58 and 62. 2 mmHg. All but one patient achieved a good grade of continence with a Wexner score range between 3 and 9. A certain degree of impaired evacuation occurred in three patients, but with adequate training this improved and did not affect patient's satisfaction. The administered questionnaires demonstrated a significant improvement in quality of life scores for stoma patients and an elevated quality of life in patients synchronously treated with <b>artificial</b> bowel <b>sphincter</b> implant. CONCLUSION: The <b>artificial</b> bowel <b>sphincter</b> is a good option for reconstruction of patients previously treated with an abdominoperineal resection. The procedure is feasible and safe, without serious postoperative complications. The quality of life is improved when the procedure is performed in stabilized stoma patients and is acceptable for motivated patients synchronously implanted.

40|$|Post-prostatectomy urinary {{incontinence}} is an uncommon complication of adenomectomies, occurring in approximately 1 % of cases and being more frequent following radical prostatectomies.

Considering the low efficacy of peri-urethral injections and the high cost of artificial sphincters, we present in this work a technical modification of the suburethral sling, whose preliminary results are satisfactory. The fundamental modification in this technique is due to the replacement of the synthetic material usually employed for making the sling for autologous tissue, constituted by an aponeurotic strip taken from the rectus muscle of abdomen. This modification aims to minimize risks of urethral erosion that, despite it was not described in this population due to the use of synthetic materials, is a possibility when facing the tension that is used over the bulbar urethra.

40|$|Fecal {{incontinence}} {{describes the}} involuntary loss of bowel content, {{which is responsible}} for stigmatization and social exclusion. It affects about 45 % of retirement home residents and overall more than 12 % of the adult population. Severe fecal incontinence can be treated by the implantation of an <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter.</b> Currently available implants, however, are not part of everyday surgery due to long-term re-operation rates of 95 % and definitive explantation rates of 40 %. Such figures suggest that the implants fail to reproduce the capabilities of the natural sphincter. This article reviews the artificial sphincters on the market and under development, presents their physical principles of operation and critically analyzes their performance. We highlight the geometrical and mechanical parameters crucial for the design of an artificial fecal sphincter and propose more advanced mechanisms of action for a biomimetic device with sensory feedback. Dielectric electro-active polymer actuators are especially attractive because of their versatility, response time, reaction forces, and energy consumption. The availability of such technology will enable fast pressure adaption comparable to the natural feedback mechanism, so that tissue atrophy and erosion can be avoided while maintaining continence during daily activities...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometric}} {{characterization of}} low-voltage dielectric electro-active polymer (EAP) structures, comprised of nanometer thickness but areas of square centimeters, for {{applications such as}} artificial sphincters requires methods with nanometer precision. Direct optical detection is usually restricted to sub-micrometer resolution because of the wavelength of the light applied. Therefore, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the cantilever bending system with optical readout revealing a sub-micrometer resolution at the deflection of the free end. It is demonstrated that this approach allows us to detect bending of rather conventional planar asymmetric, dielectric EAP-structures applying voltages well below 10 V. For this purpose, we built 100 μm-thin silicone films between 50 nm-thin silver layers on a 25 μm-thin polyetheretherketone (PEEK) substrate. The increase of the applied voltage in steps of 50 V until 1 kV resulted in a cantilever bending that exhibits only in restricted ranges the expected square dependence. The mean laser beam displacement on the detector corresponded to 6 nm per volt. The apparatus will therefore become a powerful mean to analyze and thereby improve low-voltage dielectric EAP-structures to realize nanometer-thin layers for stack actuators to be incorporated into <b>artificial</b> <b>sphincter</b> systems for treating severe urinary and fecal incontinence...|$|E
