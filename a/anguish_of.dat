5|$|Bhuvan {{begins to}} prepare the villagers for the match. He {{initially}} finds only five people willing to join the team. He is aided in his efforts by Russell's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley) who feels that her brother has mistreated the villagers. As she teaches them {{the rules of the}} game, she falls in love with Bhuvan, much to the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> Gauri (Gracy Singh) who is also in love with him. After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

25|$|Along these lines, {{the concept}} of Reward and Punishment in the World to Come was {{abolished}} as well. The only perceived form of retribution for the wicked, if any, was the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> their soul after death, and vice versa, bliss was the single accolade for {{the spirits of the}} righteous. Angels and Heavenly Hosts were also deemed a foreign superstitious influence, especially from early Zoroastrian sources, and denied.|$|E

The feature was accompanied by photographs of some of the dead, while a further article dealt with the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> surviving soldiers on their return home. Araya later said that the article [...] "blew his mind".|$|E

She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling. [...] singing a solo song about one's troubled (though reconciled and apparently happy) marriage. Although sometimes she looks cross instead. And quite a lot of the time, she looks like she's her own evil sexy twin." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's use of clownfish {{prompted}} mass {{purchase of}} the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain. The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu. The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilizing Finding Nemo clips. Queensland used Finding Nemo to draw tourists to promote its state for vacationers. According to National Geographic, [...] "Ironically, Finding Nemo, a movie about the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> a captured clownfish, caused home-aquarium demand for them to triple." ...|$|E

[...] The chorus switches {{to a series of}} power chords building from A, the vocals proclaiming: [...] "I'm eighteen/ And I don't know what I want... I gotta get out of this place/ I'll go runnin' in outer space". [...] The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had caused such anguish: [...] "I'm eighteen and I like it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{grounds of}} the Kew Asylum were {{originally}} landscaped {{in the tradition of}} an English country park. [...] This was consistent with the Victorian idea that pleasant or beautiful surroundings would help ease the mental <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> the inmates. [...] It has been proposed that the initial plantings on the site were supplied by Baron Ferdinand von Mueller, director of the Botanic Gardens. Initially, the grounds were planted with many conifers and large growing trees, oaks, elms and Moreton Bay figs; and trees indigenous to the area, river red gum, yellow box, and lightwood were retained in the landscape. In 1913 the landscape gardener Hugh Linaker was employed to lay out the grounds of Mont Park Asylum. As landscape gardener for the State Lunacy Department he commenced a program of landscape improvements and tree plantings at other asylums in Victoria, including Kew.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review in the}} 1831 Westminster Review, J. Fox praises the {{depiction}} of women within the whole of Poems, Chiefly Lyrics and says that Tennyson's [...] "portraits are delicate, his likenesses [...] perfect, and they have life, character, and individuality. They are nicely assorted also to all the different gradations of emotion and passion which are expressed {{in common with the}} descriptions of them. There is an appropriate object for every shade of feeling, from the light touch of passing admiration to the triumphant madness of soul and sense, or the deep and everlasting <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> survivorship." [...] A review by a [...] "Professor Lyall" [...] in 1878 argues, [...] "As descriptive poetry, and for that feature of realistic description so characteristic of Tennyson's muse, 'Mariana' has, perhaps, not been surpassed even by him." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his ongoing health {{problems}} and several operations for ulcers and hernias, Cooper continued to work in action films. In 1958, he appeared in Anthony Mann's Western drama Man of the West (1958) with Julie London and Lee J. Cobb, about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members. The film has been called Cooper's [...] "most pathological Western", with its themes of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, [...] "understood the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> a character striving to retain his integrity ... brought authentic feeling {{to the role of}} a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man". Mostly ignored by critics at the time, the film is now well-regarded by film scholars and is considered Cooper's last great film.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a lesbian {{identity}} is also explored throughout Journey to a Woman, as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself {{at the end of}} the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in Women in the Shadows. Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in Odd Girl Out and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain [...] "a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery". Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.|$|E
500|$|Going beyond {{specific}} characters, or even specific {{interactions among}} them, Hazlitt delineates {{what he calls}} the [...] "logic of passion", the rhythm of emotions in the drama, and its effect on the mind of the reader or viewer. [...] "We see {{the ebb and flow of}} the feeling, its pauses and feverish starts, its impatience of opposition, its accumulating force when it has had time to recollect itself, the manner in which it avails itself of every passing word or gesture, its haste to repel insinuation, the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul, and all 'the dazzling fence of controversy' in this mortal combat with poisoned weapons, aimed at the heart, where each wound is fatal." [...] He observes, too, in explaining an instance of what later came to be called comic relief, how when the reader's feelings are strained to the utmost, [...] "just as [...] the fibres of the heart [...] are growing rigid from over-strained excitement [...] he imagination is glad to take refuge in the half-comic, half-serious comments of the Fool, just as the mind under the extreme <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> a surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} is structured like a prelude and fugue, the prelude covering {{the beginning of}} the biblical verse, the fugue the <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> the Lord's wrath. The [...] "prelude" [...] begins with 16 measures of instrumental music, with the strings [...] "engaged in a persistent sobbing commentary", as John Eliot Gardiner puts it, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in the Brunswick Cathedral. In the second round of vocal entries, each part is intensified by a wind instruments. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes about Bach's different ways to convey the distress of the text: [...] "There is frequent stressing of the word [...] "Schmerz" [...] (sorrow). Suspensions and dissonant seventh chords in the harmony add to the tension as do the uses of the highly expressive Neapolitan chord and false relations". The fugue, marked [...] "Un poco allegro", covers {{the second part of the}} verse, translating to [...] "For the Lord has made me full of anguish on the day of his wrathful anger." [...] The fugue builds from two vocal parts and continuo to nine parts. Gardiner writes: [...] "It is uncompromising in its contrapuntal wildness and grim, dissonant harmony." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
