500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it would be great to go back, because I'm <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
2500|$|The May 18 {{article in}} The Hill, which was {{published}} prior to Clarke's May 25 claim of responsibility, quoted 9/11 Commission vice-chair Lee H. Hamilton as saying: [...] "We don't know who authorized [...] We've <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> 50 times." [...] A May 26 article in The Hill quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: [...] "It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don't think that the questions are resolved, {{and we need to}} dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem {{to say that he was}} the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to look for some more answers." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{left the}} HCIS in March 1973 {{and joined the}} United States Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (Watergate Committee) as the Deputy Minority Counsel. One of Sanders' {{responsibilities}} was to gather evidence by interviewing officials and aides {{to find out more}} information about the Watergate break-in. The most famous of these interviews occurred on Friday, July 13, 1973. Alexander Butterfield (Federal Aviation Administration head and a former White House aide) was being privately questioned by Senate committee staff members, when Sanders asked if it were possible that a recording system had been used in the White House. Butterfield answered: [...] "I wish you hadn't <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> but, yes, there is." [...] Sanders went to relay the news to Fred Thompson, who was the Minority Counsel. Sanders first had to call him out of a local restaurant. [...] "Because he was with some reporters, I got him away from them, and got him out on the street corner and told him the story", Sanders said.|$|E

60|$|Celia's {{consciousness}} {{told her}} that she had not been at all in the wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say? My dear sir,' {{returned}} Mrs. Markleham, {{shaking her}} head and her fan, 'you little know my poor Jack Maldon when you <b>ask</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> Say? Not he. You might drag him at the heels of four wild horses first.' ...|$|R

60|$|Something in the {{expression}} of her eyes, as she <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> warned Magdalen to turn her face further inward from the window than she had turned it yet.

6000|$|The Stael was at {{the other}} end of the table, and less loquacious than heretofore. We are now very good friends; though she asked Lady Melbourne whether I had really any bonhommie.
