5|$|Maunsell {{was aware}} of the {{reputation}} for poor steaming enjoyed by the class and attempted to <b>address</b> <b>it</b> by the fitting of twin Kylchap blastpipes to No. 860 in 1934. However, the problem was ultimately solved by Oliver Bulleid, Maunsell's replacement as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern in 1938. He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was highly respected.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} reports, Donaghy stayed at his home, {{before moving to}} a secure {{location}} to avoid the media scrutiny. He surrendered on August 15, 2007, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy. He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players' physical condition and player/referee relations, and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies. Donaghy also {{admitted that he had}} a severe gambling addiction, and was on medication to <b>address</b> <b>it.</b> He was released on a $250,000 bond.|$|E

5|$|First {{introduced}} in FreeBSD version 4, jails is a security mechanism and an implementation of operating-system-level virtualization {{that enables the}} user to run multiple instances of a guest operating system {{on top of a}} FreeBSD host. It is an enhanced version of the traditional chroot mechanism. A process that runs within such a jail is unable to access the resources outside of it. Every jail has its own hostname and IP <b>address.</b> <b>It</b> is possible to run multiple jails at the same time, but the kernel is shared among all of them. Hence only software supported by the FreeBSD kernel can be run within a jail.|$|E
5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help <b>address</b> <b>it</b> with this project.|$|E

When the processor detects a call to that <b>address,</b> <b>it</b> instead redirects to the target location without causing an access violation. This requires hardware support, but the hardware for it is quite common.|$|E

But some countries are not prepared to expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through nuclear power phase-out legislation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{classes and}} {{structures}} {{are similar in}} both {{the way they are}} declared and how they are used, there are some significant differences. Classes are reference types and structs are value types. A structure is allocated on the stack when it is declared and the variable is bound to its <b>address.</b> <b>It</b> directly contains the value. Classes are different because the memory is allocated as objects on the heap. Variables are rather managed pointers on the stack which point to the objects. They are references.|$|E
