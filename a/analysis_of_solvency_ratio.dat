40|$|The {{financial}} position {{of an economic}} entity {{is a concept that}} can have different meanings, depending on the stakeholder category that make its analysis. In energy sector, which is considered of high importance in the national economy, we consider that the most important category of stakeholder is the state (government), because ensuring the functionality of this sector is an crucial condition for development of others sectors from national economy. For this reason, we can look at the informational needs of other stakeholder categories trough the state’s “sine qua non” condition to ensure the optimal functionality of this sector, which manifests itself like this: the functioning of the sector involves the attraction of investors, the functioning of the sector involves the existence of human resources, the functioning of the sector cannot be ensured without the existence of commercial relations that involves suppliers and clients and for insuring the functioning of the sector it is often require various financing sources. All those aspects are giving raise to some categories of stakeholder interested over the parameters in which the energy sector entities are functioning, one of the interest domain being the {{financial position}} of the companies activating in its field. Over the present study we had in view to highlight the main present approaches regarding the concept of financial position, but also the main issues fallowed by the main stakeholder categories in their attempt to appreciate the financial position of the entities activating in energy sector which are listed to Bucharest Stock Exchange.

Within this research field, two major models can be classified [...] - “classical statistical models ” and “stochastic intensity models”. However few of them can obtain probability of insolvency and expected ratio of liquidity gap at the same time. In addition, within the above two frameworks, few studies apply stochastic <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> models to predict corporate liquidity crisis. Basing upon the two significant characteristics <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> [...] “mean-reversion ” and “non-negative value ” {{and the concept of}} varying coefficient model, the study develops a multi-period corporate {{short-term credit}} risk model by constructing an ”time-dependent stochastic <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> model”.

40|$|Investors' {{learning}} {{of the state of}} future real fundamentals from current inflation leads to macroeconomic state dependence of asset valuations and <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>of</b> firms within given rating categories. Since credit spreads are convex functions <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios,</b> average spreads are higher than spreads at average <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios.</b> Macroeconomic shocks carry risk premiums so that expected default losses are more sensitive to changes in the price of risk than are credit spreads.

40|$|The banking {{sector is}} under {{prudential}} regulations set internationally by the Basel Committee, {{in order to}} ensure its strength, stability and mitigate competitive inequities. Its founding principle is based on a minimum <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> introduced in 1988 {{in the form of the}} Cooke ratio, resulting in a harmonization of the rules of banking supervision governing the level of own funds. Basel II was introduced after the various financial crises of the 1990 s (the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis, and the Brazilian and Argentinean crisis). Despite a series of reforms, Basel II has quickly shown its limitations with the 2007 crisis that has strongly impacted the financial markets and the world economy generally. In this context, the Basel Committee has developed within Basel III a number of requirements which aim at strengthening the resilience of the banking institutions and financial system. These adjustments will be applied to the three pillars already in place and relate to capital, liquidity and systemic risks. The new Basel provisions relating to the calculation of the numerator <b>of</b> the <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio</b> are declined according to the triptych: strengthening the quality of prudential eligible own funds instruments, increase of the statutory deductions provided by Basel II, and higher minimum thresholds <b>of</b> <b>solvency</b> <b>ratios.</b> Furthermore, a limitation of the lever, calculated from the balance sheet and elements of off-balance sheet based on non-weighted by the risks, will be introduced. The Basel III criteria entering into force between 2013 and 2018 constitute one of the major challenges to which the banking sector will face. The real impact of the Basel III reform will depend on the attitude of the banks that will have to change in their strategy, their cost structure and policy of remuneration of the shareholders. A reform which will have therefore an impact on the world economy ensuring as estimated by Governors and supervisors, stability and long term economic performance.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} optimal asset {{allocation}} {{problem for a}} continuous time pension fund under a value at risk constraint. The affiliate’s payments stream is deter-ministic and the mortality is modelled by a geometric Brownian. The financial market is composed of risky assets driven by geometric Brownian motions. We address {{the case of a}} fund manager who wishes to maximize quadratic utility <b>of</b> the <b>solvency</b> <b>ratio,</b> defined as the market value of assets divided by the mathematical reserve under a VAR constraint. The method of Lagrange multipliers is combined with the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation to insert the risk management constraint in the framework of resolution. A numerical method is then developed to yield an approximation of the solution of the HJB equation. Finally, we show on examples how the introduction of a VAR constraint modifies the optimal investment strategy. 1...|$|R
