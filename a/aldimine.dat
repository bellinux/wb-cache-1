25|$|In {{analogy with}} other β-replacement enzymes, the {{reaction}} catalyzed by CBS {{is predicted to}} involve a series of adoMet-bound intermediates. Addition of serine results in a transchiffization reaction, which forms of an external <b>aldimine.</b> The <b>aldimine</b> undergoes proton abstraction at the α-carbon followed by elimination to generate an amino-acrylate intermediate. Nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of homocysteine on the aminoacrylate and reprotonation at Cα generate the external <b>aldimine</b> of cystathionine. A final transaldimination reaction releases the final product, cystathionine. The final product, L-cystathionine can also form an aminoacrylate intermediate, indicating that the entire reaction of CBS is reversible.|$|E

2500|$|The heme domain {{contains}} an N-terminal loop that binds heme {{and provides the}} axial ligands C52 and H65. [...] The distance of heme from the PLP binding site suggests its non-role in catalysis, however deletion of the heme domain causes loss of redox sensitivity, therefore it is hypothesized that heme is a redox sensor. The presence of protoporphyrin IX in CBS is a unique PLP-dependent enzyme and is only found in the mammalian CBS. [...] D. melanogaster and D. discoides have truncated N-terminal extensions and therefore prevent the conserved histidine and cysteine heme ligand residues. [...] However, the Anopheles gambiae sequence has a longer N-terminal extension than the human enzyme and contains the conserved histidine and cysteine heme ligand residues like the human heme. [...] Therefore, {{it is possible that}} CBS in slime molds and insects are hemeproteins that suggest that the heme domain is an early evolutionary innovation that arose before the separation of animals and the slime molds. The PLP is an internal <b>aldimine</b> and forms a Schiff base with K119 in the active site. [...] Between the catalytic and regulatory domains exists a hypersensitive site that causes proteolytic cleavage and produces a truncated dimeric enzyme that is more active than the original enzyme. [...] Both truncated enzyme and the enzyme found in yeast are not regulated by adoMet. The yeast enzyme is also activated by the deletion of the C-terminal to produce the dimeric enzyme.|$|E

The basic lysine residue is then able to deprotonate the alpha carbon, pushing electron density into the nitrogen of the pyridine ring. Pyridoxal phosphate is necessary to stabilize this carbanionic intermediate; otherwise the proton's pKa would be too high. The beta carbon is then deprotonated, creating an alpha-beta unsaturation and pushing a lone pair onto the <b>aldimine</b> nitrogen. To reform the <b>aldimine,</b> this lone pair pushes back down, cleaving the sulfur-gamma carbon bond, resulting in the release of cysteine.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of PLP-dependent enzymes form an internal <b>aldimine</b> with PLP via an active site lysine residue, some PLP-dependent enzymes do not have this lysine residue, but instead have a histidine in the active site. In such a case, the histidine cannot form the internal <b>aldimine,</b> and, therefore, the co-factor does not become covalently tethered to the enzyme. GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose-3-dehydratase (ColD) is an example of such an enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} of the {{catalytic}} cycle involves the enzyme accepting the substrate by forming an external <b>aldimine</b> with PLP replacing the PLP-Lys144β internal <b>aldimine.</b> With the cleavage of the internal <b>aldimine,</b> the β unit is able to swing towards {{to the top of}} the α unit and block the empty site. Therefore, generation of the Ado-CH2• radical leads to a change in the structure of the active domain, bringing the AdoCbl and PLP-substrate complex closer to each other, thus locking the enzyme in a “closed” state. The closed state exists until the radical transfer occurs when the product is released and AdoCbl is reformed. At the same time, the closed state is transformed to the open state again to wait for the next substrate.|$|E

50|$|PLP is {{employed}} as it binds to amino groups and stabilises carbanion intermediates. PLP enzymes exist in their resting {{state as a}} Schiff base, the aldehyde group of PLP forming a linkage with the epsilon-amino group of an active site lysine residue on the enzyme. The alpha-amino group of the substrate displaces the lysine epsilon-amino group, in the process forming a new <b>aldimine</b> with the substrate.

5000|$|HDC decarboxylates {{histidine}} {{through the}} use of a PLP cofactor initially bound in a Schiff base to lysine 305.

Finally, PLP re-forms its original Schiff base at lysine 305, and histamine is released. This mechanism is very similar to those employed by other pyridoxal-dependent decarboxylases. In particular, the <b>aldimine</b> intermediate is a common feature of all known PLP-dependent decarboxylases. [...] HDC is highly specific for its histidine substrate.|$|E

Removal of the N-activating group is performed through a one-vessel oxidation/ hydrolysis operation, which proceeds via a stable aza-quinone (characterized by X-ray crystallography). Evidence is presented indicating that reactions with chiral non-racemic aldehydes are subject to catalyst control: both substrate enantiomers react to afford the desired product diastereomers in high stereoselectivity. Aryl- and alkynyl-substituted o-thiomethyl-p-methoxyaniline-derived <b>aldimines</b> undergo Ag-catalyzed enantioselective VM more efficiently and with higher selectivity than the corresponding o-anisidyl substrates.
