His sketch of Faiz Mohammad characterizes him as a devout Shia Muslim, highly regarded by the Qizilbash community of Kabul, {{as well as a}} leader among his own people, the Hazaras, and an important source of information for the Persian mission <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in the capital.|$|E

Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about your life and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing <b>about,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E

The Little Prince was created when Saint-Exupéry was [...] "an expatriate and distraught <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in his country and in the world". It was written during his 27-month sojourn in North America, almost as a sort of credo, [...] "carefully employing the expressions of despair, loneliness, and triumph throughout its plotline".|$|E

The film arguably changes the original message by having removed any reference to actual Anarchism in the revolutionary actions of V. An interview with producer Joel Silver reveals that he identifies the V of the comics as a clear-cut [...] "superhero... a masked avenger who pretty much saves the world," [...] a simplification that goes against Moore's own statements about V's role in the story.|$|E

2500|$|While the author's {{personal}} life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exupéry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: [...] "On the one hand, {{he had a}} clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length. [...] The story, the curator added, was created when he was [...] "an ex-patriate and distraught <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in his country and in the world." ...|$|E

Hunter pointed out that the situation was delicate because of Joseph P. Kennedy's having been United States Ambassador to England. However, he believed the young naval intelligence officer was not privy to information that would be [...] "more than a bit embarrassing". Hunter advised that Kennedy be transferred to a seagoing unit.|$|E

Taylor, whose protégé, General Paul D. Harkins, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, was producing the optimistic reports that Vann's briefing was intended to contradict.|$|E
