25|$|For {{the remote}} {{associates}} tasks, the convergent thinkers correctly solved {{more of the}} five remote associates problems then did those using divergent thinking. This was demonstrated to be significantly different by a one-way <b>ANOVA.</b> In addition, when responding to insight problems, participants using convergent thinking solved more insight problems than did the control group, however, {{there was no significant}} difference between subjects using convergent or divergent thinking.|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis-driven {{statistical}} analysis: Identification of {{statistically significant}} changes in gene expression are commonly identified using the t-test, <b>ANOVA,</b> Bayesian method Mann–Whitney test methods tailored to microarray data sets, which take into account multiple comparisons or cluster analysis. These methods assess statistical power based on the variation present in the data {{and the number of}} experimental replicates, and can help minimize Type I and type II errors in the analyses.|$|E
30|$|To {{provide an}} initial {{overview}} of the findings, prior to presenting {{the results from the}} <b>ANOVAs,</b> we present mean scores for Usefulness, Negative/Problem, and Suggestion as bar charts for each of the two independent variables (Moderator and Direct view). This mode of presentation, where the independent variables are seen independently, is justified as no interaction effects were observed in the <b>ANOVAs</b> (to be presented below).|$|R
30|$|To {{verify that}} we {{observed}} the traditional low prevalence effect, we analyzed {{the data from}} the visual search blocks using two 2 (target present/target absent)[*]×[*] 2 (low/high prevalence block) repeated-measures <b>ANOVAs,</b> one on the corrected hit rate (percentage hits minus percentage false alarms) data and one on the reaction time data.

25|$|Experimental {{researchers}} typically use {{a statistical}} hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing {{how well the}} data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific hypothesis about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (<b>ANOVA)</b> statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the null hypothesis that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely usd standard ascribes statistical significance to results which have less than 5% probability of being explained by random variation.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{problems}} inherent in an observational study such as {{this is that the}} plots cannot be considered to be spatially independent, and standard statistical tests may, therefore, tend to overstate levels of significance. An attempt was made to account for this by including exponential spatial covariance structures in all the <b>ANOVAs.</b> This generally resulted in considerable reductions in levels of significance when compared with simple <b>ANOVAs,</b> but it was assumed that this analysis approach provided a truer reflection of the significance of each variable.|$|R

2500|$|The power spectrum, as {{indicated}} by this density function , measures the amount of variance contributed to the data by the frequency [...] In electrical signals, the variance {{is proportional to the}} average power (energy per unit time), and so the power spectrum describes how much the different frequencies contribute to the average power of the signal. This process is called the spectral analysis of time-series and is analogous to the usual analysis of variance of data that is not a time-series (<b>ANOVA).</b>|$|E
30|$|One- and two-way <b>ANOVAs</b> were {{performed}} with the feeding rate (mg (food)/(mg (gammarid)[*]×[*]d)) of replicates. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normal distribution and the Levene-Mediane test for equal variance {{were performed}} prior to <b>ANOVAs.</b> Multiple comparisons of resulting p values were by application of the Holm-Sidak test when normal distribution and equal variance were given. Otherwise, a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by an all pairwise comparison according to Dunn's method was used. Statistical analysis of feeding rates was undertaken with SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software Inc., London, UK).|$|R
30|$|The data {{obtained}} in the degranulation assays were analyzed by one-way <b>ANOVAs</b> and multiple comparisons using Tukey’s tests (P <  0.001). This analysis was performed by GraphPad Prism.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, these metrics can {{be analyzed}} like other social science data. As {{we were interested in}} comparisons among groups (i.e., leaders and non-leaders), we used <b>ANOVAs</b> to determine if there were any statistically significant difference among groups. <b>ANOVAs</b> were used instead of t tests because as we will discuss in the next section, we had three categories. We used post hoc tests to determine which two groups had statistically significant differences. Post hoc Tukey tests were used when variance was equal and Games-Howell when it was not.|$|R

30|$|Analyses were {{conducted}} separately by country and included teacher-level analyses (research question 1) and student-level analyses (research question 2). To address the first research question, descriptive statistics were calculated using teachers’ {{responses to the}} six individual teaching for conceptual understanding items {{and the results were}} represented both graphically and numerically. In addition, one-way <b>ANOVAs</b> with Bonferroni post hoc tests {{were conducted}} to examine whether the frequency of teaching for conceptual understanding in the U.S. was significantly different from the frequency in the East Asian countries. The descriptive statistics and <b>ANOVAs</b> allowed comparisons among countries with respect to mathematics teachers’ use of instructional practices that support conceptual understanding. In each country, sampling weights were used to make adjustments for non-response and to ensure that subgroups of the sample were properly represented in the estimation of population parameters (Joncas, 2008). Since the descriptive analyses and <b>ANOVAs</b> were based on teacher data, the mathematics teacher sampling weight (MATWGT) was applied to generate accurate estimates in each country.|$|R
