The low order model is shown to capture the dominant dynamics of the room air temperature response to a step change in the supply <b>air</b> flow <b>rate</b> with minimum levels of model complexity.

The energy used in operating a large buildings HVAC system scales with the <b>air</b> flow <b>rate</b> in the building, since a higher air volume results in higher energy expenditure for the fans to push the air and for the heating and cooling coils to condition the air.

40|$|Separation of {{particles}} of different surface properties using froth flotation is a widely-used industrial process, {{particularly in the}} minerals industry where {{it is used to}} concentrate minerals from ore. One of the key challenges in developing models to predict flotation performance is the interdependent nature of the process variables and operating parameters, which limits the application of optimising process control strategies at industrial scale. Froth stability, which can be quantified using air recovery (the fraction of air entering a flotation cell that overflows in the concentrate as unburst bubbles), {{has been shown to be}} linked to flotation separation performance, with stable froths yielding improved mineral recoveries. While it is widely acknowledged that there is an optimum particle size range for collection {{of particles}} in the pulp phase, the role of particle size on the measured air recovery and the resulting link to changes in flotation performance is less well understood. This is related to the difficulty in separating particle size and liberation effects. In this work, the effects of particle size distribution on air recovery are studied in a single species (silica) system using a continuous steady-state laboratory flotation cell. This allows an investigation into the effects of particle size distribution only on froth stability, using solids content and solids recovery as indicators of flotation performance. It is shown that, as the cell <b>air</b> <b>rate</b> is increased, the air recovery of the silica system passes through a peak, exhibiting the same froth behaviour as measured industrially. The air recovery profiles of systems with three different particle size distributions (d 80 of 89. 6, 103. 5 and 157. 1 μm) are compared. The results show that, at lower <b>air</b> <b>rates,</b> the intermediate particle size distribution (103. 5 μm) yields the most stable froth, while at higher <b>air</b> <b>rates,</b> the finest particles (89. 6 μm) result in higher air recoveries. This is subsequently linked to changes in flotation performance. The results presented here highlight, for the first time, the link between particle size distribution in flotation feeds, air recovery and flotation performance. The results demonstrate that there is an optimal <b>air</b> <b>rate</b> for each particle size distribution, therefore changes in particle size distribution in the feed to flotation cells require a change in <b>air</b> <b>rate</b> in order to maximise mineral recovery...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 74 family farms from the region of Podkarpacie. Information for the work was collected directly on farms using a prepared questionnaire. The results show that with the increasing surface, households increased their economic and organisational prosperity expressed by a higher gross margin and higher stocking <b>rates</b> (<b>LU).</b> In smaller farms, the animal-plant production profile typical of Subcarpathian (group II-IV), the growth potential is high. These farms have more land resources and animals that are used for food production. Their further development will be determined primarily by macroeconomic factors, as well as decisions about the way of management made by farmers. It should be emphasized, however, that failure to livestock or reduction (the abandonment of grazing pasture, lower stocking density) will contribute to the growth of uncultivated land surface, mostly on grassland difficult to be utilized in a different manner. ...|$|R
