40|$|In {{order to}} {{incorporate}} the customer into the early phase of the product development cycle and to better satisfy customers' requirements, this article adopts quality function deployment (QFD) for optimal design of <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> <b>product</b> platform. A five-step QFD-based method is proposed to determine the optimal values for platform engineering characteristics (ECs) and non-platform ECs of the products within a product family. First of all, the houses of quality (HoQs) for all product variants are developed and a QFD-based optimization approach is {{used to determine the}} optimal ECs for each product variant. Sensitivity analysis is performed for each EC with respect to overall customer satisfaction (OCS). Based on the obtained sensitivity indices of ECs, a mathematical model is established to simultaneously optimize the values of the platform and the non-platform ECs. Finally, by comparing and analysing the optimal solutions with different number of platform ECs, the ECs with which the worst OCS loss can be avoided are selected as platform ECs. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. A comparison between the proposed method and a two-step approach is conducted on the example. The comparison shows that, as a kind of single-stage approach, the proposed method yields better average degree of customer satisfaction due to the simultaneous optimization of platform and non-platform ECs.

A main competitive advantage for many companies {{is the ability}} to bring the products to market faster. An effective method to get the advantage is to develop product platforms. This thesis develops a methodology to assist companies in creating product platforms quickly and efficiently. The thesis focuses on building <b>a</b> model for <b>scalable</b> <b>product</b> platforms and developing a framework for the <b>Scalable</b> <b>Product</b> Platform Based Robust Design since there are many researches on module-based product platform and no systematic framework for <b>scalable</b> <b>product</b> platform. In the methodology, the two-stage approach, multiple-objectives, compromise decision support problem (compromise DSP), and robust design are integrated to build the decision model. The model consists of eight steps that describe how to formulate the problem and how it can be solved. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|Ontologies are {{becoming}} extremely useful tools for sophisticated software engineering. Designing applications, databases, and knowledge bases {{with reference to}} a common ontology can mean shorter development cycles, easier and faster integration with other software and content, and <b>a</b> more <b>scalable</b> <b>product.</b> Although ontologies are a very promising solution {{to some of the}} most pressing problems that confront software engineering, they also raise some issues and difficulties of their own. Consider, for example, the questions below: •	How can a formal ontology be used effectively by those who lack extensive training in logic and mathematics? •	How can an ontology be used automatically by applications (e. g. Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing applications) that process free text? • How can we know when an ontology is complete? In this paper we will begin by describing the upper- level ontology SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology), which has been proposed as the initial version of an eventual Standard Upper Ontology (SUO). We will then describe the popular, free, and structured WordNet lexical database. After this preliminary discussion, we will describe the methodology that we are using to align WordNet with the SUMO. We close this paper by discussing how this alignment of WordNet with SUMO will provide answers to the questions posed above...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of scientific problem solving on {{policy makers and}} the general public is a direct function of the perceived relevance and clarity of communication output. However environmental modelling is complex and this diminishes the ability of traditional media to clearly represent model output. Simplified brochures and news articles struggle to convey the complexity of the network of abiotic and biotic interdependent systems. Conversely detailed reports and scientific papers are rarely read. The optimum delivery of science involves the viewer dynamically determining the level of detail for a topic of interest. Static media such as newspapers and non-digital television have no provision for information expansion. This paper presents a knowledge management model focusing on integrating GIS into dynamic web pages to deliver <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> information <b>product.</b> The web site called www. ReefFutures. org uses dynamically generated web pages (Coldfusion) to incorporate GIS (ArcIMS). Using textual search engines (Verity) within a highly graphical and dynamic website permits the viewer to fully explore a topic of interest. The interactive mapping technologies permit the viewer to zoom in and fully investigate the scientific complexities surrounding an environmental issue. For many viewers {{this will be the first}} time to examine the raw data used by scientists. The first issue being addressed is coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. Spatial data depicting recent coral surveys can be viewed in the full context of satellite derived sea surface temperatures. Hyperlinking offers a mechanism of connecting images of the corals from surveys to the map elements with metadata describing various modelling techniques used. The ability to deliver complex modelling results through a sophisticated communication delivery mechanism will significantly enhance the {{influence of}} science...|$|R

40|$|Control of mosquito-borne {{diseases}} {{is greatly}} compromised by spread of insecticide resistance, high implementation costs and sub-optimal compliance among users. Improved housing has potential to reduce malaria transmission {{nearly as much}} as long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), while also preventing other arthropod-borne diseases and improving overall well-being. Yet, it is hardly promoted as mainstream intervention, partly because of high costs, minimal communal benefits to people in non-improved houses, and low scalability. By exploiting biological observations of mosquito behaviours around dwellings, scientists have developed a new approach that integrates effective vector control into housing developments. The technique involves blocking eave spaces in local houses, leaving a few cylindrical holes into which plastic tubes with insecticide-laden electrostatic nettings are inserted. Where houses already have blocked eaves, these cylindrical holes are drilled and the tubes inserted. The eave tube technology, as it is called, is an innovative new approach for implementing housing improvements, by creating <b>a</b> new <b>scalable</b> <b>product</b> that can be integrated in houses during or after construction. It takes away insecticides from proximity of users, and instead puts them where mosquitoes are most likely to enter houses, thereby reducing insecticidal exposure among household occupants, while maximizing exposure of mosquitoes. This way, lower quantities of insecticides are used, better house ventilation achieved, intervention costs reduced, and mass communal benefits achieved even were vectors are resistant to similar insecticides when delivered conventionally. There are however still some critical pieces missing, notably epidemiological, social and economic evidence that the above assertions are true and sustainable. Besides, there also some technical limitations to be considered, namely: (1) need for extensive house modifications before eave tubes are inserted, (2) ineligibility of poorest and highest-risk households living in housing structures not amenable to eave tubes, and (3) poor synergies when eave tubes are combined with LLINs or IRS in same households. Overall, this paradigm significantly improves delivery of insecticides against disease-transmitting mosquitoes, and provides opportunities for scaling-up the long-neglected concept of house improvement as a malaria intervention...|$|R

40|$|Frequent {{packet loss}} of media data is a {{critical}} problem that degrades the quality of streaming services over mobile networks. Packet loss invalidates frames containing lost packets and other related frames at the same time. Indirect loss caused by losing packets decreases the quality of streaming. <b>A</b> <b>scalable</b> streaming service can decrease the amount of dropped multimedia resulting from a single packet loss. Content providers typically divide one large media stream into several layers through <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> streaming service and then provide each scalable layer to the user depending on the mobile network. Also, <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> streaming service {{makes it possible to}} decode partial multimedia data depending on the relationship between frames and layers. Therefore, <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> streaming service provides a way to decrease the wasted multimedia data when one packet is lost. However, the hierarchical structure between frames and layers of scalable streams determines the service quality of the scalable streaming service. Even if whole packets of layers are transmitted successfully, they cannot be decoded {{as a result of the}} absence of reference frames and layers. Therefore, the complicated relationship between frames and layers in <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> stream increases the volume of abandoned layers. For providing <b>a</b> high-quality <b>scalable</b> streaming service, we choose a proper relationship between scalable layers as well as the amount of transmitted multimedia data depending on the network situation. We prove that <b>a</b> simple <b>scalable</b> scheme outperforms <b>a</b> complicated scheme in an error-prone network. We suggest an adaptive set-top box (AdaptiveSTB) to lower the dependency between <b>scalable</b> layers in <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> stream. Also, we provide a numerical model to obtain the indirect loss of multimedia data and apply it to various multimedia streams. Our AdaptiveSTB enhances the quality of <b>a</b> <b>scalable</b> streaming service by removing indirect loss...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Older acute {{myeloid leukemia}} (AML) {{patients}} have a poor prognosis; therefore, novel therapies are needed. Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells have been adoptively transferred with promising clinical results. Here, we report the first-in-human study exploiting <b>a</b> unique <b>scalable</b> NK-cell <b>product</b> generated ex vivo from CD 34 + hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from partially HLA-matched umbilical cord blood units. Experimental Design: Ten older AML patients in morphologic complete remission received an escalating HSPC-NK cell dose (between 3 and 30 x 106 /kg body weight) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy without cytokine boosting. Results: HSPC-NK cell products contained a median of 75 % highly activated NK cells, with < 1 x 104 T cells/kg and < 3 x 105 B cells/kg body weight. HSPC-NK cells were well tolerated, and neither graft-versus-host disease nor toxicity was observed. Despite no cytokine boosting being given, transient HSPC-NK cell persistence was clearly found in peripheral blood up to 21 % until day 8, which was accompanied by augmented IL 15 plasma levels. Moreover, donor chimerism up to 3. 5 % was found in bone marrow. Interestingly, in vivo HSPC-NK cell maturation was observed, indicated by the rapid acquisition of CD 16 and KIR expression, while expression of most activating receptors was sustained. Notably, 2 of 4 patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow before infusion became MRD negative (< 0. 1 %), which lasted for 6 months. Conclusions: These findings indicate that HSPC-NK cell adoptive transfer is a promising, potential "off-the-shelf" translational immunotherapy approach in AML. Clin Cancer Res; 23 (15); 4107 - 18.
