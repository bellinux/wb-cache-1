40|$|Down-core {{variations}} of granulometric, geochemical and mineral magnetism of a 70 -cm long sedi-ment core retrieved {{from the eastern}} Bay of Bengal <b>abyssal</b> <b>region</b> were studied to understand sedimentation pattern and sediment provenance during the last ∼ 12 kyr BP. Based on down-core physical and elemental variations, three units were identified: unit 3 (70 – 43 cm) is a ∼ 30 cm thick clayey silt organic carbon-rich (0. 5 – 0. 92 %) turbidite probably delivered by the Brahmaputra River during the late Quaternary period. Units 2 (43 – 24 cm) and 1 (24 – 0 cm) represent enhanced and reduced supply of coarse-grained detrital sediments from the Ganges River during early and late Holocene period, respectively. Increased terrigenous supply dilutes calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and biogenic elements (P, Ba and Cu) in units 3 and 2. On the contrary, a reduction in detrital input enhances CaCO 3 and biogenic elements in unit 1. Lithogenic elements (Ti, Al, K and Rb) and shale-normalized REE patterns in all three units suggest terrigenous source. The shift in provenance from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges derived sediments is evident by {{a sharp increase in}} sediment grain size, increased concentration and grain size assemblages of magnetic minerals, lithogenic elements concentration and Lan/Ybn ratio. This study highlights terrigenous dilution on biogenic sedimentation in the eastern Bay of Bengal sediments. 1...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{physics of the}} Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and interhemispheric heat transport is explored {{with an emphasis on}} the upper and central ocean. Sea surface temperature and wind stress are considered {{in the context of their}} ability to influence the MOC pattern and their relative significance is quantified. Most calculations in this study use an idealized rectangular basin which makes it easier to identify the key dynamic processes and explain interaction. Volumetric and advective heat transport streamfunctions are used to analyze interhemispheric exchanges of mass and energy. Data concerning the effects of equatorially-asymmetric wind stress and surface heat flux forcing are used to construct expressions which explicitly define the relationships between wind stress, surface heat flux, interhemispheric volume flow, and heat transport. The relative importance of wind stress and surface heat flux to the overall values of transport is discussed in light of climatology. The meridional overturning circulation in the upper ocean is found to be the dominant factor in interhemispheric heat transport and in the maintenance of the Earth's climate despite its extremely small contribution to total meridional-vertical circulations in the entire ocean basin. This study suggests that the previous emphasis on deep overturning in the <b>abyssal</b> <b>region</b> and small-scale mixing as the dominant factors in the meridional overturning circulation should be reconsidered and the role of wind stress and surface heat fluxes more thoroughly investigated as determining factors of MOC strength and maintenance. This study explores possible mechanisms responsible for climate shift which could result in long-term changes to weather patterns and ocean conditions altering important factors in the Navy's operating environment. Thus, long-term Navy planning must include an appreciation for possible changes in the forcing mechanisms responsible for the meridional overturning circulation.

40|$|Benthic {{microbial}} respiration and diffusive {{oxygen uptake}} were measured, {{and used to}} calculate rates of aerobic mineralization of organic matter and concomitant CO 2 production at the sediment water interface in the <b>abyssal</b> <b>region</b> of the Crozet Basin. This study {{was part of the}} ANTARES-I cruise on the R. V. Marion Dufresne, in the Permanent Open Ocean Zone of the Southern Ocean on a south to north transect from 52 °to 42 °S in the Indian Ocean. At all stations, oxygen penetrated much deeper than 10 cm. Aerobic respiration was maximal in the top 1 cm (10 - 96 nmol cm- 3 day- 1), was always detectable down to 5 cm depth, and at some stations even to 10 cm depth. Total depth-integrated oxygen consumption corresponded to within ± 25 % of the diffusive oxygen uptake across the sediment water interface. The shape of the profile indicated that a diffusive downward flow of oxygen occured below 10 cm depth. Thymidine incorporation experiments suggested that bacteria, present at depths of between 15 am and 1 m in the sediment, were in a dormant state or growing extremely slowly. However, rapid DNA-synthesis started within 4 h after thymidine was added, indicating a deep bacterial biosphere in Southern Ocean sediments. It is proposed that the diffusive downward flux of oxygen below 10 cm depth sustains aerobic bacterial metabolism and survival at greater depths. Along the transect, the total depth-integrated oxygen uptake peaked at 48 °S close to the Polar Front, and at the Subantarctic and Subtropical Convergence Frontal Zone. Nevertheless, in general, the differences were not very pronounced. The average value of depth-integrated microbial O 2 -consumption was 0. 61 mmol m- 2 day- 1, which is equivalent to a carbon mineralization rate of 2. 3 g Cm- 2 year- 1. These observations, together with relatively high Electron Transport System (ETS) -values (6. 6 μl 02 g- 1 h- 1) and bacterial numbers (4 x 109 g- 1 dry weight) in the top centimeter, imply that this region is less oligotrophic than previously assumed.

40|$|The thermohaline {{circulation}} (THC) and the oceanic heat and freshwater transports {{are essential for}} understanding the global climate system. Streamfunctions are widely used in oceanography to represent the THC and estimate the transport of heat and freshwater. In the present study, the regional and global changes of the THC, the transports of heat and freshwater and the timescale of the circulation between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ≈ 21 kyr ago) and the present-day climate are explored using an Ocean General Circulation Model and streamfunctions projected in various coordinate systems. We found that the LGM tropical circulation is about 10 % stronger than under modern conditions due to stronger wind stress. Consequently, the maximum tropical transport of heat is about 20 % larger during the LGM. In the North Atlantic basin, the large sea-ice extent during the LGM constrains the Gulf Stream to propagate in a more zonal direction, reducing the transport of heat towards high latitudes by almost 50 % and reorganising the freshwater transport. The strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation depends strongly on the coordinate system. It varies between 9 and 16 Sv during the LGM, and between 12 to 19 Sv for the present day. Similar to paleo-proxy reconstructions, a large intrusion of saline Antarctic Bottom Water takes place into the Northern Hemisphere basins and squeezes most of the Conveyor Belt circulation into a shallower part of the ocean. These different haline regimes between the glacial and interglacial period are illustrated by the streamfunctions in latitude–salinity coordinates and thermohaline coordinates. From these diagnostics, {{we found that the}} LGM Conveyor Belt circulation is driven by an enhanced salinity contrast between the Atlantic and the Pacific basin. The LGM abyssal circulation lifts and makes the Conveyor Belt cell deviate from the <b>abyssal</b> <b>region,</b> resulting in a ventilated upper layer above a deep stagnant layer, and an Atlantic circulation more isolated from the Pacific. An estimate of the timescale of the circulation reveals a sluggish abyssal circulation during the LGM, and a Conveyor Belt circulation that is more vigorous due to the combination of a stronger wind stress and a shortened circulation route...|$|E

Nevertheless, a decrease in abundance with increasing water depth as well as regional differences in abundance and community structure were detectable. Foraminiferans were by far the predominant taxon (58 - 86 %), followed by nematodes (10 - 27 %). Except for harpacticoids all other meiofauna taxa occurred just in low densities and very patchy. Very low meiofaunal abundances and a visible trend towards miniaturisation of organisms may be an outcome of the extremely limited food supply to the benthos under perennial ice-coverage of the central Arctic Ocean...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of living (rose Bengal stained) fora-miniferal species along three U. S. East Coast submarine canyons was investigated {{to determine if}} any populations were restricted to narrow ranges of water depth or spe-cific canyon subenvironments. Thirty samples were col-lected from eleven sites (ranging from 1438 to 2500 m water depth) along Wilmington, South Wilmington, North and South Heyes canyons during dives of the DSRV Alvin. Percent abundance data of foraminiferal species in each sample were analyzed using Q-mode clus-ter analysis. The species composition of each cluster group was examined by calculating occurrence (O), con-stancy (C), and biofacies fidelity (BF). Species diversity measures H(S) and E were also determined. These anal-yses show that live benthic foraminifera have broad, depth-related distribution patterns. Three main groups were identified. The abyssal realm is discriminated from the lower bathyal realm by variations in ubiquitous spe-cies proportions and {{by the presence of}} several rarely occurring species in abyssal samples. The shallower and deeper portions of the lower bathyal realm can be sep-arated but only by varying proportions of species. No canyon subenvironments that we sampled have distinc-tive living faunas.

The steep and sloping topography intensifies internal waves that dissipate energy directly by friction at the boundary and indirectly when they are reflected and break distant from the boundary. Although bottom boundary layers (BBL) on continental slopes and <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> have been described, deep continental boundary layers are poorly understood. This study examined along-canyon variability in BBL thicknesses and whether BBL heights were related to previously identified regions of high energy dissipation. Temporal variations in BBL thickness were also studied to see if significant variability was associated with an internal tide phase. In August and September 2008, we collected profiles at multiple stations along the Monterey Bay Canyon axis. Measurements included conductivity, temperature and depth (CTD), expendable current profiler (XCP), lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP), and vertical microstructure profiler (VMP) profiles of turbulent mixing. BBL heights varied spatially and temporally. BBLs were typically thicker in deeper waters near the Monterey Bend and the canyon mouth; however, heights were not closely in phase with the internal tide. Although turbulence extended 200 - 300 m above the seafloor, bottom mixed layers were thin or absent. This suggests that stratification and internal tidal oscillations limit the growth of BBLs in the canyon...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{delivery}} to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> {{of the oceans}} is an integral process in the source to sink cycle of material derived from adjacent continents and islands. The Zambezi River, the largest in southern Africa, delivers vast amounts of material to the inner continental shelf of central Mozambique. The aim of this contribution is to better constrain sediment transport pathways to the abyssal plains using the latest, regional, high-resolution multibeam bathymetry data available, {{taking into account the}} effects of bottom water circulation, antecedent basin morphology and sea-level change. Results show that sediment transport and {{delivery to}} the abyssal plains is partitioned into three distinct domains; southern, central and northern. Sediment partitioning is primarily controlled by changes in continental shelf and shelf-break morphology under the influence of a clockwise rotating shelf circulation system. However, changes in sealevel have an overarching control on sediment delivery to particular domains. During highstand conditions, such as today, limited sediment delivery to the submarine Zambezi Valley and Channel is proposed, with increased sediment delivery to the deepwater basin being envisaged during regression and lowstand conditions. However, there is a pronounced along-strike variation in sediment transport during the sea-level cycle due to changes in the width, depth and orientation of the shelf. This combination of features outlines a sequence stratigraphic concept not generally considered in the strike-aligned shelf-slope-abyssal continuum...|$|R

The flux maxima during the South-West (June-September) and the North-East Monsoon (December-March) {{are some of the}} highest particle fluxes recorded with deep-sea sediment traps in the open ocean. Benthic microbial biomass and activities in surface sediments were measured {{for the first time in}} March 1995 subsequent to the NE-monsoon and in October 1995 subsequent to the SW-monsoon. These measurements were repeated in April/May 1997 and February/March 1998, at a total of six stations from 1920 to 4420 m water depth. This paper presents a summary on the regional and temporal variability of microbial biomass, production, enzyme activity, degradation of 14 C-labeled Synechococcus material as well as sulfate reduction in the northern, western, eastern, central and southern Arabian deep sea. We found a substantial regional variation in microbial biomass and activity, with highest values in the western Arabian Sea (station WAST), decreasing approximately threefold to the south (station SAST). Benthic microbial biomass and activity during the NE-monsoon was as high or higher than subsequent to the SW-monsoon, indicating a very rapid turnover of POC in the surface sediments. This variation in the biomass and activity of the microbial assemblages in the Arabian deep sea can largely be explained by the regional and temporal variation in POC flux.

40|$|Phytoplankton {{blooms in}} surface {{waters of the}} oceans are known to {{influence}} the food web and impact microbial as well as zooplankton communities. Numerous studies have investigated the fate of phytoplankton-derived organic matter in surface waters and shelf sediments, however, {{little is known about}} the effect of sinking algal biomass on microbial communities in deep-sea sediments. Here, we analyzed sediments of four regions in the Southern Atlantic Ocean along the Antarctic Polar Front that had different exposures to phytoplankton bloom derived organic matter. We investigated the microbial communities in these sediments using high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA molecules to determine microorganisms that were active and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization to infer their abundance and distribution. The sediments along the Antarctic Polar Front harbored microbial communities that were highly diverse and contained microbial clades that seem to preferably occur in regions of high primary productivity. We showed that organisms affiliated with the gammaproteobacterial clade NOR 5 /OM 60, which is known from surface waters and coastal sediments, thrive in the deep-sea. Benthic deep-sea NOR 5 were abundant, diverse, distinct from pelagic NOR 5 and likely specialized on the degradation of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, occupying a similar niche as their pelagic relatives. Algal detritus seemed to not only fuel the benthic microbial communities of large areas in the deep-sea, but also to influence communities locally, as we found a peak in Flavobacteriaceae-related clades that also include degraders of algal biomass. The results strongly suggest that phytoplankton-derived organic matter was rapidly exported to the deep-sea, nourished distinct benthic microbial communities and seemed to be the main energy source for microbial life in the seafloor of vast <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> along the Antarctic Polar Front. ...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{delivery}} to the <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> {{of the oceans}} is an integral process in the source to sink cycle of material derived from the hinterland. How sediments are transported down-slope, {{and where they are}} deposited has implications for the mass balance of the upper lithosphere, hydrocarbon reserves, climate archives and sequence stratigraphic models. The Zambezi River, the largest in southern Africa, delivers vast amounts of material to the continental shelf, submarine Sofala/Zambesia Bank. The Sofala/Zambesia Bank acts as a staging area for this riverine input prior to its redistribution toward the abyssal plains of the Mozambique Channel. Much of this material is said to be directed into the submarine Zambezi Valley and Channel. Until this study, however, the sediment transfer routes between the Sofala/Zambesia Bank and abyssal plains of the Mozambique Channel have been quite poorly understood and remain unconstrained. The aim of this contribution is to better constrain sediment transport pathways to the abyssal plains using the latest, regional, high resolution multibeam bathymetry data available, taking into account the effects of bottom water circulation, antecedent basin morphology and sea level change. Results show that sediment transport and {{delivery to}} the abyssal plains is discreetly partitioned into southern, central and northern domains. This sediment partitioning is primarily controlled by changes in continental shelf and shelf break morphology under the influence of a dynamic anticyclonic inshore circulation system. However, changes in base level have an overarching control on sediment delivery to particular domains at various sea levels. A direct consequence of these controlling factors is limited sediment delivery to the submarine Zambezi Valley and Channel under present-day conditions, with increased activity envisaged during regression. Furthermore, the “on-off” switching of discrete domains along strike is a sequence stratigraphic concept generally not previously considered in the shelf-slope-abyssal continuum. The proposed sediment transport routes, under varied sea level scenarios, provide a framework which relates shallow to mid depth studies with those focused on the deep regions of the Mozambique Channel providing the first inclusive account of shelf to abyssal sediment transport in the region...|$|R
40|$|Manganese nodules were {{collected}} during cruise 13 / 2 of R. V. Valdivia in 1976 {{in a small}} area of the equatorial north Pacific characterized by abyssal hill topography. The sediments are dominantly siliceous oozes in which extensive dissolution ofsiliceous material has taken place. Three principal nodule morphologies were recovered: polynucleate nodules, mononucleate nodules, and manganese crusts. Polynucleate nodules occur throughout the entire depth range studied whereas mononucleate nodules are found principally below 5000 m; manganese crusts are restricted to the abyssal hill environments. Nodule density remains on average roughly constant (> 7 kg/m 2) with water depth (although varying considerably, 0 - 27 kg/m 2, throughout the area), but the form in which the nodules occur changes with water depth. Nodule composition was investigated {{as a function of}} water depth, nodule size, and nodule morphology and shown to be related principally to nodule morphology. Mononucleate nodules have higher contents of Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn and lower contents of Fe and Co than polynucleate nodules. The lithogenous fraction in the nodules is similar in both morphologies, although it varies considerably with nodule size. Both morphologies contain todorokite andJ-Mn 02 as the principal manganese oxide phases, but todorokite is relatively more abundant in the mononucleate nodules. The data are best interpreted in terms of the diagenetic supply of the transition elements Mn, Ni, Cu, and Zn to the nodules resulting from the in situ dissolution of siliceous tests in the sediment column. This process is more pronounced in the <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> than on the flanks of the abyssal hills and leads to the enrichment of these elements in the larger mononucleate nodules embedded at the sediment -water interface there. This enhanced supply of transition elements also leads to the stabilization of todorokite in these nodules. Polynucleate nodules appear to be preferentially formed under conditions of higher sedimentation rate on the flanks of abyssal hills in an environment where abundant seeds are available. Mononucleate nodules are formed in abyssal environments characterized by lower sedimentation rate where enhanced rates of supply of biogenically derived elements can take place...|$|R
40|$|Surface samples, {{mostly from}} abyssal sediments of the South Atlantic, from {{parts of the}} {{equatorial}} Atlantic, and of the Antarctic Ocean, were investigated for clay content and clay mineral composition. Maps of relative clay mineral content were compiled, which improve previous maps by showing more details, especially at high latitudes. Large-scale relations regarding the origin and transport paths of detrital clay are revealed. High smectite concentrations are observed in <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions,</b> primarily derived from southernmost South America and from minor sources in Southwest Africa. Near submarine volcanoes of the Antarctic Ocean (South Sandwich, Bouvet Island) smectite contents exhibit distinct maxima, which is ascribed to the weathering of altered basalts and volcanic glasses. The illite distribution can be subdivided into five major zones including two maxima revealing both South African and Antarctic sources. A particularly high amount of Mg- and Fe-rich illites are observed close to East Antarctica. They are derived from biotite-bearing crystalline rocks and transported to the west by the East Antarctic Coastal Current. Chiorite and well-crystallized dioctaedral illite are typical minerals enriched within the Subantarctic and Polarfrontal-Zone but of minor importance off East Antarctica. Kaolinite dominates the clay mineral assemblage at low latitudes, where the continental source rocks (West Africa, Brazil) are mainly affected by intensive chemical weathering. Surprisingly, a slight increase of kaolinite is observed in the Enderby Basin and near the Filchner-Ronne Ice shelf. The investigated area can be subdivided into ten, large-scale clay facies zones with characteristic possible source regions and transport paths. Clay mineral assemblages of the largest part of the South Atlantic, especially of the western basins are dominated by chlorite and illite derived from the Antarctic Peninsula and southernmost South America and supported by advection within the Circumantarctic Deep Water flow. In contrast, the East Antarctic provinces are relatively small. Assemblages of the eastern basins north of 30 °S are strongly influenced by African sources, controlled by weathering regimes on land and by a complex interaction of wind, river and deep ocean transport.

One representative PRA should be placed in each of nine subregions of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone defined by productivity gradients and faunal turnover (Figure 2).

40|$|Determining the {{distribution}} and abundance of life is challenging, especially in the deep sea where high pressure and other logistical challenges limit data availability to {{a tiny fraction of}} what is available for other systems. Most of Earth’s surface is nonetheless covered by water > 2000 m deep. Life in these <b>abyssal</b> <b>regions</b> influences the burial of carbon and nutrient cycling. Long-term research has now shown that even larger animals in the deep sea can vary in density by orders of magnitude, with concurrent changes in average body size, over periods as short as months. These variations are widely believed to be linked to climate-driven variation in the food supply to the deep sea. Similarly, biogeography studies have found that over distances approaching 100 km or more, the abundance of deep-sea life is related to surface productivity in the waters above. Thus the deep sea could be readily impacted by processes that alter surface ocean conditions like climate change, fishery activity, or ocean iron fertilisation. While there has been an increase in the understanding of how climate and surface processes affect deep-sea communities, the ability to understand these links further is thought to be limited by sampling error from undetected habitat heterogeneity (i. e. irregular or uneven habitat distributions). Features like hills, valleys, depressions, small rock outcrops, and biogenic mounds add to habitat complexity, but links between such features and the animals that live among them are very poorly resolved in abyssal plain habitats using current methods. We proposed a new approach using the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Autosub 6000 to survey ecologically the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) Sustained Observatory to address a key question: Are spatial patterns in abyssal habitat features (like bathymetry, seafloor cover of phytodetrius [i. e. food availability], suspended solid concentration) related to spatial patterns in photographed life (density, dispersion, or biodiversity) at spatial scales from < 1 m^ 2 to about 100 km^ 2 ? Objectives 1. 	We created high-resolution ecological maps at scales of < 1 m^ 2 to 100 km^ 2. 2. 	We will then test tractable hypotheses focusing on if any observed faunal distributions are linked with the spatial patterns of other fauna, habitat, food availability, or environmental conditions. 3.

We investigate the feasibility of nematodes as biomonitoring organisms and give information about their natural biodiversity. Results The taxonomic composition (at family to genus level) of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar, but not identical to, the North Atlantic. Given the immature state of marine nematode taxonomy, {{it is not possible to}} comment on the commonality or otherwise of species between oceans. The between basin differences do not appear to be directly linked to current ecological factors. The <b>abyssal</b> Pacific <b>region</b> (including the Fracture Zone) could be divided into two biodiversity subregions that conform to variations in the linked factors of flux to the benthos and of sedimentary characteristics. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic-carbon flux.

The variational method is also {{used in the study}} of the dynamics of the deep sea currents., The deep sea currents in the coastal region of the northeast Pacific can be calculated approximately by solving the linearized equations for long waves in shallow basins. Both the perturbation and the variational methods are employed to solve these equations in the case of step shelf models approximating the shelf contours in the region. It is concluded that the perturbation method using the Fourier transform technique is to be preferred for the problem at Redacted for Privacy hand. The results show that the topography of the continental shelf and the continental slope has only a minor effect on the deep sea currents in the <b>abyssal</b> plain <b>region.</b> In the case of the D. C. conduction exploration method, the perturbation method is applied both to the problem of computing the surface potential due to a given conductivity distribution and also to the inverse problem of interpreting given field data. The first case involves the solving of an ordinary second order differential equation by numerical methods followed by a numerical Uankel transformation. The inversion procedure involves, in particular, the numerical inversion of a Laplace transformation. The applica-tion of these methods to two- and three-layer cases is demonstrated by working out some examples. It is shown that the perturbation method can be applied with good results provided certain conditions are satisfied.

Above this a layer of warm, high salinity Mediterranean-derived water was identified and it is suggested that bioluminescent organisms were trapped below this layer due to its physical properties. Static benthic studies examined the distribution of organisms that emitted bioluminescence, without extrinsic stimulation, in the presence of bait.   Of the eleven deployment locations, one site (ca. 51 ° 10 ’N, 11 ° 40 ’W) recorded an average of 3. 52 bioluminescent events per minute, compared to 0. 37 events at other locations (at depths from 970 m- 4000 m).   At this bioluminescent hotspot, organisms attracted into the field of view did not include known luminous species.   This suggested the involvement of small epibenthic or infaunal organisms that produced light as a defensive reaction to the activity of organisms at bait. The difficulty in maintaining deep-sea organisms in a laboratory has limited the study of the ecological function of bioluminescent emissions.   To investigate the use of bioluminescent emissions as intraspecific signals, studies were performed in the laboratory with shallow water bioluminescent ophiuroids (Amphiura filiformis).   The emissions were initiated by chemical stimulation and were associated with limb autonomy, typical of a defensive response.   No evidence was found for the use of bioluminescence as an intraspecific signal.

40|$|The meiobenthos (including foraminiferans) of the Molloy Deep (Fram Strait, Arctic Ocean) was studied along a 15 km {{transect}} {{crossing the}} deep in NW-SE direction. Four stations between 5416 and 5569 m water depth were sampled during summer months between 1997 and 2001. In {{comparison with other}} <b>abyssal</b> and hadal <b>regions</b> of the World Ocean, meiofauna abundances were extremely high, ranging from 2153 to 2968 ind. / 10 cm² (values for the uppermost 5 cm of the sediments). The analysis of biogenic sediment compounds (e. g. chloroplastic pigments, particulate proteins) confirmed comparably high amounts of organic matter in the sediments, presumably favouring increased faunal densities and biomasses. Subsurface peaks in meiobenthic abundances at 1 - 2 cm sediment depth are most probably due to substantial disturbance and/or predation by dense herds of small holothurians (Elpidia glacialis), obviously inhabiting the entire Molloy Deep in very high numbers. Faunal composition of the meiobenthic community of the Molloy Deep was similar to other deep-sea regions. Foraminiferans were the dominant taxa of the total meiobenthos (48. 5 - 59. 9 %), whereas nematodes dominated the metazoan meiofauna (91. 7 - 95. 8 %). The total meiofauna of the Molloy Deep consisted of relatively small organisms compared to other/shallower oceanic regions, {{which could not be}} explained by reduced food availability to the benthos...|$|R
40|$|The ichthyofauna {{of ocean}} margin regions is characterised by a {{succession}} of different species occurring at different depths. This study was aimed at determining whether the resultant pattern of species richness with depth {{is a consequence of}} local factors in a given region or whether it simply reflects the global pattern of fish species distribution in the oceans. Along the ocean margin of the temperate NE Atlantic Ocean in the Porcupine Seabight and <b>Abyssal</b> Plain <b>region,</b> 48 °- 53 °N, a total of 108 demersal fish species were identified from 187 trawls at depths from 240 to 4865 m. Fitting of species accumulation curves predicted an asymptote of 120, indicating that the fauna is 90 % described. Baited cameras detected 22 scavenging species with a predicted asymptote of 24 species. Scavenging species represented a constant 22. 7 % (SD 3. 5 %) of the total species richness throughout the depth range studied. Species richness per trawl varied between a maximum of 16 at 1600 m and 4 on the abyssal plain > 4000 m with no significant influence of sea floor slope (a measure of topographic heterogeneity). Total species richness was 48 at 1600 m and 10 on the abyssal plain. There is a clear transition between slope species above 3000 m and abyssal species below. The depth at which peak species richness occurs (1100 - 2000 m) coincides with the depth of the permanent thermocline, presence of Mediterranean overflow water (MOW), seasonally strong currents, resuspension of particulate matter, high biomass of benthic filter feeders and pelagic biomass impinging on the slope. We suggest that these factors increase habitat and resource heterogeneity, thus supporting a wider range of fish species. The local pattern of species richness was compared with the global distribution of maximum depths of marine fish species from FishBase. Globally all three Classes of fishes, Agnatha, Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes, showed a logarithmic decrease in species with depth, with the deepest observed species in each class occurring at 3003 m, 4156 m and 8370 m, respectively. In contrast, the local distribution of species maximum depths is idiosyncratic with a mean of 16. 6 species maxima per 500 m at 1000 - 3000 m depth followed by three species per 500 m at 3500 - 4000 m and 11 species per 500 m at 5000 m. It is concluded that global patterns of species richness, as a source of recruitment, exert a weak influence on local patterns of species richness. Rather, global species richness is the sum of numerous regional and local patterns, each determined by characteristic environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe late {{stage of}} the North East Atlantic (NEA) spring bloom was {{investigated}} during June 2005 along a transect section from 45 to 66 ° N between 15 and 20 ° W in order to characterize the contribution of siliceous and calcareous phytoplankton groups and describe their distribution in relation to environmental factors. We measured several biogeochemical parameters such as nutrients, surface trace metals, algal pigments, biogenic silica (BSi), particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) or calcium carbonate, particulate organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (POC, PON and POP, respectively), as well as transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). Results were compared with other studies undertaken in this area since the JGOFS NABE program. Characteristics of the spring bloom generally agreed well with the accepted scenario {{for the development of}} the autotrophic community. The NEA seasonal diatom bloom was in the late stages when we sampled the area and diatoms were constrained to the northern part of our transect, over the Icelandic Basin (IB) and Icelandic Shelf (IS). Coccolithophores dominated the phytoplankton community, with a large distribution over the Rockall-Hatton Plateau (RHP) and IB. The Porcupine <b>Abyssal</b> Plain (PAP) <b>region</b> at the southern end of our transect was the region with the lowest biomass, as demonstrated by very low Chla concentrations and a community dominated by picophytoplankton. Early depletion of dissolved silicic acid (DSi) and increased stratification of the surface layer most likely triggered the end of the diatom bloom, leading to coccolithophore dominance. The chronic Si deficiency observed in the NEA could be linked to moderate Fe limitation, which increases the efficiency of the Si pump. TEP closely mirrored the distribution of both biogenic silica at depth and prymnesiophytes in the surface layer suggesting the sedimentation of the diatom bloom in the form of aggregates, but the relative contribution of diatoms and coccolithophores to carbon export in this area still needs to be resolved...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} mostly a {{synthesis}} of work conducted on the continental margin of the Gulf of Cádiz using a broad database collected by several cruises and projects supported by the Spanish Research Council and the NRL and Naval Oceanographic Office (USA), including: bathymetry, sidescan sonar imagery, seismic profiles, sediment cores, submarine photographs and physical oceanographic data. These data have enabled us to establish a detailed understanding of the morphologic development of the margin, its Pliocene and Quaternary stratigraphy, and a full characterization of the contourite depositional system (CDS) generated by the Mediterranean outflow water (MOW). The northern margin of the Gulf of Cádiz shows the following distinct features: (a) an active compressive framework where the “Cádiz Allocthonous Unit” provides an unstable substratum for Late Miocene, Pliocene and Quaternary sedimentation; (b) a relative lack of submarine canyons, except in the western area of the Algarve margin; (c) a very broad continental slope that lacks a marked continental rise; (d) a middle slope dominated by along-slope processes driven by the MOW, which has generated a complex CDS during the Pliocene and Quaternary; and (e) an irregular lower slope and <b>abyssal</b> plain <b>region</b> dominated by down-slope processes that is partly detached from an upper slope source region. The CDS is composed of both depositional and erosive features. The main depositional features are characterised by sedimentary wave fields, sedimentary lobes, mixed drifts, plastered drifts, elongated mounded, and separated drifts and sheeted drifts. The main erosive features are contourite channels, furrows, marginal valleys and moats. These various depositional and erosive features have a specific location along the margin, and their detailed distribution is essential to understand the present (and past) interaction of the MOW with the middle slope. Based on this distribution, five morphosedimentary sectors have been identified within the CDS, which {{from east to west}} are: (1) proximal scour and sand ribbons; (2) overflow sedimentary lobe; (3) channels and ridges; (4) active contourite drifts; and (5) submarine canyons. The development of the CDS has been controlled in general by the Pliocene and Quaternary environmental and paleoceanographic changes and by the morphology of the margin, but in detail the development of each of these sectors is related to systematic deceleration of the MOW as it flows westwards, to the interaction with the margin bathymetry, and to the effects of Coriolis force. Our comprehensive sedimentary model for the CDS defines the Gulf of Cádiz margin as a mixed contourite-turbidite system with a detached combined drift-fan morphology. This is different from many other contourite influenced margins, where the contourite processes are dominant on the middle slope, and separated from the down-slope processes, which are characteristic on the lower slope and abyssal plains. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{waves in}} the ocean are the {{principal}} generators of mixing in the <b>abyssal</b> ocean and <b>regions</b> of rough topography. The present research work diagnoses the influence of internal wave activity over the Continental slope in the Gulf of Cadiz. Mediterranean Outflow (MOW) and North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) are the main baroclinic flows over the study region and diapycnal mixing acts in each layer. Semi-diurnal internal tides and a continuous MOW flow are observed on the slope. The MOW flow is persistent reaching > 0. 40 ms- 1, but varies in strength with the tides. The Internal wave field in the Gulf of Cadiz {{can play an important}} role affecting the MOW signal over the continental slope; MOW can be displaced by the internal tide. Internal waves are generated by tides and MOW flow interacting with the bottom, the two most energetic sources locally. Also MOW bottom stress provides strong diapycnal mixing, providing well-mixed conditions in the MOW. Internal tides can transfer energy on the slope and can cause turbulence. A critical slope characteristic for semidiurnal internal waves occurs over the continental slope with local background stratification where MOW travels as an undercurrent. Diapycnal mixing is found to be enhanced inside the MOW with a diapycnal diffusivity O(7 x 10 - 4 m 2 s- 1), and at the MOW-NACW interfaces, reaching O(2 x 10 - 4 m 2 s- 1) for the upper interface and O(5 x 10 - 4 m 2 s- 1) for the lower interface. Fine-structure methods are used to estimate mixing using CTD measurements; however most of the records came from temperature profiles (XBTs) and an alternative approach to diagnose the strain uses temperature profiles with inferred salinity (using temperature-salinity relations from the CTDs). Applying the strain method using temperature with inferred salinity profiles provides a plausible approximation of the strain spectrum and the mixing estimates, with uncertainties similar to those diagnosed using CTD measurements. Mixing estimates are also diagnosed using a large scale box model, where a salinity budget is applied to study gain and loss over the Gulf of Cadiz. Box model results confirm that salinity is diapycnally transferred from the MOW layers into the neighbouring NACW layers. The advective and diffusive transfers of salt along the layer are much larger than the diapycnal transfer. The inferred diffusivities from the box model are broadly in accord with the estimates from strain...|$|R
