500|$|The song [...] "Talk Soup", {{which is}} about a man who desires to go on {{television}} to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E! Entertainment Television show of the same name. Although the producers approved the lyrics and enjoyed the final result, they decided against using it. [...] "Waffle King", the track that had been intended for Off the Deep End, was written as [...] "a song <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> becomes incredibly famous for doing something kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself way too seriously". Yankovic included [...] "Harvey the Wonder Hamster", a short tune from one of his Al TV appearances, after receiving numerous requests to include it on an album.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{track on}} the album, [...] "I'm Going Bananas", is a Carmen Miranda-ish song {{done in a}} Spanish accent. A salsa rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass. In the fifth track, [...] "Crybaby", Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop. The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is [...] "too sensitive and soft", and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track [...] "Something to Remember" [...] deals with her failed marriage to Penn and {{was the source of}} inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Everything" [...] {{is aimed}} at Zac Hanson, who Marion Raven dated briefly while M2M were on tour with Hanson. According to Raven, once the tour ended he never {{contacted}} her, effectively ending the relationship. The song [...] "Miss Popular" [...] is about [...] "that one popular girl in school who goes around bad-mouthing everyone" [...] then eventually [...] "it all comes back to her", while [...] "Jennifer" [...] is about wanting to dislike [...] "the girl your boyfriend is constantly comparing you to" [...] but {{not being able to}} as she is a nice person. Raven wrote the song [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> dumped her then wanted her back, and wrote the song [...] "Sometimes" [...] when she was having a really bad day and wanted to just [...] "get it out".|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Guevara's {{personality}} and beliefs affected the filming process. For instance, close-ups of Del Toro were avoided due to Guevara's belief in collectivism, with Soderbergh remarking, [...] "You can't {{make a movie}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has these hard-core sort of egalitarian socialist principles and then isolate him with close-ups." [...] According to Edgar Ramirez, who portrays Ciro Redondo, the cast [...] "were improvising a lot" [...] while making The Argentine, and he describes the project as a [...] "very contemplative movie", shot chronologically. While filming outdoors, Soderbergh used natural light as much as possible. Del Toro, who speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, tried to speak the best Argentinean Spanish (Rioplatense Spanish) he could without sounding [...] "stiff". Prior to shooting the film's final scenes that depict Guevara's time in Bolivia {{at the end of}} his life, Del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become. The actor shaved the top of his head rather than wear a bald cap for the scenes depicting Guevara's arrival in Bolivia in disguise.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{announced}} in January 2010 that actor Peter Weller had been {{cast in a}} guest starring role for an upcoming episode. Though he had normally kept his distance from episodic television because it [...] "burns [...] out" [...] and he was pursuing a Ph.D at UCLA, his wife, a big Fringe fan, read the script and convinced him to accept the part of Alistair Peck, telling him [...] "You've got to do this, it's beautiful, it's <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> wants to save his wife". During {{a conference call with}} journalists, Weller also cited the character's [...] "tremendously romantic and very moving" [...] storyline as another reason he accepted the part. He thought the four-page scripted scene between him and John Noble was [...] "rare for television [...] wonderfully written. I was thrilled to do [...] ". Weller has since become a fan of Fringe because of his work in the episode, and would love to return and direct for the show. In a later Twitter post, Wyman dismissed speculation and confirmed that Weller's character Alistair Peck did indeed die {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> gets an idea into his head. He picks it up off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Rutherford, {{the song}} is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> {{traveled}} light-years away, out in space somewhere, and he's ahead in time. Therefore he knows what's {{going to happen to}} his wife and kids back home, on Earth. And he's trying to get the message to them to say what's going to happen, the kind of anarchy, the breakdown of society, to tell them to be prepared.|$|R

He's waiting for revenge {{and wants to}} fuck that place up." [...] King later said that [...] "the rest of the song explains what happens when he starts fucking people up. The lyrics 'Return to power draws near' is because he's waiting to get strong enough again to overthrow Heaven. And then 'Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears' is everybody's blood flowing into him. So basically, 'Raining Blood' is all the angels' blood falling on him." ...|$|R

500|$|Though Reitman {{has claimed}} in countless {{interviews}} {{that he wrote}} the parts specifically for George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Melanie Lynskey, Amy Morton, Sam Elliott and Zach Galifianakis, some of the actors publicly stated their confusion in Reitman's assertion, if only because they knew he was meeting with other actors all along including his choice to fill his last lead role with Ellen Page (who starred in Reitman's previous film Juno) for the part that Kendrick ultimately played. On the part played by Farmiga, he cited her ability to walk {{a fine line between}} aggressiveness and femininity. On Kendrick, Reitman cited that he was inspired by her performance in Rocket Science. On Clooney, he said, [...] "If you're going to make a movie <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> fires people for a living and you still want to like him, that actor better be damn charming and I don't think there's a more charming actor alive than George Clooney. I was very lucky he said yes." [...] Reitman said, on the B.S. Report with Bill Simmons, that he considered Steve Martin for the part if Clooney declined the role. Reitman said that he would have changed the movie with Martin and given Martin [...] "his Lost in Translation." ...|$|E
500|$|Dinklage {{found his}} {{breakthrough}} playing Finbar McBride, {{who is a}} quiet, withdrawn, unmarried man in the 2003 Tom McCarthy-directed film The Station Agent. According to co-star Bobby Cannavale, the film took three years to make and was not at first written with Dinklage in mind, Cannavale said McCarthy [...] "set out {{to tell a story}} <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was a train enthusiast who had chosen to isolate himself from the world", but when McCarthy actually started [...] "putting pen to paper" [...] for the screenplay he decided to write the role for him. Speaking about the role, Dinklage noted that usually [...] "roles written for someone my size are a little flat"—often either comical or [...] "sort of Lord of the Rings" [...] type characters filled with wisdom; further: [...] "They're not sexual, they're not romantic" [...] and [...] "they're not flawed". What attracted him to the character McCarthy had written was that it was not one of the stereotypical roles people with dwarfism play; rather, McBride has [...] "romantic feelings" [...] as well as [...] "anger and ... flaws". The role earned him the Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor nominations. In the New York Observer, reviewer Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Dinklage projects both size and intelligence in the fascinating reticence of his face." [...] Besides being Dinklage's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Station Agent was modestly successful at the box office, earning over $8 million against its small budget.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{likened the}} episode to Seinfeld and Ellen; Tom Feran in The Plain Dealer wrote that it traded [...] "vaguely and less {{successfully}} on the hanging-out style of Seinfeld", and Ann Hodges of the Houston Chronicle called it [...] "the new Seinfeld wannabe, {{but it will}} never be as funny as Seinfeld. Even as Seinfeld is now, which isn't as funny as it used to be". Hodges criticized the [...] "stiflingly dull social circle" [...] as [...] "short to the point of painful in brainpower". Robert Bianco in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that the [...] "constant comic bantering grows a little tired, just as it would if it ever actually happened in real life", and questioned why the six characters had so much free time to talk about dates. In the Los Angeles Daily News, Ray Richmond, who had also seen the following two episodes, called the cast a [...] "likeable, youth ensemble" [...] with [...] "good chemistry". He added that while Friends was [...] "one of the brighter comedies of the new season", the pilot was [...] "very weak". Diane Holloway for the Austin American-Statesman questioned Friends billing as a [...] "sophisticated comedy", writing, [...] "What's sophisticated <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> dreams his penis is a telephone?" [...] She called the scene where Monica discovers Paul's impotence was a lie the least funny part of the episode, though conceded that the episode as a whole did have some funny moments. [...] Robert P. Laurence wrote in The San Diego Union-Tribune that [...] "A lot happens, but you'll still get the feeling you've seen Friends before", calling it [...] "Seinfeld Plus Two. Or Ellen Plus Five." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Ginny Holbert rated the episode three stars, and wrote [...] "The clever series [...] stars an appealing group of actors who are just a bit funnier and better-looking than your average friend" [...] but that Joey and Rachel's characteristics were under-developed.|$|E

500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
