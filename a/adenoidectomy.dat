25|$|Tonsillectomy and/or <b>adenoidectomy</b> in {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} the size of the airway.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called <b>adenoidectomy</b> (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). <b>Adenoidectomy</b> is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to treat is usually made after {{a combination of}} physical exam and laboratory diagnosis, with additional testing including audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion can resolve spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant <b>adenoidectomy.</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARYBackgroundThe {{laryngeal}} mask airway {{is a medical}} device that must be used with precise indications and contraindications. Its use in tonsillectomies and <b>adenoidectomies</b> {{has been reported to}} generate controversy. Through the present study an attempt is made to evaluate the effectiveness and the security of the {{laryngeal mask}} airway in tonsillectomies and <b>adenoidectomies.</b> Methods: A systematic review. Results: 16 studies were obtained {{as a result of the}} systematic search of the published evidence. They were analyzed with methodological rigor and the following results were obtained: The flexible laryngeal mask airway brings about fewer respiratory adverse effects during the induction and the emergence of anesthesia than the endotracheal tube. It is effective in preventing sanguineous bronchoaspiration during surgery. Furthermore, it must be used by trained personnel and in collaboration with the surgeon to avoid adverse events like displacement, obstruction or occupation of the operating field. Conclusions: the flexible laryngeal mask airway is a useful and safe alternative for the handling of the airways in tonsillectomies and <b>adenoidectomies</b> by its advantages in the induction and emergence of surgery since it triggers less protective reflections of the airway at the moment. In order to avoid intraoperating complications one must have experience in its use plus empathy must exist between the surgical team and the anesthesiologist...|$|R
25|$|On February 20, 2013, the FDA {{released}} a statement addressing a serious concern regarding the connection between children who are known as CYP2D6 UM and fatal reactions to codeine following tonsillectomy and/or <b>adenoidectomy</b> (surgery to remove the tonsils and/or adenoids). They released their strongest Boxed Warning to elucidate the dangers of CYP2D6 UMs consuming codeine. Codeine is converted to morphine by CYP2D6, {{and those who have}} UM phenotypes are at danger of producing large amounts of morphine due to the increased function of the gene. The morphine can elevate to life-threatening or fatal amounts, as became evident with the death of three children in August 2012.|$|E
2500|$|OSA in {{children}} is sometimes due to chronically enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Tonsillectomy and <b>adenoidectomy</b> are curative. The operation {{may be far}} from trivial, especially in the worst apnea cases, in which growth is retarded and abnormalities of the right heart may have developed. Even in these extreme cases, the surgery tends to cure not only the apnea and upper airway obstruction but allows normal subsequent growth and development. Once the high end-expiratory pressures are relieved, the cardiovascular complications reverse themselves. The postoperative period in these children requires special precautions (see [...] "Surgery and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome" [...] below).|$|E
2500|$|Although this {{so-called}} [...] "hypersomnolence" [...] (excessive sleepiness) may also occur in children, {{it is not}} at all typical of young children with sleep apnea. Toddlers and young children with severe OSA instead ordinarily behave as if [...] "over-tired" [...] or [...] "hyperactive." [...] Adults and children with very severe OSA also differ in typical body habitus. Adults are generally heavy, with particularly short and heavy necks. Young children, on the other hand, are generally not only thin but may have [...] "failure to thrive", where growth is reduced. Poor growth occurs for two reasons: the work of breathing is intense enough that calories are burned at high rates even at rest, and the nose and throat are so obstructed that eating is both tasteless and physically uncomfortable. OSA in children, unlike adults, is often caused by obstructive tonsils and adenoids and may sometimes be cured with tonsillectomy and <b>adenoidectomy.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this scoping review is to investigate quality of life (QoL) questionnaires available to pediatric patients following tonsillectomies with or without <b>adenoidectomies</b> for chronic infection or sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).

40|$|We {{conducted}} a study to determine the utilization level for ambulatory surgery and the proportions of specific procedures which could be performed in certain ambulatory settings in one community, Syracuse, New York, which has used this service extensively. It was estimated that, in 1983, 26. 9 surgery cases per 1, 000 population in Syracuse were performed in ambulatory settings. This level amounted to approximately 37 per cent of hospital-based surgery in the area. Analysis of surgery utilization in two hospital-integrated and freestanding ambulatory surgery facilities indicated that more than 95 per cent of myringotomies, tonsillectomies, and <b>adenoidectomies</b> as well as substantial proportions of carpal tunnel releases, lens extractions, sterilizations, circumcisions, and inguinal hernia repairs in these two facilities were performed in ambulatory settings. The availability of dedicated facilities and full-time staff produced higher utilization for these procedures in freestanding facilities. The utilization levels for individual procedures identified in the study can be employed in the planning of hospital-integrated and freestanding programs...|$|R
2500|$|More than 530,000 {{procedures}} are performed annually in {{children younger than}} 15 years in the United States. The current tonsillectomy [...] "rate" [...] is 0.53 per thousand children and 1.46 per thousand children for combined tonsillectomy and <b>adenoidectomy.</b> In the past decade, tonsillectomies have become increasingly low due to orders from the government; specifically by President Obama in 2009 where he commented on {{ear nose and throat}} doctors at a conference [...] "You come in and you’ve got a bad sore throat, or your child has a bad sore throat or has repeated sore throats.

50|$|Surgical {{removal of}} the {{adenoids}} is a procedure called <b>adenoidectomy.</b> Carried out through the mouth under a general anaesthetic, <b>adenoidectomy</b> involves the adenoids being curetted, cauterised, lasered, or otherwise ablated. <b>Adenoidectomy</b> is most often performed because of nasal obstruction, but is also performed to reduce middle ear infections and fluid (otitis media). The procedure is often carried {{out at the same}} time as a tonsillectomy, since the adenoids can be clearly seen and assessed by the surgeon at that time.|$|E
50|$|The {{indications}} for <b>adenoidectomy</b> are controversial. Widest agreement surrounds their removal for obstructive sleep apnea, usually {{combined with}} tonsillectomy. Even then, {{it has been}} observed that a significant percentage of the study population (18%) did not respond.There is also support for <b>adenoidectomy</b> in recurrent otitis media in children previously treated with tympanostomy tubes. Finally, the effectiveness of <b>adenoidectomy</b> in children with recurrent upper respiratory tract infections has been questioned with the outcome, in some studies, being no better than watchful waiting.|$|E
40|$|Introduction This paper {{presents}} available {{epidemiological data}} on number {{and types of}} surgeries of Waldeyer’s ring over a sixty-year period, {{as well as their}} interactions. Results Out of 80. 477 patients operated on in the period from December 1, 1939 to Dec 31, 1998, statistical survey included 56. 564 patients (Table 1). 26. 808 (46. 57 %) patients were operated in local anesthesia, 23. 833 (41. 40 %) under ether narcosis, and 6. 923 (12. 026 %) patients were operated on under general endotracheal anesthesia. 38. 846 (67. 48 %) tonsillectomies, 12. 864 (22. 34 %) tonsilloadenoidectomies and 5. 854 (10. 16 %) <b>adenoidectomies</b> were performed. Discussion The percentage of these surgeries is very high, but in the past ten years it has fallen below 50 %. General endotracheal anesthesia is being used at the Department since 1966, and ether anesthesia is not being used since 1991. We believe that the number of tonsillectomies is high, because it also includes surgeries performed under local anesthesia, in patients over ten years of age. However, we can conclude that anesthesiological procedures effectively followed trends of medical science...|$|R
40|$|Studies of mice {{suggest that}} pneumococcal proteins, {{including}} PspA, pneumolysin, PsaA, and CbpA, are promising vaccine candidates. To determine whether these proteins are good mucosal immunogens in humans, adenoidal lymphocytes from 20 {{children who had}} <b>adenoidectomies</b> were isolated and tested by ELISpot for antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs). Cells were also cultured for 7 days {{in the presence of}} a concentrated culture supernatant (CCS) from a type 14 strain of pneumococcus which contained secreted pneumococcal proteins, including PspA, pneumolysin, PsaA, and CbpA, and then tested by ELISpot. ELISpot assays done on freshly isolated cells detected ASCs to all four antigens in most children studied. However, there were differences both between antigens and between isotypes. The densities of immunoglobulin G (IgG) ASCs against both PsaA and CbpA were significantly higher than those of ASCs for PspA and PdB (pneumolysin toxoid B) (P 2 -fold increases in anti-CbpA and -PspA IgA ASCs after CCS stimulation. The results suggest that CbpA, PsaA, and PspA may be good upper respiratory mucosal antigens in children. Adenoids may be important inductive sites for memory IgG responses and important sources of salivary IgA. Some protein antigens may also prime for mucosal IgA memory. These data support the effort to explore mucosal immunization against pneumococcal infection...|$|R

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of AB S tam ponade in the control of intra-operative bleeding occurring during ad enoidectomy performed in {{children under the age of}} 12. Sixty children were randomized to receive 1 to 5 minute-tamponade with either ABS or topical gauze sponges soaked in saline solution (SS) during their ad enoidectomy [...] Time-to-haemostasis and the number of packs required were recorded. A visual analog scale was used by the operating surgeon to record subjective data, including the rate of bleeding following the first adenoid pack removal (0 = none, 3 =brisk). Compared to the children in the SS group (n= 30), time-to-haemostasis seen in ABS patients (n= 30) was significantly shorter (mean ± standard deviation, 1. 93 ± 1. 39 min vs 3. 20 ± 1. 50 min; p< 0. 0001); they required a lower number of packs (mean, 1. 93 vs. 3. 20), and appeared to bleed less (53. 3 % vs 6. 7 %; p= 0. 0001).

40|$|Introducción: Insuficiencia velofaríngea (IVF) es una posible complicación asociada a cirugía adenoamigdalina, cuya incidencia real es difícil de establecer, según la {{literatura}}, su frecuencia estimada es de 1 en 1. 500 - 10. 000 adenoidectomías. Sin embargo, no hay registro en la literatura de IVF transitoria posoperatoria. Nuestra hipótesis del trabajo: la IVF posoperatoria, tanto transitoria como definitiva, está subdiagnosticada o subregistrada. Objetivo: Evaluar la frecuencia y estudiar los factores predisponentes de IVF transitoria y definitiva posoperatoria en una población del Área Occidente de la Región Metropolitana de Chile, 2004 - 2007. Material y método: Estudio descriptivo y retrospectivo, Revisión de fichas clínicas y registros de la Unidad de Fonoaudiología de pacientes Introduction: Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is {{a possible}} complication associated with adenotonsillar surgery, whose real incidence is difficult to establish, according to the literature, the estimated frequency is 1 in 1500 - 10000 <b>adenoidectomies.</b> However, {{there is no record}} in the literature of transient postoperative VPI. Hypothesis: The postoperative VPI, both transient and permanent, is underdiagnosed and underreported. Aim: To evaluate the frequency and predisposing factors study transient and permanent postoperative VPI in a population of the West Area of the Metropolitan Region of Chile, 2004 - 2007. Material and method: A retrospective study, clinical records and records from the Audiology Unit of patients < 15 years, operated as adenotonsillar pathology in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hospital San Juan de Dios, from 2004 to 2007. Results: There were 18 cases of transient postoperative VPI which corresponds to 1. 2 % (n = 1458). The frequency of permanent postoperative VPI was zero. Conclusion: It was not possible to analyze the possible predisposing factors for postoperative VPI. The percentage of transient found VPI is a statistical reference for the development of informed consent. It is possible that the frequency found to be lower than actual due to inadequate recording and postoperative control. We believe that we need a study protocol and postoperative monitoring in all VPI patients undergoing adenotonsillar surgery...|$|R
40|$|At present, 56 {{types of}} human {{adenovirus}} (HAdVs) {{have been identified}} and {{found to be associated}} with a variety of clinical features in the respiratory tract, eye, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. In additions, HAdVs are able to establish persistent and latent infections in humans. Most of the work which has been carried out recently is related to adenovirus vectors and little has been done in other areas such as the nature and mechanisms of adenovirus persistence and latency in human tissues. Another area needing more investigation is the stability of the adenovirus genome which is useful for the development of adenovirus vectors and vaccines and for better understanding of adenovirus evolution especially with conflicting views about this issue. Recombination between two types of adenovirus can happen when the hexon epitope from one type and the fibre epitope from another type are found (intermediate strains). These recombinants can be detected by the conflicting results for serum neutralization (SN) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests or by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hexon and fibre regions of the adenovirus genome. The first part of this study is related to the stability and evolution of different adenovirus species. A total of 31 clinical isolates from AIDS patients previously typed in the hexon L 2 region and the fibre knob region were analysed. These isolates were found to be from species D adenovirus (HAdV-D) and 28 of them had contradictory typing results in these two regions so they are clearly intermediate strains. Two isolates appear to be completely new and one isolate (Aids 32) was typed as HAdV-D 23 variant in both hexon L 2 and fibre knob regions. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hexon L 1, fibre shaft and penton regions of these adenoviruses revealed that no intragene recombination events occurred between the hexon L 1 and L 2 regions or between the fibre knob and fibre shaft regions. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the penton showed that some of the intermediate strains had sequences from a third type of adenovirus in these regions. The penton analysis showed also that intragene recombination between penton HVR and RGD loop regions was common. New types of adenovirus were detected and sequential infection with different adenovirus variants was observed in some patients which indicates that the genome of HAdV-D from AIDS patients are not stable. Full genome sequencing and analysis was carried out for three isolates, two of them appeared to be new types of HAdV-D and the result of multi-recombination events and the third isolate appeared to be a variant of HAdV-D 23. The stability of species B adenovirus (HAdV-B) was also analysed. A total of 96 isolates collected from the Manchester area typed previously by serum neutralization (SN) were analysed in five genome regions. Most of these isolates were HAdV-B 3 and HAdV-B 7 collected during a 15 months outbreak. The rest of the isolates were HAdV-B types 3 and 7 collected in different years following the outbreak in addition to other adenovirus types isolated from different years. The phylogenetic analysis results of all the isolates in the structural regions: hexon L 2, penton and fibre knob were found to be consistent and no mismatches (hexon from one type and fiber from another type) were observed. Most of the isolates in the DNA polymerase and E 1 A regions had the same clustering patterns as the structural regions. However, one HAdV-B 7 and one HAdV-B 11 isolate changed their clustering patterns in the DNA polymerase region. In addition, HAdV-B 16 isolates changed their clustering patterns in both DNA polymerase and E 1 A regions. The changes of the clustering patterns of some isolates is more likely related to natural variations rather than recombination which indicate that species B adenovirus genome is stable in general. The last part of this study is investigating adenovirus persistence and latency in human tissues. Tonsils and adenoids (106 right and left tonsils and 10 adenoids) were obtained from 57 patients who underwent routine tonsillectomies and/or <b>adenoidectomies.</b> Eighty four (72. 41 %) tonsils and adenoids samples were positive for HAdV by real-time PCR. The viral load was not the same in the right and left tonsils in most of the cases and ranged from 280 to more than 2. 6 x 106 copies/ 107 cells. Seventy eight of 84 positive samples could be typed by sequencing of the hexon L 1 region. Species C types were detected in 82 % of the samples followed by species B (7. 7 %), HAdV-E 4 (7. 7 %) and HAdV-F 41 (2. 56 %). No DNA methylation was detected in the major late promoter (MLP) and E 1 A promoter regions of six tonsils and adenoids samples and two clinical isolates.

50|$|The {{relationship}} between enuresis and obstructive apnea, and {{the benefit of}} <b>adenoidectomy</b> by implication, is complex and controversial.
