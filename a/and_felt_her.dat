5|$|Wilton {{returned}} for the series' 2005 Christmas special as Davies wanted {{to include a}} familiar character whose presence would ease the transition following {{a change in the}} series' lead actor. Despite her character having been introduced as fair minded and hard working, Harriet is depicted as an uncompromising Prime Minister, which led to comparisons to real life politicians. Response to the character's political decisions prompted mixed commentary from the media; some reviewers felt that the character had acted unreasonably whilst others sympathised with her actions <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> scripted political demise was unjust.|$|E
500|$|Chesimard {{changed her}} name to Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971. Assata is a West African name, derived from the Arabic name Aisha, said to mean [...] "she who struggles", while Shakur means [...] "thankful one" [...] in Arabic. Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really {{had nothing to do}} with me. I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman”.|$|E
500|$|The {{aftermath}} dominated EastEnders in 2005 {{and helped}} to revive {{the fortunes of the}} show. According to the former head of BBC Drama Serials, Mal Young, this was dependent on the character of Chrissie, who was responsible for [...] "anchoring the success of the anniversary storyline". A similar sentiment was expressed by Ian Hyland in the Sunday Mirror, who although critical of the convuluted plot felt EastEnders was improving [...] "mainly because Chrissie is doing her best to rescue the fallout from the storyline dirty bomb Den's murder has become", and described the character as performing a [...] "rescue act" [...] on the show. However, Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror was highly critical of Chrissie, calling her [...] "the ludicrous Lady MacBeth wannabe", <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> departure was ennabling EastEnders to move forward. In contrast, the TV editor of the Telegraph hailed Chrissie as [...] "helping revive the show's fortunes that had been lagging somewhat in recent years".|$|E

60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} his innuendo, <b>and</b> Saxon <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> cheeks flaming.|$|R
60|$|Terrified by that threat, Valerie had blenched, <b>and</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> spirit deserting her.|$|R
500|$|Hepburn {{returned}} to Stratford {{in the summer}} of 1960 to play Viola in Twelfth Night and Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra. The New York Post wrote of her Cleopatra, [...] "Hepburn offers a highly versatile performance ... once or twice going in for her famous mannerisms and always being fascinating to watch." [...] Hepburn herself was proud of the role. Her repertoire was further improved when she appeared in Sidney Lumet's film version of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962). It was a low-budget production, and she appeared in the film for a tenth of her established salary. She called it [...] "the greatest [...] this country has ever produced" [...] and the role of morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone [...] "the most challenging female role in American drama", <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> performance was the best screen work of her career. Long Day's Journey Into Night earned Hepburn an Oscar nomination and the Best Actress Award at the Cannes Film Festival. It remains one of her most praised performances.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} many positive reviews. John Preston, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called the episode an [...] "undiluted triumph". Opening his review, he said [...] "last night's episode {{struck me as}} being as close to 50minutes of pure pleasure as you're likely to get on television". He noted the episode's clever tackling of the topical theme of obesity, and its mixture of emotion and special effects. In closing, he said [...] "the dejected critic, denied even the smallest nit to pick, walks glumly away". Scott Matthewman of The Stage lamented that the Adipose were not threatening enough. He liked the Adipose's execution of Miss Foster, a [...] "momentary pause in mid-air, gravity only kicking in when the character looks down", comparing it to Wile E. Coyote and Chuck Jones, which [...] " [...] a nice little touch in an episode... full of them". He also appreciated Tate, saying that [...] "David Tennant finally has a partner who is approaching an equal". [...] Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote that Tate was [...] "not right for this role" [...] and [...] "too hysterical, too comedy, not cool enough", <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> inclusion {{was an attempt to}} trade on the popularity of her own series and [...] "broaden the appeal of [...] still further". He also found the music [...] "a bit oppressive" [...] but concluded that, despite these criticisms, the show was [...] "still awfully nice television". Keith Watson of Metro gave the episode 4 stars out of 5. He admitted that despite his dislike of Tate, [...] "she isn't that bad". His review of the Adipose was positive, citing them as a reason {{of the quality of the}} show. Closing, he said [...] "it split [...] sides".|$|E
2500|$|As a young girl, Friedan {{was active}} in both Marxist and Jewish circles; she later wrote how she felt {{isolated}} from the latter community at times, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> [...] "passion against injustice...originated from my feelings of the injustice of anti-Semitism". She attended Peoria High School, and {{became involved in the}} school newspaper. When her application to write a column was turned down, she and six other friends launched a literary magazine called Tide, which discussed home life rather than school life.|$|E

60|$|The word criminals sounded harsh to {{the ear of}} Eve, <b>and</b> she <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> cheek {{becoming}} pale.|$|R
2500|$|Casting the two lead actresses for {{the film}} proved {{difficult}} for Pawlikowski, and the overall casting procedure took about eight months. Pawlikowski searched in schools, universities, theatre groups and public castings. He discovered Natalie Press first, and sought her counterpart by holding workshops together with Press and Considine. [...] During this process, he finally Emily Blunt, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> to be the ideal Tamsin. The chemistry between Press and Blunt was perfect, and they first did a tryout with the [...] "Pavlova-dancing scene", which worked out perfectly. Emily Blunt is a competent cellist, and is listed in the credits as the performer of [...] "The Swan" [...] by Camille Saint-Saëns. Pawlikowski already knew Paddy Considine from their earlier collaboration Last Resort and cast him as Phil.|$|E

6000|$|... "As ye sow--so shall ye reap!" [...] was Dorn's reply, {{strong and}} thrilling. <b>And</b> Lenore <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> father's strange, heart-satisfying content.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped on}} {{to land and}} lifted her out. She {{hesitated for a moment}} <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her</b> purse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But tell--tell me first," [...] she cried, frantically. She {{could not}} bear suspense, <b>and</b> she <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> senses {{slipping}} away from her.|$|R
60|$|But Saxon {{noted the}} {{heightened}} {{color in the}} other's cheek, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> quicker breathing.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard her}} turn quickly, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> eyes upon him. He went on doggedly.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{looked at}} him <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> nerves begin to tingle. A soft, warm wave stole over her.|$|E
60|$|She gave a start <b>and</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> large {{eyes look}} at me, but I {{went on with}} it and with my needlework.|$|R

60|$|Anne Mie, in {{a remote}} corner of the hall, had heard the name, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> very soul sicken at its sound.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe clung {{about her}} neck, kissed and fondled her, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> cheeks wet with tears, in the passionate {{tenderness}} of the returning caress.|$|E
60|$|She waited, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> husband's arm {{pass around}} her {{shoulder}} and under her own arm, and yielded to his drawing down of her to him.|$|E

60|$|All at once {{he showed}} the ravages of pain and loss that the last year had added to his life of struggle. Lenore embraced him <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> heart full.|$|E
6000|$|It was undignified! She bit her lip, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> false position, {{as with a}} quiver of {{the voice}} she replied, 'We shall make nothing but {{mischief}} if we talk now. Go on with your business.' ...|$|E
60|$|The poet espied, pursued and overtook the infant. He {{observed}} that apparently she drew her breath lightly <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>her</b> life in every limb, and that presumably her acquaintance with death {{was of the}} most superficial character.|$|E
60|$|She {{put down}} the sticks she held upon the fender, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>her</b> handkerchief. She began to sob and talk quickly.|$|R
