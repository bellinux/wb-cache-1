The shooter decides {{his or her own}} tempo as long as the maximum time is not exceeded, but in the final round for the top shooters, separate commands are given for each shot so that the audience may follow the progress of the standings.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only {{for people who do}} not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

25|$|Mr. O'Sullivan â€“ They cannot pay {{unreasonable}} rents, {{they wish}} to pay what is fair and just <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> accepted. If not let the landlords who refuse take the consequences of refusal on their own heads.|$|E

25|$|The {{taking of}} a {{thorough}} medical history while {{keeping in mind}} alternative diagnoses {{and the possibility of}} more than one ailment in the same patient is the first step.

25|$|Socrates's speech, on {{the other}} hand, starts with a thesis and {{proceeds}} to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods.

Old ampoules containing radium solutions must be opened with care because radiolytic decomposition of water can produce an overpressure of hydrogen and oxygen gas.|$|E
25|$|Sodium thiosulfate {{is used to}} dechlorinate tapwater for aquariums {{or treat}} {{effluent}} from wastewater treatments prior to release into rivers.

25|$|The {{constitution}} {{mandates that}} taxation must be general and equal in nature, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> proportionate to one's ability to pay. The Federal Supreme Court has interpreted this as prohibiting a regressive tax, although flat rate taxes (as instituted in several cantons) {{are held to}} be constitutional by tax law scholars. Moreover, double taxation by several cantons is constitutionally prohibited, as is a confiscatory rate of taxation.|$|E
25|$|A {{characteristic}} of electricity {{is that it}} is not a primary energy freely present in nature in remarkable amounts <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> produced. Production is carried out in power plants. Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromechanical generators, primarily driven by heat engines fueled by combustion or nuclear fission but also by other means such as the kinetic energy of flowing water and wind. Other energy sources include solar photovoltaics and geothermal power.|$|E
