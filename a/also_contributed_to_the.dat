5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, {{as well as their}} overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|During the war {{some women}} {{took on the}} added {{responsibility}} of running family farms and businesses. Hoosier women <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> war effort as nurses and volunteers in charitable organizations, most commonly the local Ladies' Aid Societies. In January 1863 Governor Morton and the Indiana Sanitary Commission began recruiting women to work as nurses in military hospitals and on ships.|$|E
5|$|Glacial meltwaters <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} {{and development of}} many of the caves in the limestone area. Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves.|$|E

5|$|The era of import {{substitution}} ended in 1976, {{but at the}} same time growing government spending, large wage increases and inefficient production created a chronic inflation that rose through the 1980s. The measures enacted during the last dictatorship <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> huge foreign debt by the late 1980s, which became equivalent to three-fourths of the GNP.|$|E
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|Augustin de Candolle was {{the first}} of four generations of botanists in the de Candolle dynasty. His son, Alphonse de Candolle, whom he fathered with his wife, Mademoiselle Torras, {{eventually}} succeeded to his father's chair in botany and continued the Prodromus. Casimir Pyrame de Candolle, Augustin de Candolle's grandson, <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Prodromus through his detailed, extensive research and characterization of the Piperaceae family of plants. Augustin de Candolle's great-grandson, Richard Émile Augustin de Candolle, was also a botanist. Augustin de Candolle died on 9 September 1841 in Geneva, after being sick for many years.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; but they also occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{helped develop}} the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, which became a {{cornerstone}} of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized {{by a number of}} Paris Academy Prizes {{over the course of his}} career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the sun. His calculations <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of accurate longitude tables.|$|E

5|$|Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, {{enabling}} his rival, CharlesIII of Naples, {{to stabilize}} his rule in Southern Italy {{during the next}} months. The consolidation of CharlesIII's position in Naples <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, but she refused him. He left Hungary in early 1385.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Evans was {{occasionally}} {{replaced by}} the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which <b>also</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> band's ill feeling toward Evans. By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation {{which led to a}} support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.|$|E

Art direction was done by Itaru Hinoue who also worked on the computer graphics along with aritsts Miracle Mikipon and Shinory.
