500|$|In 2012, Parker {{appeared}} as a World War II squadron commander in Red Tails, a film portraying Tuskegee Airmen. Parker's character drinks {{to cope with the}} stress of the fighter pilot lifestyle. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post praised then-unknown actors Parker and David Oyelowo. In the movie, Parker plays Marty [...] "Easy" [...] Julian who commanded the escorts for the World War II bombers in the face of Nazi fighter planes. While Peter Travers of Rolling Stone noted that Parker shined in his role, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt Oyelowo stood out. Although the story is a fictionalization, Bilge Ebiri of New York and Holden note that {{the relationship between the two}} is the story's central one. Holden compared Parker's presence to that of Denzel Washington. In Arbitrage, Parker's talents were underutilized as the son of a chauffeur who gets caught in a murder coverup, according to David Denby of The New Yorker. Nonetheless, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe notes that Parker's portrayal of the Harlem native is the only sympathetic character of the film. Travers notes the role provides Richard Gere's elitist character with his only interactions with a diverse character in the film. Parker's third and final film of 2012 was in Spike Lee's Red Hook Summer. Parker played <b>a</b> <b>gang</b> <b>member</b> named Box, whose role was not central to the film progression according to Phillips, although convincingly menacing according to Smith.|$|E
