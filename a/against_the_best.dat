5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Billed as Messi versus Germany, the world's {{best player}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team, the final was {{a repeat of}} the 1990 final {{featuring}} Diego Maradona. Within the first half-hour, Messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. He missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular {{at the start of the}} second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. Substitute Mario Götze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that Messi sent over the net, as Germany won the match 1–0 to claim the World Cup. At the conclusion of the final, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. In addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. However, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; FIFA President Sepp Blatter expressed his surprise, while Maradona suggested that Messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 Daytona 200, after early leader Gary Nixon retired, Roberts battled for {{the lead}} with former 500cc world champion, Giacomo Agostini before an {{overheated}} engine forced him to settle for second place. In April 1974, Roberts ventured to Europe {{for the first time}} to compete in the prestigious mola 200 road race for 750cc motorcycles. He made a positive impression competing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> road racers in the world, once again finishing second to Agostini. He then traveled to England with a team of American riders to compete against a British riding team in the 1974 Transatlantic Match races. The conventional wisdom at the time was that American riders, who competed mostly in dirt track races, could not race on asphalt at the same level as the British riders, who specialized in road racing events. Roberts dispelled any such notions by winning three of the six races and finishing second in the remaining three races. Roberts was the top individual points scorer in the event with 93 points, five more than Barry Sheene, the top British rider.|$|E

25|$|A skilful {{right-handed}} batsman, Hearne was exceptionally {{straight and}} a master at placing the ball into gaps. He was not an aggressive batsman, but his skill allowed him to score at quite an efficient rate <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowling. He bowled leg spin from a very short run-up, but had such speed of action that he was almost medium pace.|$|E

He carried on until he reached 144, before holing out to Gillespie off MacGill. Then the score read: 329/6. Patel and Agarkar carried on until no more play was possible due to bad light.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the factors}} that made Borg unique was his {{dominance}} on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where baseliners since World War II did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves (but he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves).|$|E

25|$|Chaminda Vaas took 8 wickets for 19 runs in 2001/02 <b>against</b> Zimbabwe, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowling {{performance}} in a One Day International match. The Zimbabwean total of 38 was the lowest team innings total in ODIs at that point of time.|$|R
25|$|He bowled {{at around}} medium pace and on English pitches {{of his time}} could gain spin, so that when rain {{affected}} the pitch he was unplayable. <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> batsmen, too, Lohmann possessed skill and guile, and he could vary his pace, flight and break deceptively, so as to worry batsmen on better pitches. He was the finest slip fielder of his time and in county cricket a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries for Surrey and averaged 25 in 1887.|$|E
25|$|Mihalić {{started working}} at age 16 as a {{printing}} house apprentice. With his first wages {{he bought a}} bicycle, joined the Olimp cycling club, and then spent {{the next four years}} racing for them. He was fairly successful, being able to score top ten finishes competing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Croatian cyclists of the era. However, his enthusiasm for the sport was dampened by a number of major crashes he suffered in training and racing which resulted in injuries and permanent scarring.|$|E
25|$|Following the openers is the No. 3 or one-drop batsman. His {{job is to}} {{take over}} from the openers and {{typically}} play a careful and prolonged innings, effectively tying up {{one end of the}} batting. This brings in some stability in the batting, as new batsmen find it difficult to settle down and it helps to have a settled batsman at the other end. The best batsman of the team is usually put at number 3 or 4, to protect him from the difficulties of batting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bowlers on a fresh pitch and to allow him to play a long innings.|$|E

25|$|U.S. Navy and Marine F6F pilots flew 66,530 combat sorties {{and claimed}} 5,163 kills (56% of all U.S. Navy/Marine air {{victories}} of the war) at a recorded cost of 270 Hellcats in aerial combat (an overall kill-to-loss ratio of 19:1 based on claimed but not confirmed kills). Claimed victories were often highly exaggerated during the war. Even so, the aircraft performed well <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Japanese opponents with a claimed 13:1 kill ratio against the A6M Zero, 9.5:1 against the Nakajima Ki-84, and 3.7:1 against the Mitsubishi J2M {{during the last}} year of the war. The F6F became the prime ace-maker aircraft in the American inventory, with 305 Hellcat aces. The U.S. successes were not only attributed to superior aircraft, but also from 1942 onwards, they faced increasingly inexperienced Japanese aviators as well as having the advantage of increasing numerical superiority. In the ground attack role, Hellcats dropped 6,503tons (5,899tonnes) of bombs.|$|E
25|$|Illingworth played 787 {{first-class}} matches over nearly 33 years. As a bowler {{in county}} cricket, he took 2072 wickets. He sent down 408 balls without reward {{in the three}} Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an over in his Test career. He was not a sharp spinner of the ball, relying on accuracy and subtle variations of flight, but his arm ball was particularly effective with many of his victims being caught at slip, playing for spin that was not there. His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in all, with a best of 162, {{at an average of}} 28.06. Against the Rest of the World in 1970, Illingworth topped the England averages with 476 runs (52.89) and six half-centuries, a testament to his grit and determination <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> in the world.|$|E

On 16 December 2014, team roster was strengthened with addition of Kšyštof Lavrinovič, who has signed two-year deal with Rytas. Later, on 5 January 2014, another Lithuania national team member Simas Jasaitis also signed with Rytas {{for the third time in}} his career. Lietuvos rytas started the Last-32 stage in EuroCup by winning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> team in Poland, Turów Zgorzelec which was relegated to Eurocup after winning only one game in Euroleague's regular season. Despite successful start, Rytas lost three games of six in the second stage and qualified into the next round by taking 2nd place in the group only after the crucial smash-up of Telenet Oostende 111–83 at the last game in Vilnius. Due to questionable shape of the team, Virginijus Šeškus was fired as head coach. Despite fired as head coach, Šeškus stayed in Rytas as an assistant of the new head coach Marcelo Nicola.|$|E
