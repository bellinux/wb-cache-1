25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on <b>a</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope,</b> which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into <b>a</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was just one of the many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{increasing}} the number of teams would increase the validity of team comparisons in conferences, which do not compete with one another during the regular season; teams typically only play three or four non-conference games, as the result of pre-determined schedules. BCS proponents view the possibility of expanded competitive post-season opportunities as negative. The primary delivery of this objection is <b>a</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> argument rhetorically known as bracket creep. Implementation of a playoff system, proponents object, would lead to other, more serious consequences, such as the diminished value of the regular season, diminished value of the bowl tradition, or damage to the collegiate academic calendar year. Critics, including Republican congressman Joe Barton, have been quick to respond to these red herrings, noting that teams from non-AQ conferences are already excluded from the national championship and their inclusion would only improve the meaningfulness of the regular season.|$|E

After Prohibition took effect in 1920 until its demise in 1933, it opened up a financial bonanza for criminal activity, especially underground bootlegging and the smuggling of liquor into Chicago, Gary, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Evansville and other thirsty cities. Enforcement was haphazard; the Anti-Saloon League {{was more of a}} lobbying agency and never rallied community support for enforcement. The KKK called for punishment of bootleggers and set up the [...] "Horse Thief Detective Association" [...] (HTDA) to make extra-legal raids on speakeasies and gambling joints. It seldom cooperated with law enforcement or the state or federal courts. Instead gave enforcement a bad name. Arthur Gillom, a Republican elected state attorney general over Klan opposition in 1924, did not tolerate its extra-legal operations. Instead, [...] "He stressed the dangers of citizens relinquishing their constitutional rights and personal freedoms, and emphasized the importance of representative government (at all levels), states' rights, and the concept of separation of church and state."

500|$|The {{first section}} {{of the book is}} a {{discussion}} of targeted killing of non-combatants. In an essay titled [...] "Rebutting the Civilian Presumption: Playing Whack-a-Mole Without a Mallet?", Colonel Mark Maxwell criticizes the opposition of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to targeted killing. Maxwell writes that individuals may indeed serve a combat task without being a member of a particular state force. He argues for an extension of the definition of combatant to include those who arm themselves and engage in combat roles. [...] "Targeting Co-Belligerents" [...] by professor Jens David Ohlin supports Maxwell's opinion and describes an analytical viewpoint called [...] "linkage" [...] in which he states armed terrorists and members of organizations can be killed. Ohlin interprets the guidelines of the ICRC to include reliance upon a military system of identification of combatants. [...] "Can Just War Theory Justify Targeted Killing" [...] by professor Daniel Statman is an analysis of three thought processes used to discuss targeted killing rules: [...] "contractualist", [...] "collectivist", and [...] "individualist". Statman writes that the tactic of targeted killing is a just form of combat in each of these analyses. New York University and Oxford University professor Jeremy Waldron deconstructs the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. He says that similar rationalizations could be used by the enemy against those conducting the targeted killings, there may be an inherent selection bias of targets, and warns of <b>a</b> <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> when defending an actor that uses the methodology.|$|E

[...] Afterwards, Bevin was asked about the [...] "blood ... shed" [...] part of the speech and, according to a summary, [...] "appeared to say {{he was referring to the}} cost paid by men and women in uniform." [...] A third account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter.

40|$|Intimate partner abuse (or {{relationship}} abuse) {{against women}} is recognised {{as a major}} public health issue. A number of relationship abuse prevention programs targeted at youth have been developed in Australia. These programs are generally aimed at changing attitudes, and take the stance that girls should {{not be viewed as}} being responsible for protecting themselves against violence. In this paper it is argued that the current, dominant focus on physical violence, over other forms of relationship abuse, limits the potential effectiveness of programs that might otherwise help young people to resist the development of abusive dynamics. It is also argued that programs that presume a victim status for girls and a perpetrator status for boys are both inconsistent with contemporary evidence and unlikely to empower young people at risk of chronic perpetration and/or victimisation to avoid such outcomes. <b>A</b> dyadic <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> model of chronic relationship abuse is proposed and new directions for prevention research in this area are suggested...|$|R

On the contrary, GM technology could become an essential tool to achieve sustainable intensive agriculture. Nevertheless, public opinion, thanks to long campaigns by lobby groups with no scientific basis to their arguments, has imposed a very complex regulatory framework.
