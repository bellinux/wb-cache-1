5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War: Ascension {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original God of War (2005); Chains of Olympus (2008) takes place some time between Ascension and God of War. The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) <b>and</b> <b>past</b> (<b>the</b> preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of the Damned and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are explored in the game.|$|E

Further north, I-75 passes to the southeast of Monroe and crosses the River Raisin between {{the city and the}} river mouth. North of the river, the freeway turns further inland running through farmland. Near Newport, I-275 splits off to the northwest and I-75 continues its northeasterly trek through Monroe County. When it crosses the Huron River, the trunkline enters Wayne County between South Rockwood and Rockwood.|$|E

5|$|The highway turns westward along Wirtz Road <b>and</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} terminus {{of county}} road F-97 {{in the northern}} part of Gladwin County. Near a crossing with the Cedar River, M-18 turns north along Bard Road and then west again along Renas Road. The highway returns to its northerly course when it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, cutting across the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County. Through the southern portion of the county, the road runs through the Roscommon forest management unit of the Au Sable State Forest as it approaches Prudenville. In that community, M-18 turns northeasterly and runs along M-55 along the eastern shore of Houghton Lake. The two highways separate on the eastern edge of town, and M-18 turns northward, intersecting the northern end of M-157. M-18 continues north, parallel to Interstate 75 (I-75) near Higgins Lake; M-18 crosses I-75 at exit239 south of Roscommon.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went in off the post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, cutting in from the right and drilling a low shot across the face of goal <b>and</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E

Taking on the name Scottsville–Mumford Road, NY383 follows Oatka Creek east through open fields and passes through the small hamlet of Garbutt {{on its way to the}} village of Scottsville, where it becomes Caledonia Avenue. At an intersection with the southern terminus of NY386, NY383 turns east onto Main Street and follows it through the residential southern portion of the village <b>and</b> <b>past</b> <b>the</b> Scottsville Free Library. Main Street comes to an end at a junction with River Road (NY251, which has its western terminus here) and Rochester Street near the northern bank of Oatka Creek. Here, NY383 curves north onto Rochester Street and proceeds through eastern Scottsville. The street name of NY383 becomes Scottsville Road upon intersecting the western terminus of NY253. Past this junction, the surroundings shift from village streets to housing tracts as the route exits Scottsville. North of the village, NY383 re-enters open fields once again upon crossing the Wheatland–Chili town line.|$|E
