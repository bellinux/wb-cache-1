5|$|Located to {{the left}} of the main altar is the side <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the Sacred Heart. It was {{previously}} used as the high <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the original cathedral at Wellington Street. It now houses the Blessed Sacrament—serving as the cathedral's main tabernacle after the removal of the high altar in 1969—and is reserved for Eucharistic adoration.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Archbishop of Westminster, Herbert Vaughan, {{received}} some relics from the basilica of Saint-Sernin. The relics, believed {{at the time}} to be those of St Edmund, were intended for the high <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> London's Westminster Cathedral, which was then under construction.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, two highly {{elaborate}} metalwork {{covers for}} the treasure bindings of the Epistle and Gospel Books {{for the high}} <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> a large church, probably Ulm Minster, were made around 1506 but are full of spiky Gothic architectural details, although the many figures in high relief {{are on the verge}} of Renaissance style.|$|E

5|$|Peckham died on 8 December 1292 at Mortlake and {{was buried}} in the north transept, or the Martyrdom, of Canterbury Cathedral. His heart, however, was buried with the Franciscans under the high <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> their London church. His tomb still survives. He founded a college at Wingham, Kent in 1286, {{probably}} a college of canons serving a church.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Forgiveness {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} central nave. It is the first aspect of the {{interior}} that is seen upon entering the cathedral. It was the work of Spanish architect Jerónimo Balbás, and represents the first use of the estípite column (an inverted triangle-shaped pilaster) in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|When a monarch is anointed, the Dean of Westminster pours holy anointing {{oil from}} an ampulla into a spoon.

5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Purbeck Marble; {{it is likely that the}} Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this did}} not apply to the Subura slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental {{topography}} of the centre and of the Campus Martius, with the Ara Pacis (<b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central gnomon was an obelisk taken from Egypt. The relief sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the Res Gestae. Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the praetorians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.|$|E

5|$|An {{octagonal}} baptistry {{connected to}} the near the <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Saint Mary Magdalene in the gospel transept was constructed in 1853. Inside the baptistry is an earlier image of San Juan Bautista, a baptismal font and an unusual retablo built in 1852 housing the Santo Entierro in a glass coffin and the Nuestra Señora de los Dolores in the central niche.|$|E
5|$|In 387, Armenia was {{partitioned}} {{between the}} Roman Empire and the Sasanian Empire. The {{eastern part of}} Armenia where Etchmiadzin was located remained {{under the rule of}} Armenian vassal kings subject to Persia until 428, when the Armenian Kingdom was dissolved. In 450, in an attempt to impose Zoroastrianism on Armenians, Sasanian King Yazdegerd II built a fire temple inside the cathedral. The pyre of the fire temple was unearthed under the <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the east apse during the excavations in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th century {{religious}} hermits started inhabiting {{the caves}} on Mount Carmel, {{and in the}} 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites.

In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, the National Board of Antiquities {{claimed the}} relic {{as its own}} {{on the basis of}} the Finnish law on ancient objects, though it was contradicted by the Lutheran Cathedral Parish of Turku. However, the Board {{ultimately}} had the relic relocated to the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland, because Catholics still actively venerate the relic as sacred. Since then, it has been located inside the <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Luxury {{items were}} in high demand among the {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, {{and to a lesser}} degree among the wealthy town merchants. Brick and stone residential buildings became common, but only in cities. The mature Gothic style was represented not only in architecture, but also in sacral wooden sculpture.

5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E

5000|$|Many death metal {{fans and}} critics {{consider}} <b>Altars</b> <b>of</b> Madness {{to be one}} of the best death metal albums of all time. Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic wrote that one [...] "cannot deny its influence", and MetalSucks likewise wrote that it is [...] "impossible to ignore the importance of this release to the death metal genre." [...] UK magazine Terrorizer rates this album as both Morbid Angel's and death metal's finest hour, describing it as [...] "bludgeoning and raw but also technical, exacting and intimidatingly consistent". <b>Altars</b> <b>of</b> Madness has appeared at the top of lists of the greatest death metal albums of all time by Decibel magazine and Terrorizer magazine. [...] In April 2006, the album was inducted into the Decibel Hall of Fame. The magazine wrote that the album [...] "would turn death metal both upside down and inside out." [...] Robban Becirovic of Close-Up Magazine credits <b>Altars</b> <b>of</b> Madness with launching the popularity of death metal in Sweden:"...Morbid Angel's <b>Altars</b> <b>of</b> Madness changed everything the Swedish scene. Before that there was no clear distinction between death, speed, or thrash among regular metalheads. It was just brutal metal. But <b>Altars</b> <b>of</b> Madness opened people's eyes, and made us realize something new was going on. Everybody bought that record. Everybody. And thrash was executed by it - the whole genre just disappeared." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{continued}} to be rebellions and resistance to William's rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William's conquest of England.

5|$|This may again {{suggest the}} amphitheatre was flooded, as the {{monument}} referred to {{could be an}} <b>altar</b> <b>of</b> Diana, or Pluto, or of Jupiter Latiaris {{that may have been}} present in the centre of the arena, but Pliny the Elder mentions a bridge in connection with the lake of Augustus, suggesting there may have been an island there as well.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} the <b>Altar</b> <b>of</b> San Girolamo {{in the church}} of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{is the lack of}} historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar was carved after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E
