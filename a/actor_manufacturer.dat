40|$|ABSTRACT: Facility Management, {{as well as}} {{maintenance}} operations, {{suffers from}} the block in the operational level that avoid the leap to a strategic and integrated dimension expected to reduce risks and economic losses occurring after changing situations. Building Information Modelling {{seems to be an}} efficient system to introduce strategic FM, involve governments and their regulations inside public procurements and private construction processes. Is it possible the integration of Facility Management in BIM in Italy, Spain and Germany? If yes, how to ensure high levels of communication between AEC <b>actors,</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> users and Authorities? The answers converge into the development of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) Standard by buildingSMART International in compliance with European and national regulations in the three countries involved in this research.

40|$|Packaging {{affects the}} {{logistical}} and environmental efficiency of supply chains. The {{purpose is to}} increase knowledge of the current state, trade-offs and improvement potential of packaging logistics in supply chain practice. The research is based on 22 cases, each of which consists of supply chain mapping and structured interviews with three supply chain <b>actors</b> (<b>manufacturer,</b> distributor and retailer). The paper identifies and explains improvement areas, trade-offs and gaps in packaging systems from a supply chain perspective for the whole packaging system, each packaging level and each actor. The results highlight a supply chain potential of better incorporating the packaging system requirements from actors not responsible for developing or selecting packaging. The paper discusses models for cost and benefit sharing and for identification and decision-making about trade-offs in packaging systems. Companies should collaborate, apply an integrated approach and find new approaches to integrate customers and suppliers into the packaging development process...|$|R

Based on an extensive research on more than 20 studies, this study explores {{the risks associated with}} off-shore wind energy in Persian Gulf in Iran. This paper tries to identify the risks in related off-shore wind energy project, in order to specify which variables have the most impact on project by qualitative analysis through application of the impact and the possibility of every risk. A survey was conducted {{in order to determine the}} relative importance of variables and risks. Certain key components in completion of the project should be taken into account such as technology, research team, expert teams (personnel that have a good knowledge of this industry), and choosing the right spot where the wind farms will be located. The objective of this paper is to present the variables encountered in wind power project and to highlight the risks that must be controlled by the project developers, project team, supply chain <b>actors,</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> and all the stockholders involved in successful completion of a project...|$|R

The manufacturer has to process a set of jobs at the upstream stage and the downstream stage. The 3 PL {{is in charge of}} transportation of semi-?nished products from the upstream stage to the downstream stage. The manufacturer’s objective is to minimize makespan Cmax and the 3 PL’s objective is to minimize transportation cost TC. We investigate three different types of contract: the manufacturer dominates, the 3 PL adjusts; the manufacturer dominates, the 3 PL negotiates; the manufacturer and the 3 PL have the same bargaining power and cooperate. We provide exact polynomial-time algorithms or prove the NP-completeness of the scheduling problems in these three types of contract.

Owing to the prominence of the satellite-related activities, some sources use the term satellite industry interchangeably with the term space industry. The term space business has also been used. A narrow definition encompasses only hardware providers (primarily related to launch vehicles and satellites). This definition does not exclude certain activities, such as space tourism. Thus more broadly, space industry {{can be described as}} the companies involved in the space economy, and providing goods and services related to space. Space economy has been defined as [...] "all public and private actors involved in developing and providing space-enabled products and services.

To shed light on this we study ceramic tableware manufacturers {{in the city of}} Lampang, Thailand. Data consist of face-to-face interviews with principals in thirty-four manufacturers, and with representatives of supporting institutions.

40|$|Purpose - This paper proposes and empirically investigates two {{strategies}} that companies can employ to involve indirect suppliers in new product development (NPD) : supply network delegation; and supply network intervention. The {{implications of the}} two strategies are explored. Design/methodology/approach - The paper brings together the traditional NPD literature, organizational behaviour and organizational economics literature, and reports on three in-depth case studies of NPD projects, involving 39 semi-structured interviews across three supply networks. Findings - The findings reveal different manifestations of the two strategies of supply network intervention and delegation, when applied as part of supplier involvement in product development, and positive and negative indications of delegation and intervention, depending on the <b>actor</b> perspective: <b>manufacturers</b> perceive a need to control the product development process across several supply network tiers through intervention in supplier selection and communication, but these actions are likely to "tie {{the hands of the}} suppliers". Practical implications - Managers are advised to explicitly delegate decisions to suppliers, for example, by issuing parts approval lists and encouraging communication and problem solving amongst suppliers, and to exercise caution in applying the intervention strategy. Originality/value - The paper contributes {{to a better understanding of}} how to involve indirect (sub-) suppliers in product development, and the implications of these actions for multiple supply network actors...|$|R

40|$|Cyber-{{physical}} systems (CPS) are service {{systems that}} connect physical and cyber elements through global networks. CPS put upon sensors and actuators {{as well as}} omnipresent status data of smart products {{in order to facilitate}} the design of innovative service offerings. CPS typically require the co-operation of several <b>actors</b> such as <b>manufacturers</b> of smart products and service providers. Organiza-tional mining uses event log data produced by information systems to explore organizational struc-tures and to analyze social networks representing communication structures. Hence, organizational mining is a promising approach for changing the organization of several actors in a CPS for the bet-ter and for improving the delivery of innovative CPS service offerings.

40|$|International audienceData in {{smart cities}} is {{commonly}} {{generated by a}} large variety of participants including institutional <b>actors,</b> equipment <b>manufacturers,</b> network operators, infrastructure providers, service providers, and end users. This data potentially undergoes several transformations such as aggregation and/or composition before finally being consumed. In this context of sharing data between diverse consumers, {{it is essential to}} provide the data producers the means by which they can exercise control over how and by whom the data is used. To date, usage control has received attention in the domains of the web and social networks, in terms of confidentiality, privacy and access control aspects. However, it has not yet been fully applied in a rigorous manner in the context of smart cites. In this paper we study usage control with the goal {{to address the problem of}} providing stakeholders more control over their data and enforcing accountable management of such data. We first propose a new data usage policy, called DUPO, which captures the diversity of obligations and constraints resulting from the usage control requirements for smart cities. Next, we apply a defeasible logic based approach on DUPO to formally define rule language, solve rule conflicts, and elaborate reasoning. We then introduce the data handling mechanism, which provides useful functionality to process consumer's request, ensuring the accountability of the policy enforcement, and traceability of the data usage. To this end we benefit from SPINdle reasoner to implement the proposed usage control module covered main functionalities of the mechanis...|$|R
40|$|Mobile service {{innovation}} {{requires a}} broad set {{of resources and}} capabilities that are not controlled by one single <b>actor.</b> Equipment <b>manufacturers,</b> operators, content providers and application developers {{have to work together}} in so-called value networks in order to develop and offer services to end-users. There is serious debate as to how the collective actions of these interdependent but legally separate actors can be governed. In the past, operators controlled most activities in so-called walled gardens, but these are now being replaced by more open models of collaboration. These developments may be driven by technological, market-related and regulatory forces in the environment, but transitions between the phases of service innovation may also play a role. A co-evolutionary perspective that explains governance dynamics by combining these multi-level factors is lacking, as existing literature mostly takes a static perspective. This study provides insight into how and why the mechanisms used to govern mobile service innovation in value networks change over time. Building on theories on value networks, governance, service innovation and co-evolution, propositions are developed on the use of authority-based, contracts-based and trust-based governance. The propositions are refined and tested in qualitative case studies in the commercial and police domain, followed by a quantitative survey among practitioners and experts. Besides theoretical and domain-related implications, the findings provide a basis for a research program on governing ICT-enabled service innovation in value networks.

One year later his brother {{spent a year in}} his bureau before he opened his own. Ruf began to build houses for doctors, <b>actors</b> and <b>manufacturers</b> and they loved his light and bright buildings. In 1933, when he was 23 years old, he built a flat-roof house for Karl Schwend in Munich and was cautioned from the new authorities, because from 1933 on the building of a flat-roof house was forbidden. He continued building houses and now he had to build them with pitched roofs, but the interior did not change and was still bright and had wide rooms and large windows. From 1936-1938 he was ordered to build parts of the Werdenfels and the Kemmel barracks in Murnau, after the war they were used by the US army and German troops. As soon as possible {{he went back to the}} building of private houses. In 1939 Ruf had to go to war. From 1940 to 1942 he was allowed to stay at home because he worked as an independent architect with the family of Hugo Junkers. From 1934 to 1936, one year before his death, Junkers had allowed the 26-year-old architect to build an estate for his workers in Grünwald, Bavaria. Hugo Junkers, who had lost nearly all of his inventions and his factory in Dessau to the new authorities and now lived near Munich under surveillance, now did research for metal-housing. In 1942 Ruf had to go to the Russian front and after the war had ended, he went back to Germany by foot and directly began his work of rebuilding Germany with the Church Christkönig in Munich.|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{producing}} {{solar shading}} provides possibilities for a combined solution for solar shading and building integrated locally produced energy from renewable sources. The multi-functionality {{of these products}} calls for collaboration between a range of <b>actors</b> from <b>manufacturers,</b> clients, architects, engineers, and contractors. Two major challenges for the increased up-take of the technology has been identified and is dealt with in a transdisciplinary research project, called ELSA, involving industry and academic institutions. First, the successful architectural integration of solar shading in terms of form, size, colour, detailing etc. {{in relation to the}} overall building design will be decisive in order to persuade architects. Second, the development of these multi-functional products to reach functional, technical, economic and aesthetical qualities is dependent upon communication between different professions. As a means to initiate a dialogue between the different professional groups taking part in the ELSA project, a model, the AIQ-model (Architectural Integration Qualities), to assess preferences for architectural integration of energy producing solar shading was developed and tested in a workshop. The results indicate a large consensus across different professional groups when assessing successful architectural integrations. Consequently, discrepancies in aesthetic appraisal of energy producing solar shading should not be the main hindrance for a broader implementation of such solutions. The challenge rather lies in that architectural integration qualities will concur with other important aspects of the multi-functional solution, and not all professional groups will put architectural integration qualities above other functions. The workshop shows that the AIQ model serves its function to initiate and to focus discussions. The value of group discussions to reach consensus was also observed. The AIQ model provide definitions to clarify the judgment base behind aesthetic assessments that was appreciated but all groups but most easily applied by the architects. The model should be further developed to include also other aspects than aesthetics...|$|R

40|$|Changes in the environment, {{driven by}} {{globalization}} and technology development, give ground to instability and uncertainty within industries. Consequently, stable business models are challenged by disruption of previous industry boundaries and competition. While close innovation become progressively ambiguous, firms grow further dependent on external sources for innovation. Furthermore, translated to original equipment <b>manufacturers,</b> <b>actors</b> {{are subjected to}} developments in technology, customer behavior and tough market sentiments. In response to the changing dynamics, actors are found to invest in business model change {{to adapt to the}} new environment. In turn, the pressure is transferred onto suppliers, where Parker Hannifin SCS must engage in similar investments and align with prevailing changes, not to face the risk of business model obsolesce or incompatibility with its customers. Yet, as the business model is an interdependent system, an alteration in one dimension will require accordingly adjustment in the remainder parts. The aim of this thesis is to understand how a company within a mature industry proactively can engage to innovate the business model. To fulfill this purpose, the research is designed as a qualitative case study, with focus on how the focal company should organize to take on a proactive approach to innovate their business model. This thesis presents a process purposed to provide a structure for how a mature firm can approach proactive business model innovation. The process comprises 4 phases Assessment, Analysis, Alignment and Adaptability, including detailed sub-steps. The aim is to proactively explore external sources of innovation, rather than awaiting triggers, hence spur ideation that can enable break-outs from industry recipes. Analyzing the process application at Parker Hannifin SCS, it is found that a formal process with support and incentive to question habitual methods should be provided from the internal organization. Furthermore, a cross-functional team outside of hierarchal structure can ease the decision making and information flow, while creativity could benefit from a distinct mixture of participants in terms of team composition, with both well experienced and new employed with diverse backgrounds. Continually, the project team should be appointed so that competency within each business model dimension is covered, concerning the total system of value creation, proposition and capture. Still, it is essential that each member is open to challenge and adjust accustomed approaches. It is essential that SCS secure financial capacity to invest in the innovation process and to try various business models. As the process circulate around collaborative business development, it requires top management support for a culture and organizational mindset that is open to collaborations. Further, to comprehend the necessity of such mindset in order to improve probability of success with the possibility to achieve superior value creation through the value chain, thus increase market share and strengthen competitive positioning towards competing actors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{approaches}} {{the study of}} the (aerial) military and non-military drone through an examination of the communities that variously compel and propel it into action: that culturally constitute it. Employing the term ‘proponent communities’, this thesis {{approaches the}} drone through an empiric-led exploration of such <b>actors,</b> those including: <b>manufacturers,</b> industry, regulators, governments, militaries, trade associations and end users. These proponent communities are accessed through fieldwork at three central sites, namely military and non-military tradeshows, military conferences, and through the completion of numerous industry educational courses. Whilst by no means a homogenous group, such communities remain important in crafting, composing, (re) producing and circulating both technical and cultural knowledges of the drone. In approaching the drone’s cultural constitution, the thesis pursues two distinct analytic foci. First, in response to the tendency of extant scholarship to focus upon what the functioning drone does and its implications, thus treating it like a ‘black box’, the thesis ‘opens’ the drone through an exploration of particular proponent cultures through which it is instituted. Examining both the role of military drone operators and the employment of drones with multi-sensory payloads in emergency service settings, over two chapters the thesis explores the cultures through which the drone comes to function in framing that below it. Second, the thesis explores a series of mechanisms through which the drone is articulated, visualized and otherwise legitimated as a tool, asset, and commodity within military and non-military drone tradeshows. In approaching the drone at the tradeshow, the thesis expands extant analyses of the drone by considering its cultural constitution at such hitherto unexamined sites of consumption. In approaching the cultural constitution of the drone through these two strands of investigation the thesis offers three contributions. First, in working within a research context punctuated with access limitations, the thesis opens up different windows of access at which drone proponent communities gather, form, and (re) compose drone knowledges. Second, in approaching the drone at sites in which it is instituted and traded, the thesis engages with both proponent knowledges of employment, and articulations of expectation and potential therein. It demonstrates that such an engagement facilitates the challenging of several dominant and entrenched narratives surrounding the drone, variously revealing them as inadequate, fractured, or fantastical. Third, whilst the main contribution of this thesis is to geographies, and the wider interdisciplinary field, of drone scholarship, the thesis argues for, and demonstrates the value of, engaging with alternative geographical literatures in developing its argumentation. In situating the drone within such wider discussions and landscapes the thesis thus productively develops distinct frameworks through which to conceptually and empirically engage with the drone.
