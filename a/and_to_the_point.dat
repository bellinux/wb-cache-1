He blamed the generals, claiming they had attacked the Buddhists, not the special forces, and claimed Tung's men were now under the army's control and not used as a private army, which was false. Diệm also claimed that aid cutbacks had hindered the army and led to food shortages.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, Ellsworth's role {{in helping}} to {{establish}} the United States as a viable sovereign nation was important but could be easily overlooked. A {{good part of the}} reason for this was that he did not distinguish himself as an orator but worked as much as possible behind the scenes. He was said to have been dominant in his eloquence at the January 1788, Connecticut Ratifying Convention, but later as the de facto Senate majority leader he seems to have kept his arguments relatively short <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> His written prose could on occasion be tortuous, as best illustrated by the operative sentence in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the first of only two sentences). Over three hundred words long, this sentence is almost impossible to decipher as an explanation how state courts were answerable to federal authority. But perhaps this opacity was intentional, since the expansion of federal power specified by Section 25 was mostly overlooked in debate both in the Senate and House of Representatives despite having been the most important and potentially controversial portion of the Judiciary Act.|$|E

Only rarely do his photos include shadows falling on the background of the set. Horst rarely, if ever, used filters. While most of his work is in black & white, much of his color photography includes largely monochromatic settings to set off a colorful fashion. Horst's color photography did include documentation of society interior design, well noted in the volume Horst Interiors. He photographed a number of interiors designed by Robert Denning and Vincent Fourcade of Denning & Fourcade and often visited their homes on Manhattan and Long Island. After making the photograph, Horst generally left it up to others to develop, print, crop, and edit his work.|$|E

500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E
500|$|According to Argento expert Thomas Rostock, Tenebrae {{is filled}} with rhyming imagery that relates to the film's {{exploration}} of [...] "the dual nature of [...] two active murderers" [...] using doubles, inversions, reflections and [...] "re-reflections". Every major character {{has at least one}} double, and the theme extends to objects, locations, actions and events – major and minor. The doubling or mirroring of incidents and objects includes telephone booths, aircraft, homeless men, otherwise-meaningless public brawls in the background, car accidents, typewriters (literally side-by-side), keys, handkerchief, hands caught in doors and the characters themselves. Rostock cites several scenes where characters are set up in frame with their doppelgängers – one such is the first meeting of Peter Neal and Anne with Detectives Giermani and Altieri. McDonagh notes that Argento emphasizes the doubling between Neal and Giermani: [...] "Giermani... is made to reflect Neal even as Neal appropriates his role as investigator... the detective/writer and the writer/detective each belittles his other half, as though by being demeaned this inverted reflection could be made to go away." [...] McDonagh also observes that, in what is arguably the film's most potent shock, Neal at one point really does make Giermani [...] "go away", virtually replacing him on screen [...] "in a shot that is as schematically logical as it is logically outrageous." [...] Earlier, Neal killed a woman who – to his and the audience's surprise – was not Anne, but Altieri. Tenebrae itself is split almost exactly into two parts. The first half belongs to the murders of Berti; the second to those of Neal. The two are set up as mirrors of one another. Berti's killings with a razor are clinical, with [...] "lingering sexualized aggressiveness", whereas Neal's (with an axe) are crimes of passion committed for personal reasons or out of necessity; they are swift <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

500|$|Clarkson co-wrote {{the seventh}} track, [...] "Where Is Your Heart", with DioGuardi and Chantal Kreviazuk. She {{revealed}} {{that it was}} also about her boyfriend, Hodges, whom she described as [...] "wanting to get really into our relationship, and I just thought, 'Where are you in our relationship?'" [...] "Walk Away", the eight track, was also written by the three, with additional writing by Raine Maida. Clarkson described it as [...] "one of the brighter songs" [...] on Breakaway, and said that [...] "It's very blunt <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> 'I'm done with you, you're upsetting me.'" [...] DioGuardi and Shanks co-wrote the ninth track, [...] "You Found Me". Clarkson revealed, [...] "When I recorded this one, I was actually in a good place with a guy. It was very fitting {{at the time that}} I recorded it." [...] DioGuardi had also co-written the tenth track, [...] "I Hate Myself for Losing You", with Jimmy Harry and Shep Solomon. Clarkson described the song as [...] "depressing", but felt it {{could be used as a}} foreshadowing device. She explained [...] "I read something that Sting said in an interview, he talked about how the great thing about writing is that it is an emotional and therapeutic thing and you can get it out." [...] The eleventh track, [...] "Hear Me", was written by Clarkson, DioGuardi, and Clif Magness. Clarkson explained the song, [...] "It's is almost like a prayer to God. I haven't met the person whom I will spend the rest of my life with, but the song is a prayer to God about that. That's what the song is. 'God, I'm ready for 'the one!'" [...] The twelfth and closing track is a live recording of [...] "Beautiful Disaster", originally from Thankful. Clarkson admitted that she hated Thankfuls version of the song, and thought the production was distracting from the lyrics. So she decided to record a piano ballad version instead.|$|E

Writing for the Star Tribune, Lee Svitak Dean recommended the book as a holiday gift for cooks, commenting, [...] "It's all here, from guacamole and bacon canapés to New England apple and bacon griddlecakes and German fennel and bacon soup." [...] "No publishing season is complete without a bacon book," [...] wrote Kristen Browning-Blas of The Denver Post, who noted that Joanna Pruess's Seduced by Bacon was released the previous year. The New York Daily News noted that the book [...] "includes an introductory primer on the many wondrous bacon varieties along with easy-to-follow instruction for more than 150 international dishes, from guacamole with bacon to bacon-duck stew." [...] The Independent highlighted the book as number 11 on a list of [...] "The 50 Best Cookbooks", commenting, [...] "Bacon is a standard choice for many a simple supper, but there is nothing standard about Villas's book. The irresistible smell of bacon oozes from the pages, as Villas shows the versatility of bacon, even bacon desserts– for example, bacon and peanut butter chocolate truffles. Vegetarians beware; these dishes could prove too tempting." ...|$|E

[...] At the last named point, another stream falls into the Ligny on leaving a deep ravine, which commences northward of the village of Bothey, and thus secured the extreme-left of the Prussian position.
