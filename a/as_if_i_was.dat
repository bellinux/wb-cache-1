(Henry was a contract bridge expert and former husband of Kitty Munson Cooper.) He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March 1941. Writing to Sommerfeld in 1947, Bethe confided that [...] "I am much more at home in America than I ever was in Germany. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born in Germany only by mistake, and only came to my true homeland at 28." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> my mother and [...] was me. We were playing in our backyard again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... not everyone has to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E
500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> almost a ghost that came back alive.

By her own admission though, she was happy to oblige after talking to her seatmate. [...] She was however upset that [...] "The flight attendant treated me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> stupid”. El Al has insisted that there was no gender discrimination on El Al flights, that the flight attendant had made it clear to Ms. Rabinowitz that she was in no way obligated to move. [...] Much as with any seating issue on flights, including overweight or disabled passengers, the airline always tries to find amicable solutions.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} when Bukhari saw the earlier works and {{conveyed}} them, he found them, in their presentation, combining between what would be considered sahih (correct) and hasan (good) and {{that many of them}} included daʻīf (weak) hadith. This aroused his interest in compiling hadith whose authenticity was beyond doubt. What further strengthened his resolve was something his teacher, hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Hanthalee – better known as Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh – had told him. [...] "We were with Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh who said, ‘If only you would compile a book of only authentic narrations of the Prophet.’ This suggestion remained in my heart so I began compiling the Sahih." [...] Bukhari also said, [...] "I saw the Prophet in a dream and it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standing in front of him. In my hand was a fan with which I was protecting him. I asked some dream interpreters, who said to me, ‘You will protect him from lies.’ This is what compelled me to produce the Sahih." ...|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{learning}} {{it for the first}} time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] The problem with that was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the fastest gun. So, I don’t think I could have been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2015, Reinhart gained {{widespread}} recognition {{when her}} cover of [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] {{was used in}} an Extra Gum commercial. Entitled [...] "The Story of Sarah & Juan", the advertisement first began circulating on Facebook before a full version of the song was released separately through YouTube. The video gained momentum after being shared on Ellen DeGeneres's Facebook page, eventually becoming a viral phenomenon.

Additionally, the video was a candidate in the YouTube Ads of the Year contest for 2015, and it won for the category [...] "TheYoutubeAd That Gives You Feels." [...] Reinhart was credited with [...] "bringing the classic back to the Adult Contemporary Chart" [...] when the single debuted at number 25 on the Billboard AC chart dated January 16, 2016. With this debut, her cover became the seventh version of the song to chart on the AC since Elvis Presley's original release in 1962, and the first version to chart since UB40's reggae interpretation in 1993. The song reached a peak of number 16 on the AC chart dated April 21, 2016. Of the cover, Reinhart expressed: [...] "I {{wanted to make it}} sound <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking to or whispering to a loved one next to me, that kind of vibe." [...] For the song, Reinhart was recognized with a 2016 Women in Sync Award for [...] "Best Artist-Sync Tie-In." [...] The Women in Sync Awards is an annual event organized by SyncSummit which recognizes the [...] "excellence of the work done by women in the fields of music, visual media, interactive media, advertising and brands."
