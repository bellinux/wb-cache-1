5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, Native Americans inhabited {{the region where}} the Allegheny and the Monongahela join to form the Ohio. Paleo-Indians conducted a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the region perhaps as early as 19,000 years ago. Meadowcroft Rockshelter, an archaeological site west of Pittsburgh, provides evidence that these first Americans lived in the region from that date. During the Adena culture that followed, Mound Builders erected a large Indian Mound <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> site of McKees Rocks, about three miles (5km) {{from the head of}} the Ohio. The Indian Mound, a burial site, was augmented in later years by members of the Hopewell culture.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{awarded a}} $128million {{contract}} {{to the joint}} venture of Robinson Construction and Herzog Contracting (forming RCI-Herzog) in February 2004 for construction of the Rainier Valley segment of Central Link. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Rainier Valley segment was held by Sound Transit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> site of Othello station on June 8, 2004. Construction of the station began shortly thereafter and continued until late 2008. Light rail test trains began running through the Rainier Valley in August 2008, with service expected to start in July 2009.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision would jeopardize federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E

25|$|Hebard {{made her}} way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> capital city {{in the company of}} her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became part of the social scene with other young people at the newly {{constructed}} Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if things got out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne telephone pole.|$|E
30|$|Returns in <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>futures</b> {{market are}} <b>the</b> trading-price-value ratios (TPVR), {{which are the}} day’s closing prices (DCP) divided by the average money values (Barik and Supriya, 2007). The average money value (AMV) is the total trading value (TTV) divided by total trading quantity (TTQ), i.e., the total money value of business {{that took place in}} the market during the day divided by the total number of contracts for which business took place during the day. The total money value of business {{that took place in the}} market during the day reflects <b>the</b> money supply <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> market. <b>The</b> total number of contracts for which business took place during the day reflects <b>the</b> trading transactions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Nifty <b>Futures</b> market.

25|$|At the meeting, held in Naples, Florida from March 9–11, 2009, general {{managers}} of the teams discussed issues that concerned them.

The {{general managers}} could not agree on the planned rule change and took no further action. Kelly intends to review the issue <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> Competition committee meeting, which is held after the Stanley Cup final. The general managers also discussed the topic of fighting in hockey, and agreed to penalize further players who start fights directly after face-offs and to further enforce the existing 'instigator' rule. The managers agreed to award a second-round compensatory pick in the 2009 entry draft to the New York Rangers due to the death of Alexei Cherepanov.|$|E

It also suggested that the road be a municipal route, rather than a provincial one.
