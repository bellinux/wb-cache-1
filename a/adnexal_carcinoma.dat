40|$|Use of p 63 {{expression}} in distinguishing primary and metastatic cutaneous adnexal neoplasms from metastatic adenocarcinoma to skin Absract: p 63, a recently identified homologue of the p 53 gene, is mainly expressed by basal and myoepithelial cells in skin. Others {{and we have}} shown the value of p 63 in distinguishing primary adnexal tumors from visceral adenocarcinomas metastatic to skin. We now investigate the pattern of p 63 {{expression in}} metastases from skin <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and their cognate primaries and evaluate p 63 expression in a larger case series of malignant cutaneous adnexal neoplasms. Immunohistochemical analysis for p 63 was performed on 13 metastases of <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and their corresponding primary tumors. Twenty visceral metastatic adenocarcinomas to the skin and 7 primary mucinous carcinomas with cutaneous or visceral origin were compared. The majority (90. 9 %) of primary adnexal tumors strongly expressed p 63 and their metastases labeled similar to their cognate primary tumors. With one exception, primary or metastatic mucinous carcinomas did not express p 63. Metastases from two apocrine carcinomas lacked p 63 expression. All other cutaneous metastases from internal adenocarcinomas were negative for p 63. Analysis of p 63 expression may assist in the differential diagnosis of primary <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> versus metastatic visceral adenocarcinomas to the skin. Metastases from <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> generally retain p 63 expression similar to their associated primary tumors...|$|R

30|$|A curious detail {{regarding}} {{the origin of}} most ovarian HGSC in patients with HBOC, suggested by recent studies of prophylactically removed ovaries, is that instead of arising primarily from the ovary as originally assumed, these tumours actually seem to arise from the fallopian tube fimbriae and are characterized by p 53 signature mutations, typical of tubal intraepithelial carcinomas. In addition, these studies failed to identify reproducible precursor lesions in the ovaries [2, 12]. For these reasons, some experts consider ovarian and fallopian tube cancer in BRCA-mutations carriers to be more properly termed as <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> [19]. However, interpretation of p 53 signatures, defined as p 53 positivity by immunohistochemical staining in at least 12 secretory cells with a low proliferative index, must be done cautiously, as {{it does not mean}} a neoplastic lesion is present and is a quite common occurrence in fallopian tubes, regardless of BRCA status [12].|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} descriptive {{epidemiological data}} of malignant mucosal and uveal melanomas and <b>adnexal</b> skin <b>carcinomas</b> in Europe as defined {{as in the}} RARECARE project. We analysed 8669 incident cases registered in the period 1995 - 2002 by 76 population-based cancer registries (CRs), and followed up for vital status to 31 st December 2003. Age-standardised incidence to the European standard population was obtained restricting the analysis to 8416 cancer cases collected by 64 not specialised CRs or with information available only for some anatomical sites. Period survival rates at 2000 - 2002 were estimated on 45 CRs data. Twenty-two CRs which covered the period 1988 - 2002 were analysed to obtain the 15 -year prevalence (1 st January 2003 as reference date). Complete prevalence was calculated by using the completeness index method which estimates surviving cases diagnosed prior to 1988 ('unobserved' prevalence). The expected number of new cases per year and of prevalent cases in Europe was then obtained multiplying the crude incidence and complete prevalence rates to the European population at 2008. We estimated 5204 new cases per year (10. 5 per million) to occur in Europe, of which 48. 7 % were melanomas of uvea, 24. 8 % melanomas of mucosa and 26. 5 % <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> of the skin. Five-year relative survival was 40. 6 % and 68. 9 % for mucosal and uveal melanomas, respectively. <b>Adnexal</b> skin <b>carcinomas</b> showed a good prognosis with a survival of 87. 7 % 5 years after diagnosis. Northern Europe, United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland showed the highest 5 -year survival rate for uveal melanomas (72. 6 % and 73. 4 %), while Southern Europe showed the lowest rate (63. 7 %). More than 50, 000 persons with a past diagnosis {{of one of these}} rare cancers were estimated to be alive at 2008 in Europe, most of them (58. 8 %, n= 29, 676) being patients with uveal melanoma. Due to the good prognosis and high incidence of uveal melanomas, these malignancies are highly represented among the long-term survivors of the studied rare cancer types. Therefore, maximising quality of life is particularly important in treatment of uveal melanoma. As regards mucosal melanomas, the centralisation of treatment to a select number of specialist centres as well as the establishment of expert pathology panels should be promoted. The geographical differences in incidence and survival should be further investigated analysing the centre of treatment, the stage at diagnosis and the treatment...|$|R

40|$|Microcystic <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> is an aggressive, locally {{destructive}} cutaneous neoplasm with a {{high rate}} of recurrence. This tumor is often misdiagnosed clinically and histologically. It usually occurs in middle-aged to older adults. We describe a 44 -year-old man with a large microcystic <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinoma</b> that was present for more than 20 years. The tumor invaded the perichondrium, muscle, nerve, and blood vessel adventitia. A review of the literature suggests that these tumors are often histologically misdiagnosed because the biopsy specimens may be too small to reveal all the characteristic histologic features. The clinical presence of marked induration, a smooth surface, and, possibly, sensory changes should alert the clinician to the possibility of this neoplasm. The initial biopsy specimen must be large enough to demonstrate the identifying histologic features. Mohs surgery is currently the treatment of choice for microcystic <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinoma,</b> as it often spreads far beyond clinically evident tumor...|$|E

40|$|Expression of S 100 A 6 {{protein in}} a broad {{spectrum}} of cutaneous tumors using tissue microarrays Background: S 100 A 6, a calcium-binding protein in the S 100 family, has been observed in melanocytic nevi, neural tumors, fibrohistiocytic tumors and is overexpressed in melanoma. Previous studies reported S 100 A 6 expression in atypical fibroxanthomas (AFX) but not in a small number of desmoplastic melanomas (DM). Limited data on S 100 A 6 expression in cutaneous epithelial tumors exists in the literature. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the specificity and sensitivity of S 100 A 6 protein in a spectrum of cutaneous mesenchymal or epithelial tumors. Methods: Tissue microarrays of cutaneous epithelial neoplasms, mesenchymal neoplasms, DM and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) were stained with S 100 A 6 antibody. Results: Eleven basal cell carcinomas (BCC) failed to express S 100 A 6, whereas all 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) expressed S 100 A 6. Four of seven microcystic <b>adnexal</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (MAC) stained for S 100 A 6. Tumors with duct differentiation variously expressed S 100 A 6 protein, with two hidradenomas showing the strongest staining. Malignant spindle cell tumors, with the exception of 13 of 30 MPNST, had a high incidence of S 100 A 6 positivity. Conclusions: S 100 A 6 expression may distinguish SCC from BCC, MAC from BCC and hidradenoma from other adnexal tumors. S 100 A 6 expression favors DM over MPNST but overlap limits its diagnostic use. Fullen DR, Garrisi AJ, Sanders D, Thomas D.

MÃ‰TODOS: Foram analisados retrospectivamente os prontuÃ¡rios de 21 pacientes submetidos Ã  exenteraÃ§Ã£o entre agosto de 1998 e maio de 2003. Foram avaliados dados referentes a idade, sexo, raÃ§a, local de origem da lesÃ£o, acuidade visual prÃ©-operatÃ³ria, tempo de evoluÃ§Ã£o da doenÃ§a, cirurgias prÃ©vias, complicaÃ§Ãµes pÃ³s-operatÃ³rias, diagnÃ³stico histopatolÃ³gico e uso de tratamento adjuvante antes e/ou apÃ³s a cirurgia. RESULTADOS: A idade mÃ©dia dos pacientes (12 homens e 9 mulheres) foi de 58, 5 anos, sendo a maioria caucasianos. Todos os pacientes apresentavam neoplasias malignas primÃ¡rias, sendo 12 de origem palpebral, 6 conjuntivais e 3 orbitÃ¡rias. O {{carcinoma}} espinocelular foi a doenÃ§a mais freqÃ¼ente (52, 4 %).

PURPOSE: To {{review all}} cases of orbit exenteration {{performed at the}} Orbit Sector, Ophthalmology Department - Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo, from 1998 to 2003. METHODS: We reviewed conditions leading to orbital exenteration in 21 patients at the Orbit Sector of Unifesp-EPM from August 1998 to May 2003. Data regarding sex, age, race, primary lesion site, visual acuity {{at the moment of}} diagnosis, previous surgeries related to the exenteration, type of performed surgery, histopathologic diagnosis, postoperative complications and use of adjuvant treatment were collected. RESULTS: 21 patient charts were retrospectively analyzed. Ages ranged from 5 to 91 years (mean of 58. 5 years). Of these, 12 were male and 9 were female, most of them Caucasian. All lesions that led to exenteration were malignant neoplasias; however, none were metastatic. Lesions originated from eyelids in twelve patients, from bulbar conjunctiva in six and from the orbit in three. Cases were also classified as squamous cell carcinoma (eleven cases), basal cell carcinoma (four cases), sebaceous gland carcinoma (two cases), rhabdomyosarcoma (two cases), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (one case) and <b>adnexal</b> microcistic <b>carcinoma</b> (one case). Visual acuity at the moment of diagnosis ranged from 20 / 40 to no light perception. Only six patients had been submitted to previous surgeries related to the exenteration. After surgery, three patients suffered graft necrosis, one presented ethmoidal sinus fistula to the orbit and one presented orbital socket shrinkage.
