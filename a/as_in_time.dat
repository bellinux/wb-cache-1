25|$|Mating {{outside the}} fertile window of their ovarian cycle may incur {{considerable}} costs for females, such <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and energy usage. To counteract these costs, the male assistance hypothesis argues that females exhibit extended sexuality to obtain resources from males. These resources vary between species, but can include food, social alliance, {{and protection of}} the female and her offspring. For example, in the Trobriand tribe, men give women gifts in exchange for sexual access. From this hypothesis, three predictions can be made.|$|E
25|$|Guillotine gates. Some locks have {{vertically}} moving steel gates – {{these are}} quite common on river navigations in East Anglia. Sometimes {{just one of}} the pairs of swinging gates is replaced by a guillotine: for instance at Salterhebble Locks, where space to swing the balance beams of bottom gates of the lowest lock was restricted by bridge widening. On the River Nene most locks have this arrangement <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of flood the top mitre gates are chained open and the bottom guillotines lifted so that the lock chamber acts as an overflow sluice. Guillotine gates are also used on the downstream side of larger locks such as the 23m Bollène lock on the River Rhône, the aperture being large enough for a boat to travel under it.|$|E
500|$|Section 30(1) of the 1988 Act {{provides}} that the fair dealing exception is valid if {{the material is}} being copied for criticism or review. For it to apply, the infringer {{must be able to}} show that the dealing was for criticism or review, that the infringed work was previously made available to the public, that the dealing was fair, and that the dealing was accompanied by an acknowledgement. The first step requires the defendant to show that the copying was done to criticise or review the work in question, the performance of the work, or, as in Beloff v Pressdram, another work. The courts will interpret [...] "criticism or review" [...] liberally, as in Newspaper Licensing Agency v Marks & Spencers plc, and as such the criticism or review can include the thought or philosophy of the work, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>Time</b> Warner v Channel 4, or the social and moral implications of the work, as in Pro Sieben Media v Carlton Television.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is usually}} one {{dominant}} mature stallion for every mixed-sex herd of horses. The dominant stallion in the herd will tolerate both sexes of horses while young, {{but once they}} become sexually mature, often as yearlings or two-year-olds, the stallion will drive both colts and fillies from the herd. [...] Colts may present competition for the stallion, but studies suggest that driving off young horses of both sexes may also be an instinctive behavior that minimizes the risk of inbreeding within the herd, as most young are the offspring of the dominant stallion in the group. [...] In some cases, a single younger mature male may be tolerated {{on the fringes of}} the herd. [...] One theory is that this young male is considered a potential successor, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> the younger stallion will eventually drive out the older herd stallion.|$|E

2500|$|Simultaneously in San Francisco, {{composer}} Stan Shaff {{and equipment}} designer Doug McEachern, presented the first “Audium” concert at San Francisco State College (1962), {{followed by a}} work at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1963), conceived of <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> controlled movement of sound in space. Twelve speakers surrounded the audience, four speakers were mounted on a rotating, mobile-like construction above. In an SFMOMA performance the following year (1964), San Francisco Chronicle music critic Alfred Frankenstein commented, [...] "the possibilities of the space-sound continuum have seldom been so extensively explored". In 1967, the first Audium, a [...] "sound-space continuum" [...] opened, holding weekly performances through 1970. In 1975, enabled by seed money from the National Endowment for the Arts, a new Audium opened, designed floor to ceiling for spatial sound composition and performance. “In contrast, there are composers who manipulated sound space by locating multiple speakers at various locations in a performance space and then switching or panning the sound between the sources. In this approach, the composition of spatial manipulation {{is dependent on the}} location of the speakers and usually exploits the acoustical properties of the enclosure. Examples include Varese's Poeme Electronique (tape music performed in the Philips Pavilion of the 1958 World Fair, Brussels) and Stanley Schaff's [...] Audium installation, currently active in San Francisco” Through weekly programs (over 4,500 in 40 years), Shaff “sculpts” sound, performing now-digitized spatial works live through 176 speakers.|$|E

On this Lord Macartney grounds his calculations, and on this they choose to ground theirs. It was on this calculation that the ministry, in direct opposition to the remonstrances of the Court of Directors, have compelled that miserable enslaved body to put their hands to an order for appropriating the enormous sum of 480,000l. annually, as a fund for paying to their rebellious servants a debt contracted in defiance of their clearest and most positive injunctions.|$|E

6000|$|This Madonna, {{with the}} {{sculpture}} round her, represents the culminating power of Gothic {{art in the}} thirteenth century. Sculpture has been gaining continually in the interval; gaining, simply because becoming every day more truthful, more tender, and more suggestive. By the way, the old Douglas motto, [...] "Tender and true," [...] may wisely be taken up again by all of us, for our own, in art no less than in other things. Depend upon it, the first universal characteristic of all great art is Tenderness, as the second is Truth. I find this more and more every day: an infinitude of tenderness is the chief gift and inheritance of all the truly great men. It is sure to involve a relative intensity of disdain towards base things, and an appearance of sternness and arrogance {{in the eyes of}} all hard, stupid, and vulgar people--quite terrific to such, if they are capable of terror, and hateful to them, if they are capable of nothing higher than hatred. Dante's is the great type of this class of mind. I say the first inheritance is Tenderness-- the second Truth, because the Tenderness is in the make of the creature, the Truth in his acquired habits and knowledge; besides, the love comes first in dignity as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> and that is always pure and complete: the truth, at best, imperfect.|$|E
