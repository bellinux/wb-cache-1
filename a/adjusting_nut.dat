50|$|In {{a common}} type of {{stuffing}} box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just {{enough to make the}} seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.|$|E
50|$|Most guitars {{nowadays}} {{are manufactured}} with rather high string action and high conventional nuts. The user {{is expected to}} <b>adjust</b> <b>nut</b> height to their personal playing style. Unfortunately sales personnel in music stores DO know about that, but lack the skill and often skilled luthiers are not within reach; {{not to mention the}} extra time and/or cost to properly set up a guitar in what has become very price competitive, low profit product. Guitars with zero frets would be helpful in that situation.|$|R

The receiver has an integral [...]22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7-round metal magazine, a tool for <b>adjusting</b> the barrel <b>nut,</b> and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10-round nickel plated metal magazines. 25-round magazines are available.|$|R
5000|$|A {{captured}} Type 97 mortar, {{which has}} been studied in detail, was marked [...] "Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> of the Japanese mortar {{is on the right}} bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the traversing and elevating screws of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the clevis joint and grease fittings dissimilar to those used by the US model.|$|E
50|$|The Type 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb {{lighter than the}} Type 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created largely by {{the elimination of the}} Type 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of the Type 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on the Type 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of the Type 97 which is not on the Type 94, and the sliding bracket of the Type 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on the Type 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship were made in the manufacture of the Type 97. The bipod feet and chain hooks were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on the Type 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on the Type 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut,</b> sliding bracket, and hand wheels of the Type 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in the Type 94.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the Type 99 and the US 81-mm mortar, M1 are more pronounced. The tube length of the Japanese weapon is only about half that of the US mortar 59.5 inches vs 25.5 inches. Of much greater significance, however, is {{the difference in the}} method of firing. Whereas the Type 97 has a fixed firing pin in the base cap, the Type 99 has its firing pin affixed to a camshaft that extends outside the base cap of the mortar. This shaft must be struck a sharp blow with a mallet to drive it inward so as to force the firing pin against the primer of the propellant cartridge. The primer ignites the propellant charge of the cartridge, which in turn ignites the powder increments attached to the fins. The weapon fires with an exceptionally loud report and a pronounced muzzle flash. When the firing pin camshaft is struck, the camshaft spring is extended. When it snaps back into its original shape, it withdraws the camshaft thus bringing the firing pin down into the base cap in position for the next shot. In addition to the different methods of firing, the Japanese weapon also employs a turnbuckle for cross-leveling instead of an <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> and connecting rod, and its recoil mechanism also differs from that of the US piece. Finally, the Japanese base plate has only one socket for the base cap knob, and it is not provided with a sighting line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Two {{fractured}} pins {{of impact}} wrench {{were evaluated by}} fractography using scanning electron microscopy. This pneumatic wrench is used to the fabrication of automotive components being characterized by its power and tightening capacity. The {{important part of the}} wrench is the pin clutch impact mechanism used to generate high torque. An original pin manufactured with AISI E 52100 steel <b>adjusted</b> 2, 580 <b>nuts</b> before fracture and a substitute pin of E 52100 modified steel with S <b>adjusted</b> 7, 095 <b>nuts</b> before failure. Fractographic analysis in both fracture surfaces indicated a ductile-brittle mixed fracture mode. Original pin surface exhibited a granular appearance while substitute pin surface showed fibrous and rough morphology. Precipitation of nearly rounded, elliptical and elongate second – phase particles containing Cr, C and Mn measured as intergranular and transgranular particle density was observed, promoting some brittle failure zones and ductile fracture measured as the volume fraction of grain boundaries and microvoids, respectively. A larger amount of intergranular medium precipitates was found on the original pin which favored the brittle failure among the grain boundaries compared to that of the substitute pin. The ductile fracture by larger transgranular fine particle density which acted as nucleation sites of higher volume fraction of microvoids was found in the substitute pin...|$|R
50|$|In most {{pendulum}} clocks {{the rate}} is adjusted by moving the bob up or down on the pendulum rod. Moving it up shortens the pendulum, making it beat more quickly, and causing the clock to gain time. In the most common arrangement, the bob {{is attached to the}} pendulum with an adjustment nut at the bottom, on the threaded end of the pendulum rod. Turning the <b>nut</b> <b>adjusts</b> the height of the bob. But some bobs have levers or dials to adjust the height. In some precision clocks there is a smaller auxiliary weight on a threaded shaft to allow more fine adjustment. Tower clocks sometimes have a tray mounted on the pendulum rod, to which small weights can be added or removed, to adjust the rate without stopping the clock.|$|R
5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a stuffing box, also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept <b>adjusting</b> and locking <b>nuts.</b> A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the stuffing box. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} make {{environmental}} test centrifuge balance automatically and accurately, reduce unbalance centrifugal force, balance adjusting system of centrifuge is designed. The new balance adjusting system comprises motor-reducer, timing belt, screw pair, slider-guideway and four rocker force sensors. According to information obtained by the four rocker force sensors, unbalanced value {{at both ends of}} the big arm is computed and heavy block is moved to achieve balance adjusting. In this paper, motor power and torque to move the heavy block is calculated. In full load running progress of centrifuge, the stress-strain of screw pair composed by <b>adjusting</b> <b>nut</b> and big arm are analyzed. A successful application of the balance adjusting system is also put forwarded. The results show that the balance adjusting system can satisfy balance require of environmental test centrifuge.

50|$|Persons {{wishing to}} make {{adjustments}} to the Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism must become familiar {{not only with the}} use of the dual-sided nut (that fits in the hole in the front of the receiver) but also how that nut is locked in-place (so that it will not accidentally turn once it has been set as desired). What appears to be a flat blade screw head on the right side of the Model 241's receiver, that can easily be mistaken as a screw to lock the dual-sided nut in place, is actually a cosmetic affectation on what has sometimes been described as a 'slug' (instead of having threads on its sides as would a screw it has smooth sides). While the slug does indeed press (inside the receiver) against the outside of the dual-sided nut (and thus keeps the dual-sided nut from rotating) it does not have its pressure against the outside of the dual-sided <b>nut</b> <b>adjusted</b> by rotating (as it would were it a screw) but instead the slug is held pressing against the outside of the dual-sided nut by first being simply pushed against the outside of the dual-sided nut (by pressing down on the slug's flat blade screw head appearance on the right side of the receiver) and then a screw (the actual locking-screw) presses against the side of the slug (inside the receiver) and thus prevents it from moving. That locking-screw is oriented such that it comes in (to press against the side of the slug) from the direction of the front face of the receiver (and so is only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver).|$|R
