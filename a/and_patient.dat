5|$|Greenlandic verbs inflect for {{agreement}} with agent <b>and</b> <b>patient,</b> for mood and for voice. There are eight moods, of which four {{are used in}} independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses. The four independent moods are: indicative, interrogative, imperative, optative. The four dependent moods are causative, conditional, contemporative, and participial. Verbal roots can take transitive, intransitive or negative inflections, so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms. The inflectional system is further {{complicated by the fact}} that transitive suffixes encode both agent <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> in a single morpheme, requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> for each of the eight transitive paradigms. As some moods do not have forms for all persons (imperative only has 2nd person, optative only 1st and 3rd person, participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person), the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318.|$|E

40|$|Patient-reported {{outcomes}} (PROs) {{are increasingly}} considered important. We developed a web-based application to electronically assess PROs in routine dermatological practice. We assessed (1) {{the relevance of}} PRO measurement according to health care providers <b>and</b> <b>patients,</b> (2) the feasibility of our application in routine practice according to health care providers, supporting staff <b>and</b> <b>patients,</b> <b>and</b> (3) barriers/facilitators for implementation according to health care providers and supporting staff. Health care providers, supporting staff <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> completed study-specific questionnaires. Also, website statistics were analysed. 3 / 6 clinics participated, including 9 professionals <b>and</b> 80 <b>patients.</b> Both health care providers <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> rated PRO measurement as relevant. However, implementation was only moderately feasible. Time constraints and logistical problems were mentioned as barriers, <b>and</b> motivated <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> supportive staff as facilitators. Electronic PRO assessment in routine practice is not self-evident. Adjustments in logistics are recommended to optimize implementation, using a plan-do-study-act approac...|$|R

40|$|The {{value of}} digital {{systolic}} blood pressure (DBP) and flow (DBF) measure-ments for a quantitative diagnosis of Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon (PRP) was evaluated {{by comparing the results}} obtained in 10 <b>patients</b> <b>and</b> 20 normals. Digital skin temperature (DST), DBP and brachial {{systolic blood pressure}} (BBP) and DBF were measured at room temperature, at maximal vasodilatation and during cold provocation. At room temperature DST discriminates between normals <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> with an accuracy of 77 %. On maximum vasodilatation no significant differences can be found in DBP and DBF between normals <b>and</b> <b>patients.</b> However, DBF was significantly different between male and females both in normals <b>and</b> in <b>patients.</b> During gradual cooling a decrease in DBF (a closing phenomenon) was observed both in normals <b>and</b> <b>patients.</b> In contrast DBP did not show a substantial pressure drop. Calculating digit to brachial systolic pressure indexes (DBI) a slight significant increase can be found during cold provocation both in normals <b>and</b> in <b>patients.</b> Only the DBI of digit IV during cold provocation showed a significant differ-ence between normals <b>and</b> <b>patients</b> which resulted in an accuracy of 83 %...|$|R

5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle <b>and</b> <b>patient.</b> Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations.

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E

5|$|As a teacher, Sudirman {{taught his}} {{students}} lessons on morality using {{examples from the}} lives of the prophets and traditional wayang stories. One of his students later recalled that Sudirman was an even-handed <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> teacher who would mix humour and nationalism in his lessons; this made him popular with the students. A hard-working teacher despite poor pay, within several years Sudirman had become headmaster despite not having a teacher's certificate. As a result, his monthly wages quadrupled from three gulden to twelve and a half. As headmaster, Sudirman worked on numerous administrative duties, including finding middle ground between feuding teachers. A coworker later recalled that Sudirman was a moderate, democratic leader. He was also active in fundraising, both for the needs of his school and the construction of others.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s, the city's {{economy had}} {{recovered}} after 30 years of economic downturn. A {{large number of}} high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston's Back Bay during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> care. Schools such as Boston College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music, and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
5|$|In late 1954 Reich {{began an}} affair with Grethe Hoff, a former patient. Hoff was married to another former student <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> of his, the {{psychologist}} Myron Sharaf, who decades later, with his Fury on Earth (1983), became Reich's main biographer. Hoff and Sharaf had had their first child the year before Hoff left him for Reich; the marriage was never repaired although the affair had ended by June 1955. Two months later Reich began another relationship, this time with Aurora Karrer, a medical researcher, and, in November, he moved out of Orgonon to an apartment in Alban Towers, Washington, D.C., to live with her, using the pseudonym Dr. Walter Roner.|$|E

She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated and hard-working student, but he routinely panics when he tries to drive a boat and fails every driving test he takes. His failures often result in crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob's unintentional recklessness exasperating.
