While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as <b>a</b> <b>uniformed</b> officer.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions than he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending <b>a</b> <b>uniformed</b> officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the city of Los Angeles, in the year 1947, with players {{assuming}} the role of Los Angeles Police Department officer, and later detective, Cole Phelps. The game starts with Phelps as <b>a</b> <b>uniformed</b> patrolman, and follows his career as he advances through the police department bureaus (desks) of Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk gives players a new partner who will help Phelps in his investigation of a number of cases based on a specific type of crime. The game assigns players with cases that they must solve. After each case, players receive a rating of 1–5 stars depending on their performance in both interrogations and searching for clues. In some cases, when searching an area for clues to the crime, players can also find newspapers. Besides reading the story, the newspapers give access to a short cinematic that either covers a part of the game's overarching plot or a flashback to Phelps' war memories. Near the end of the final desk, players assume control of private investigator Jack Kelso, who becomes the player character for {{most of the rest of}} the game; although different in appearance and personality, he controls identically to Phelps.|$|E
