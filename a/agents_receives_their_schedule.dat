40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} coordinating the vehicular traffic at an intersection and on the branches leading to it for minimizing a combination of total travel time and energy consumption. We propose a provably safe hierarchical-distributed solution to balance computational complexity and optimality of the system operation. In our design, a central intersection manager communicates with vehicles heading towards the intersection, groups them into clusters (termed bubbles) as they appear, and determines an optimal schedule of passage through the intersection for each bubble. The vehicles in each bubble <b>receive</b> <b>their</b> <b>schedule</b> and implement local distributed control to ensure system-wide inter-vehicular safety while respecting speed and acceleration limits, conforming to the assigned schedule, and seeking to optimize their individual trajectories. Our analysis rigorously establishes that the {{different aspects of the}} hierarchical design operate in concert and that the safety guarantees provided by the proposed design are satisfied. We illustrate its execution in a suite of simulations and compare its performance to traditional signal-based coordination over a wide range of system parameters...|$|R

25|$|Six {{months after}} the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson {{announced}} he would seek to prevent PEF members from <b>receiving</b> <b>their</b> <b>scheduled</b> 4 percent salary increase and seek furloughs of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two {{months after the}} pension deal was reached. PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker. On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do so. About a week later, Paterson withheld the pay increase unilaterally, leading to strong denunciations by the union. Two weeks later, Paterson announced he would seek to furlough half the state's workforce one day a week {{for the rest of the}} year in addition to the wage freeze, and the state legislature appeared ready to agree to the plan. PEF began a legislative lobbying effort, but the legislature approved the furloughs. PEF and other unions sued to overturn the pay freeze and furloughs, and a federal district court temporarily prevented the state from implementing the furlough plan on May 11, 2010. The court also ordered the state to restore the wage increase. The court made the injunction permanent about two weeks later.|$|R

The Atkinson character was dropped after the ninth episode of this season, and Steve was given a promotion, becoming IADC Director, and Diana's boss, in the process. This promotion for Steve Trevor meant that Lyle Waggoner was seen less in subsequent episodes {{for the remainder of the}} series' run.

The {{following}} year saw the school move into its new campus whose buildings were specifically designed for Los Al's unique flexible scheduling program (and the addition of juniors, followed by seniors the next year). During its first two years, Los Alamitos High School had a complete flexible schedule program.

40|$|For {{editorial}} comment see p 819. Context Treatment recommendations {{assume that}} repeated mass antibiotic distributions can control, but not eradicate or even locally eliminate, the ocular strains of chlamydia that cause trachoma. Elimination {{may be an}} important end point because of concern that infection will return to communities that have lost immunity to chlamydia after antibiotics are discontinued. Objective To determine whether biannual treatment can eliminate ocular chlamydial infection from preschool children and to compare results with the World Health Organization–recommended annual treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants A cluster-randomized clinical trial of biannual vs annual mass azithromycin administrations to all residents of 16 rural villages in the Gurage Zone, Ethiopia, from March 2003 to April 2005. Interventions At scheduled treatments, all individuals aged 1 year or older were offered a single dose of oral azithromycin either annually or biannually. Main Outcome Measure Village prevalence of ocular chlamydial infection and presence of elimination at 24 months in preschool children determined by polymerase chain reaction, correcting for baseline prevalence. Antibiotic treatments were performed after sample collections. Results Overall, 14 897 of 16 403 eligible individuals (90. 8 %) <b>received</b> <b>their</b> <b>scheduled</b> treatment. In the villages in which residents were treated annually, the prevalence of infection in preschool children was reduced from a mean of 42. 6 % (range, 14. 7 %- 56. 4 %) to 6. 8 % (range, 0. 0 %- 22. 0 %) at 24 months. In the villages in which residents were treated biannually, infection was reduced from 31. 6 % pretreatment (range, 6. 1 %- 48. 6 %) to 0. 9 % (range, 0. 0 %- 4. 8 %) at 24 months.

Students were assessed with the Pattern of Adaptive Learning Scales’ (PALS) Academic Efficacy subscale to control for prior academic self-efficacy. The same two instruments were used as posttests with questions arranged in a different order. Analysis showed no significant difference in students’ Spanish achievement between students who used Duolingo® and students who were taught with traditional means. Similarly, analysis showed no significant difference in students’ academic self-efficacy who were taught with Duolingo® versus those who were taught with traditional face-to-face instruction.

40|$|International audienceMultirobot {{systems have}} made {{tremendous}} progress in exploration and surveillance. However, information gathering tasks remain passive: the <b>agents</b> <b>receive</b> information from <b>their</b> sensors without acting {{in order to}} gather it.

To do so, we propose a distributed de-cision process where a robot maintains a belief matrix representing its beliefs and beliefs about the beliefs of the other robots. This deci-sion process uses entropy and Hellinger distance in a reward function to access the relevance of their beliefs and their divergence with the other robots. This model allows to derive a policy for gathering in-formation to make the entropy low and a communication policy to reduce the divergence between robot's beliefs.

We consider a three-period model of the variable value environment where <b>agents</b> <b>receive</b> signals about <b>their</b> values in the first and the third periods and in the second period they take actions. This setting captures essential features of auctions of objects available for use at a future date (e. g., a sale of a military base scheduled to close in a few years). We study mechanisms that lead to efficient allocations, i. e. those in which the final value of the object to the winning bidder net of the total cost of private actions undertaken by all agents is maximized.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety of}} CSL's split-virion inactivated trivalent 2009 Southern Hemisphere formulation influenza vaccine (TIV) in children. METHODS: We enrolled 1992 healthy children into three groups: Cohorts A, ≥ 6 months to < 3 years; B, ≥ 3 years to < 9 years; and C, ≥ 9 years to < 18 years. Children received one or two doses of 0. 25 ml (22. 5 μg haemagglutinin) or 0. 5 ml (45 μg) TIV, depending on age and prior vaccination history. We collected post-vaccination solicited adverse event (AE) data (days 0 - 6), including fever (temperature: ≥ 37. 5 °C axilla, ≥ 38. 0 °C oral), unsolicited AEs (days 0 - 29) and serious AEs (SAEs) and new-onset chronic illnesses (NOCIs; to day 180 after last vaccination). RESULTS: At least one solicited AE was reported by 80 %/ 78 %/ 78 % of children in Cohorts A, B and C, respectively. Systemic AEs were more common among Cohort A (72 % of participants), and local AEs were more common among Cohort C (71 % of participants). Fever was more common in younger cohorts, in influenza vaccine-naïve children (29 % of Cohort A <b>receiving</b> <b>their</b> first dose), and following first compared with second doses. Severe fever following a first dose prevented 20 participants <b>receiving</b> <b>their</b> second <b>scheduled</b> vaccine dose. A 7 -month-old participant had a single uncomplicated febrile convulsion {{on the day of}} vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 80 % of subjects reported at least one solicited AE following immunization. Fever prevalence was highest in vaccine-naïve Cohort A participants, similar to other paediatric studies using CSL vaccine. Further research to understand fever-related AEs in children following CSL's TIV is recommended. Stephen B. Lambert, Lai-man R. Chuk, Michael D. Nissen, Terry M.
