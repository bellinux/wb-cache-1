40|$|The {{quality of}} {{irrigation}} water {{has the potential}} to significantly affect soil structural properties, infiltration and irrigation application efficiency. While the effect of electrolyte concentration (as indicated by the electrical conductivity EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) have been studied under laboratory conditions, the effect on soil profile structural properties and irrigation performance have not been widely investigated under field conditions. In this paper, water with three different levels of sodium (SAR = 0. 9, 10 and 30) was applied as alternative treatments to a clay loam soil. The application of 238 – 261 mm of medium- to high-SAR water was found to reduce aggregate stability, increase the bulk density of both the surface crust and underlying soil, and reduce the total depth of infiltration and final infiltration rate. Where low-SAR water was used, there was no significant (P< 0. 05) difference in final infiltration rate after the first four irrigations. However, where moderate- and high-SAR water was applied after the first four irrigations with the low EC-SAR water, the final infiltration rate was found to decrease on each of the successive irrigation events. For the moderate- and high-SAR treatments, this suggests that a steady-state equilibrium had not been reached within that part of the soil profile impeding infiltration. It is proposed that the initial reduction in infiltration is related to the physical processes of slaking leading to the development of an <b>apedal,</b> hardsetting surface soil layer. Similarly, it is proposed that the subsequent increase in bulk density and decline in infiltration where moderate and high EC-SAR water is applied is due to an increase in clay tactoid swelling reducing the size of the conducting micropores, dispersion blocking pores, and/or an increase in the thickness of the <b>apedal</b> surface layer. The reduction in infiltration {{associated with the use of}} high-SAR irrigation water was found to reduce the performance of the irrigations, with the application efficiency of the final irrigation decreasing from 40 % where the low-SAR water was used, to 21 % where the high-SAR water was applied. The implications for surface irrigating with water containing high sodium levels are discussed...|$|E

S. and ·its influence on the production of maize are discussed. Morphologic characteristics, typically associated with soils are grey matrix colours, soft plinthite, yellow brown <b>apedal</b> B-horizons and E-horizons. Observations in piezometers, installed at various localities in the research area, suggest that the free water accumulates on paleo-surfaces. The paleo-surfaces, covered by solums derived from aeolian sand, consists of gleyed clayey paleosols or the weathering products of underlying rocks. The free water is phreatic and its presence over long periods can be inferred from the morphology of the soil. High concentrations of cations and anions in the free water reach the root zones and influence the nutrition of plants. The height of capillary rise to the rootzone for different flood densities was calculated to evaluate the influence of fluctuating water tables on the supply of water to plants. The maximum height of capillary rise in clay, calcrete, hard plinthite and sand was measured. A · technique was developed for this purpose. Various implements used by farmers in the area for tillage of sandy soils, were evaluated. A threetine ripper gave the best results. Experiments to evaluate the influence of water content and various implements on the compaction of soils were used to set guidelines for tillage-practices in the area investigated. Collapse settlement took place with saturation, causing consolidation which eliminate the positive effect of tillage; In oedometer tests, the internal resistance against compaction exceeded matrix potential at void ratios of 0, 71 and less. The pore diameter, where the internal resistance against compression equals matrix potential, was calculated experimentally as 0, 0327 mm. Extremely high water tables are unfavourable for the cultivation of maize. Water tables that reach the roots, through capillary action, but fluctuates deeper than the depth of tillage, will supply water to plants during dry periods, without resulting in harmful anaerobic conditions. Soils with water tables fluctuating within this reach during the growth season, could be advantageous for the cultivation of maize. Soil in which water tables are too deep for capillary water to reach the root zone, may regarded be as high risk soils. Doctora...|$|E

40|$|The term 'earthy fabric ' {{has been}} used in Australia for several decades and {{commonly}} refers to <b>apedal,</b> coherent soil material with numerous pores (e. g. Northcote 1979, McDonald et al. 1990). In sandy materials the earthiness may be attributed to a combination of clay and sesquioxide coatings of the mostly quartz sand and the packing of these grains. The developed coherence distinguishes it from single grain sand since in the dry state the latter completely collapses when disrupted. In contrast the former retains coherence until sufficient force is applied at which point a puff of fine dust is often released as collapse occurs. This distinction in behavior is not often appreciated outside soil science for it is common to find both materials described as having a grain support fabric. Even so, the earthy fabric term in soil science is a field-based descriptor. In soil micromorphology a direct equivalence has yet to be firmly established. It best fits some of the grain-coating (chlamydic) and/or partly infilled pore (iunctic) fabrics sequences described by Brewer (1979). The origin of these fabric sequences remains uncertain although repeated wetting and drying and sometimes illuviation is invoked (Brewer et al. 1983). However, in one study the earthy fabric of a topsoil was described as biofabrics produced by soil fauna (Humphreys 1994).

40|$|ABSTRACT Horizons {{with varying}} degrees of {{cementation}} are a common feature of the soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil. In most cases, these horizons are represented by the following subsurface horizons: fragipan, duripan, ortstein, and placic. The aims of this study were to analyze differences regarding the development and the degree of expression of cementation in soils from the coastal tablelands of Northeastern Brazil: Planossolo Háplico (p-SX), Espodossolo Humilúvico (p-EK), Espodossolo Ferrihumilúvico (p-ESK), and Argissolo Acinzentado (p-PAC) pedons. The pedons studied displayed features related to drainage impediments. The cemented horizons from p-SX and p-EK had the same designation (Btgm), displaying a duric character that coincided with gleization features and are under podzolized horizons. In the p-ESK, the podzolization process is of such magnitude that it leads to the cementation of its own spodic horizons, which were both of the ortstein type (Bhsx and Bsm). In the p-PAC cementation is observed in two placic horizons and in the Btx/Bt horizon, {{as well as in the}} upper parts of the Bt/Btx horizon. Analysis of the micrographies from the cemented horizons showed predominance of a low porosity matrix. Such porosity is relatively greater in the horizons of &# 8220;x&# 8221; subscript than in the horizons with duric character. The Fe segregation lines were notable in the cemented horizons from p-EK and p-PAC, which corroborates the presence of placic horizons in such pedons. The preponderance of kaolinite in the clay fraction was widely verified in all the cemented horizons analyzed. Water immersion tests were the criteria adopted to define the duric character of the Btgm horizons from p-SX and p-EK, and in the Bsm horizon from the p-ESK. These tests were also used to confirm field morphology. In most cases, the maximum values of Fe, Al, and Si, determined by different extractions, occurred in positions overlaying the cemented horizons, whether they were spodic or not. The extracts of the aqueous solution displayed a noticeable accumulation of Si in the cemented horizons, except in the p-PAC. The presence of argillans in all cemented horizons allows them to be defined as illuvial, with the exception of the placic horizons, regardless of the presence of podzolization processes. The cemented horizons were preponderantly <b>apedal,</b> with a matrix of little porosity. The Fe, Al, and Si contents extracted by acid ammonium oxalate were effective at highlighting the influence of compounds with a low degree of crystallinity in the morphology of cemented horizons...|$|E
40|$|Structure is an {{important}} physical feature of the soil {{that is associated with}} water movement, the soil atmosphere, microorganism activity and nutrient uptake. A soil without any obvious organisation of its components is known as <b>apedal</b> and this state can have marked effects on several soil processes. Accurate maps of topsoil and subsoil structure are desirable {{for a wide range of}} models that aim to predict erosion, solute transport, or flow of water through the soil. Also such maps would be useful to precision farmers when deciding how to apply nutrients and pesticides in a site-specific way, and to target subsoiling and soil structure stabilization procedures. Typically, soil structure is inferred from bulk density or penetrometer resistance measurements and more recently from soil resistivity and conductivity surveys. To measure the former is both time-consuming and costly, whereas observations made by the latter methods can be made automatically and swiftly using a vehicle-mounted penetrometer or resistivity and conductivity sensors. The results of each of these methods, however, are affected by other soil properties, in particular moisture content at the time of sampling, texture, and the presence of stones. Traditional methods of observing soil structure identify the type of ped and its degree of development. Methods of ranking such observations from good to poor for different soil textures have been developed. Indicator variograms can be computed for each category or rank of structure and these can be summed to give the sum of indicator variograms (SIV). Observations of the topsoil and subsoil structure were made at four field sites where the soil had developed on different parent materials. The observations were ranked by four methods and indicator and the sum of indicator variograms were computed and modelled for each method of ranking. The individual indicators were then kriged with the parameters of the appropriate indicator variogram model to map the probability of encountering soil with the structure represented by that indicator. The model parameters of the SIVs for each ranking system were used with the data to krige the soil structure classes, and the results are compared with those for the individual indicators. The relations between maps of soil structure and selected wavebands from aerial photographs are examined as basis for planning surveys of soil structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Soil Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and identify the occurrence of specific soil properties that may be important for vegetation functioning and the possible effect of the loss of or changes in these properties on rehabilitation success on the sandy coastal plains of the West Coast, South Africa. The study area covered approximately 9 400 ha on the Namaqualand coast in the vicinity of Brand-se-Baai (31 º 18 'S 17 º 54 'E), approximately 350 km north of Cape Town and 70 km north-west of the nearest town, Lutzville. A soil survey was done to reveal the presence of important pedological features. The 20 soil profiles surveyed are situated within six vegetation communities. Pedological features such as surface water repellency, permeable <b>apedal</b> subsurface horizons, subsurface impediments such as cemented (calcrete or dorbank) hardpans and significantly more clayey (cutanic, luvic) horizons were identified. A comparative study between rehabilitated and natural soils indicates that mining operations result in the formation of saline sand tailings, stripped of a large portion of the clay and organic matter fraction. The natural leaching of solutes, over a period of 25 months, is sufficient to lower salinity of the tailings to levels comparable to natural soils. This leaching can also results in lowering of soil fertility. Removal of the dorbank and the dense neocutanic horizon in the western side of the mine, loss of topographical features such as small dune systems and heuweltjies, destruction of natural soil profile morphology and the lowering of organic carbon and clay plus silt fraction can have detrimental effects on attempts at rehabilitation of this area to a natural condition similar to that which preceded the mining operation. Infiltration fingering and deep percolation results in the development of an aquifer below the reach of shallow-rooted desert shrubs. A method of water acquisition by vegetation through water distillation is investigated as a possible solution to the apparent discontinuum between the shallow root systems and deeper-lying aquifer. Volumetric water content measurements indicated that precipitation of 29. 5 mm, over a period of 10 days, did not result in any variation at 235 mm, 360 mm and 900 mm depths. An average volumetric water content increase of 0. 4 mm per night was measured in the first 23. 5 cm of soil surface. This amount is a significant source of water that can explain the shallow root distribution. Water vapour movement due to temperature gradients can explain the diurnal volumetric water content fluctuations observed. Further studies are necessary to determine to what extent the depth of water infiltration influences the capacity of subsurface dew to provide plants with a nocturnal water source. Findings of this study can be summarised into two concepts namely: • Heuweltjies, small dune systems, and variation in depth of cemented hardpans are the main features that contribute to pedosphere variation and possibly to biodiversity. • Pedogenic features such as topsoil hydrophobicity, and cemented dorbank and dense more clayey (cutanic, luvic) subsurface horizons are important components of a soil water distillation process that could be a driving force behind vegetation functioning in this region. Mine activities result in the loss of certain pedogenic features and soil properties that that could be key ingredients to ecosystem functioning. The inability to recognise their significance and ignorance thereof when planning rehabilitation methods might prevent sustainable restoration of the environment...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 0115350 V - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Plant, Animal and Environmental Science - Faculty of ScienceThe {{effect of}} between-tree competition in separate even aged stands of a Eucalyptus grandis seedling {{and a single}} Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla hybrid clone was assessed. This was done by comparing treatments within an experiment, {{that was designed to}} test the effect planting density and genotype had on timber production and stand dynamics through time. This experiment is located on an escarpment in the Summer rainfall region of South Africa, approximately 7 km North West of Albert Falls dam in the Kwa-Zulu Natal Midlands. The terrain is flat with deep <b>apedal</b> soils, and the site has an estimated mean annual precipitation of 1143 mm. The simplest method of evaluating competition effects in plantation stands is through the use of spacing trials. Spacing trials create stands/plots in which all silvicultural and climatic variables are constant. Differences between treatments can then be attributed to competition alone. The planting densities tested were 6667 stems. ha- 1, 3333 stems. ha- 1, 2222 stems. ha- 1, 1587 stems. ha- 1 and 1111 stems. ha- 1 respectively. Competition was measured at three levels, namely; (i) individual tree, (ii) size-class and (iii) stand level. Vigour and its distribution within the population were used to explain competition processes. Basal area was chosen as the size variable for which vigour would be analysed. Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Relative Production Rate (RPR) were chosen as the measures of vigour for analysis. Morphological changes in the trees as a result of competition were also used to understand the competitive mechanisms. It was found that resources are not shared amongst individuals in proportion to their size, but rather the larger individuals use disproportionately more of the resources than the smaller individuals, and therefore competition is asymmetrical. The dominant form of competition was found to be resource pre-emption where larger individuals passively prevent solar resources from reaching smaller competitors. Using RPR as the measure of vigour, competition was found to be one-sided, meaning that smaller individuals do not reduce the vigour of larger ones. If RGR is accepted as the measure of vigour then competition is two-sided meaning that the smaller individuals do reduce the vigour of the larger ones to a certain extent. There was no difference in {{the degree to which the}} smaller competitors in the clonal and seedling treatments reduced the growth of the larger individuals. The self-thinning rate in the seedling treatments was significantly higher than in the clonal treatments. Increases in mean tree size and production per hectare were accompanied by increases in mortality in the seedling treatments. In the clonal treatments it was found that even once the mean tree size approached the self thinning line, very few or no trees died, however there was also very little or no increase in mean tree size. When the relationship between number of live trees and production per hectare was analysed it was found that the clone could increase production per hectare without any change in survivorship, which is contrary to popular theory. As time progressed the skewness of the population progressed from negative to positive. This increase was the most pronounced in the higher planting density treatments, and the clonal treatments. The size variability in the population first decreased, then steadily increased. This increase was more pronounced in the high planting density treatments, and the clonal treatments. Clones and seedlings react in very different ways to competition. The large differences in population dynamics observed, indicate that we cannot just apply knowledge built up over the years regarding the management of Eucalyptus grandis and other plantation species to Eucalyptus hybrid clones...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Soil Science)) [...] Univ ersity of Stellenbosch, 2008. The (semi-) arid Namaqualand {{region on}} the west coast of South Africa is wellknown for its spring flower displays. Due to the aridity of the region, soils {{research}} has lagged behind that of the more agriculturally productive parts of South Africa. However, rehabilitation efforts after the hundred or so years of mining, coupled with the increasing ecology and biodiversity research, have prompted a recent interest in Namaqualand soils as a substrate for plant growth. The area is also notable for the abundance of heuweltjies. Much of the previous heuweltjie-work focussed on biogenic aspects such as their spacing, origin and age, but although heuweltjies are in fact a soil feature, there have been few published studies on the soil forming processes within heuweltjies. However, the depositional history of the sediments on the Namaqualand coastal plain is well constrained, which is {{in stark contrast to the}} paucity of data on their subsequent pedogenesis. Given that the regolith has been subaerially exposed in some parts for much of the Neogene, the soil formation forms an important part of the sediments’ history. The primary aim of this thesis, therefore, was to examine the soil features of the Namaqualand coastal plain to further the understanding of pedogenesis in the region. The regolith of the northern Namaqualand coastal plain, often ten or more metres deep, comprises successive late Tertiary marine packages, each deposited during sea-level regression. The surface soil horizons formed from an aeolian parent material. The relatively low CaCO 3 in the aeolian sands dictated the pedogenic pathway in these deposits. The non-calcareous pathway lead to clay-rich, redder <b>apedal</b> horizons that show a stronger structure with depth, and generally rest directly on marine sands via a subtle discontinuity that suggests pedogenesis continues into the underlying marine facies. The calcareous pathway lead to similar clay-rich, redder <b>apedal</b> B horizons, but which differ in that they are calcareous, and rest on a calcrete horizon often via a stoneline of rounded pebbles. Deeper in the profile, there is generally a regular alteration of sedimentary units, with the upper shoreface facies showing reddening, and the lower shoreface sands remaining pale. This seems to be a function of the grain size, since the upper shoreface materials are coarser, and the redder parts of the lower shoreface are also associated with slightly coarser sands. In some strata the oxidation of glauconite-rich sediments resulted in an orange colour. In an area with abundant heuweltjies, a strongly-cemented calcretized nest was present about 2 m deep within a silica cemented, locally calcareous dorbank profile. Vertical termite burrows are present up to 12 m deep, and appear to have been conduits for preferential vertical flow. Soil formation and termite activity is at least as old as the Last Interglacial. E horizons may have formed in a wetter Last Interglacial paleoclimate, but they are still active in the present day. The Namaqualand coastal plain, with its extensive areas of calcrete development, is almost a textbook setting for calcrete development by inorganic processes. However, these calcretes also show microscale biogenic features. These include M rods, MA rods, and fungal filaments. Abiotic alpha-fabric seems dominant in mature calcrete horizons, and beta-fabric in calcareous nodules in a calcic B horizon above calcrete. The apparent absence of Mg-calcite and dolomite, and abundance of sepiolite in the calcretes of coastal Namaqualand suggests that these Mg-rich clay minerals are the main Mg-bearing phase. Deformation (pseudo-anticlines) in the calcrete appear to result primarily from the displacive effect of calcite crystallization. Although evidence of shrink/swell behaviour is present in the form of accommodating planes, it does not appear to be as volumetrically significant as displacive calcite. Indurated light-coloured horizons that resembled calcrete but are non- to mildly calcareous, break with a conchoidal fracture, resist slaking in both acid and alkali, turn methyl-orange purple, and show a bulk-soil sepiolite XRD peak are similar to palygorskite-cemented material (‘palycrete’) from Spain and Portugal, and so were tentatively named ‘sepiocrete’. Sepiolite and palygorskite are often reported from arid region soils but there has been no recorded cementation of soils by sepiolite. The degree of induration in some of these horizons suggest that amorphous silica could play a role in cementation, and so this thesis compares the two silica-cemented horizons encountered in Namaqualand (silcrete and dorbank (petroduric)) to these ‘sepiocrete’ horizons. Both silica and sepiolite are present in the matrix, although the degree to which silica and sepiolite dominate seems to vary even within same horizon. It seems most probable that both contribute to the structural properties of the horizon. Sepiolitic horizons do not form a diagnostic horizon in the World Reference Base, Soil Taxonomy, or the South African system. To fit the existing soil classification schemes, the terms ‘sepiolitic’ and ‘petrosepiolitic’ (in the same sense as ‘calcic’ and ‘petrocalcic’) would be appropriate. The term ‘sepiolitic’ should be used for horizons which: contain sepiolite in amounts great enough for it to be detected by XRD in the bulk soil, peds (a fractured surface and not just the cutan) cling strongly to the wetted tongue, and methyl orange turns from orange to purple-pink over most of a fragmented surface. The term can be easily be applied as a adjective to other hardpans where sepiolite is significant but not necessarily cementing, such as ‘sepiolitic’ petrocalcic/petroduric. If the horizon is in addition to the above criteria cemented to such a degree that it will slake neither in acid (so cannot be classified as petrocalcic) nor in alkali (and so cannot be classified as petroduric) then the term ‘petrosepiolitic’ would be appropriate. The ‘sepiolitic’ criteria distinguish the ‘petrosepiolitic’ horizon from a ‘silcrete’, a silica-cemented horizon which does not fit the definition of petroduric. Sepiolite is more prominent than palygorskite in the XRD traces. The HCO− 3 initially, which results in an increasing Mg trend with evaporation during the precipitation of sepiolite according to the Hardie-Eugster scheme. The result is that after sepiolite precipitation is initiated by a geochemical pH-barrier, Mg levels will rise causing the increasing (Mg+Si) /Al ratio to continue to favour sepiolite precipitation. This suggests that once sepiolite has begun to precipitate, the subsequent salinity with its accompanying Mg increase makes substantial palygorskite formation unlikely to follow. The hardpan horizons in heuweltjies commonly grade from a ‘sepiolitic’ petrocalcic in the centre through ‘sepiolitic’/‘petrosepiolitic’ to the petroduric horizon on the edges. Noteworthy sepiolite-related pedofeatures in the calcrete include ‘ooids’ with successive sepiolite (hydrophilic and therefore a precipitational substrate) and micrite/acicular calcite layers in the coatings; and limpid yellow nodules with pseudo-negative uniaxial interference figures. They superficially resemble the spherulites in the fresh termite frass. Their fibrous nature and low birefringence, together with the low Ca, high Mg, Si composition, and molar Mg/Si ratios consistent with sepiolite. The pedogenesis of the hardpans in the heuweltjie is proposed to be as follows: enrichment of cations such as Ca and Mg in the heuweltjie centre caused by termite foraging results in calcite and clay authigenesis in the centre of the heuweltjie, leaving the precipitation of pure silica to occur on the periphery. The decaying organic matter concentrated in the centre of the mound by the termites is sufficient to supply the components for calcite precipitation in the centre of the heuweltjie. Following calcite precipitation, the pH is suitable for sepiolite precipitation. The movement of the Mg-Si enriched water downslope, coupled with the decrease in HCO− 3 and increase in Mg 2 + due to sepiolite precipitation, allows for the precipitation of the ‘sepiolitic’ zone on the outer side of the calcrete, and extend beyond the calcrete in some heuweltjies. The Namaqualand coastal plain is well positioned for further work on its regolith, particularly because of the mining excavations which provide excellent exposures of well-defined layers of the regolith down to bedrock. Soil formation and termite activity is at least as old as the Last Interglacial, and so more detailed work would further the understanding of the subaerial alteration history in southern Africa, as well as providing better-constrained information on the Namaqualand soils that can be used by land-use management and biosphere studies...|$|E

Geologicamente a área é dominada por rochas granulíticas e está submetida a um clima com características equatoriais, traduzidas por pluviosidade, temperatura e umidade do ar elevadas. O relevo é representado por dois domínios: o dos Planaltos Cristalinos (Serras e Maciços Pré-Litorâneos e Tabuleiros Pré-Litorâneos) onde o relevo é mais movimentado, e a Depressão de Itabuna, com cotas mais baixas. Para desenvolvimento do trabalho foram coletados 6 perfis de solo, correspondendo a 3 Latossolos, 2 Podzólicos e 1 Cambissolo, além de amostras avulsas. O clima atuante na área propicia uma alteração eficaz, levando à formação de minerais da família da caolinita (caolinita mal cristalizada e haloisita (7 AÁNGSTROM) ́) acompanhados por hidróxidos de ferro e alumínio (goethita e gibbsita respectivamente); quantidades variáveis de esmectitas, micas alteradas e cloritas ocorrem compondo a fração argila dos horizontes de alteração e solum, representando condições particulares do meio. No que se refere a organização pedológica, pode-se distinguir diferentes níveis, de acordo com as classes de solo. Nos latossolos, tem-se o desenvolvimento de um mecanismo de agregação, que é traduzido por diferentes etapas: plasma heterogêneo ŚETAínteração argila-hidróxidos ŚETAṕlasma homogêneo ŚETAśeparações plásmicas ŚETAáumento da porosidade ŚETAíndividualização de peds. Na classe dos Podzólicos, o grau de homogeneidade do plasma é baixo; a rede de vazios é decorrente de esforços de contração e dilatação pela variação da umidade, o que leva a formação de uma estrutura grosseira com médio grau de desenvolvimento. Os Cambissolos são originados sobretudo, de 2 materiais: um deles, o mais superficial, representado por material remanejado, que dá ao solo um aspecto latossólico e organização pedológica incipiente; o segundo material, é representado pelo produto de rochas alteradas in situ e é comparável aos horizontes C de Latossolos e Podzólicos, apresentando plasma <b>apedal</b> com aspecto heterogêneo. Num contexto geral, os Latossolos ocupam preferencialmente os Tabuleiros Pré-Litorâneos. Esta unidade geomorfológica está recoberta por material coluvial, do Neógeno, daí a existência de solos profundos, bem desenvolvidos, com baixo grau de saturação em bases, pH ácido e mineralogia representada por caolinita, hidróxidos de ferro e alumínio, e quartzo. Os solos mais jovens, Podzólicos e Cambissolos, ocupam, grosso modo, as unidades geomorfológicas das Serras e Maciços Pré-Litorâneos e a Depressão de Itabuna. As retiradas das alteritas aí existentes, no Plio-Plestoceno, permitiu a formação de perfis a partir da rocha, com pouco e médio grau de desenvolvimento, apresentando caráter eutrófico, acidez moderada e paragênese secundária mais diversificada - caso dos Podzólicos; os Cambissolos, por sofrerem influência do material transportado, apresentam complexo com baixo grau de saturação e acidez forte, apesar da presença de minerais alteráveis na massa do solo. In {{order to}} study the alteration and pedogenesis under humid tropical climate, an area was selected within the Cacueira Region of Bahia, displaying petrographic homogeneity. Geologically, the area is dominated by granulitic rocks and is subjected to a climate with equatorial characteristics, worked out by monsoon rains, temperature and high humidity of air. The relief is represented by two domains: of the Crystalline Highlands (Pré-Littoral Serras and Massifs and Pre-Littoral Table Lands), where the relief is more accentuated, and the Depression of Itabuna, with lower topographic levels. For development of the work, six profiles of soil were studied, corresponding to Latosoil (03). Podzolic Soil (02) and one of Cambisoil, besides the individual samples. The acting climate of the region propogated an effective alteration, leading {{to the formation of}} minerals of kaolin family (kaolinite - porly crystallized and haloisite (7 AÁNGSTROM) ́) accompanied by hidroxides of iron and aluminium (goethite and gibbsite respectively); varying quantities of smectites, altered micas and chlorites occur, constituting the fraction of clays of horizontes of alteration and solum, representing particular conditions of environment. With reference to the pedologic organization, one may distinguish different levels, according to the classes of sols. In the Latosoil, there is development of a mechanism off aggregation, that is brought out during different stages, heterogeneous plasma ŚETAćlay-hidroxide interaction ŚETAh́omogeneous plasma plasmic separations ŚETAíncrease of porosity ŚETAïndividualization of peds. In the class of Podzolic Soils, the homogeneity of plasma is low, the network of blank spaces is the result of forces of contraction and dilatation by variation in humidity, that leads to the formation of a coarse structure with medium grade of development. The Cambisols are originated overall of two materials; one of them is more surfacial represented by reworked material, that gives to the soil an aspect of Latosoil and the incipient pedologic organization; the other material is represented by the product of altered rocks ïn situänd is comparable with C-horizon of Latosoil and Podzolic Soil, giving the basal plasma an heterogeneous aspect. In a general context, the Latosoil preferentially occupy the Pre-Littoral Tablelands, this geomorphological unit is covered by colluvial material of Neogene age, there is existence of deep soils, well developed, of low grade in bases saturation, acidic pH and a mineralogical assemblage formed of caolinite, aluminium and iron hidroxides and quartz. The young soils, that are Podzolic Soils and Camsoils broadly occupy the geomorphological unities defined as Pre-Littoral Serras and Massifs, and the Depression of Itabuna. The depart of the alterites from these sites, during the Plio-Pleistocene, permited the formation of profiles of these young soils from the rocks, with low to medium grade of development; the Podzolic Soils show eutrophic character, moderate acidity and a more diversified secondary mineral paragenesis; the Cambisoils, that were submitted to the influence of the transported material, bear a higher acidity and low grade in bases saturation complexe, in spite of the presence of altered minerals in the mass of soil...|$|E
