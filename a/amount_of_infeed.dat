To capture {{the influence of}} fluctuations in operational planning, we model the forecast errors of the uncertain in-feeds as random variables and formulate a security constrained optimal power flow using chance constraints. The chance constraints limit the probability of violations of technical constraints, such as generation and transmission limits, but require a tractable reformulation. In this paper, we discuss different analytical reformulations of the chance constraints, based on a given set of assumptions concerning the forecast error distributions. In particular, we discuss reformulations that do not assume a normal distribution, and admit an analytical reformulation given only a mean vector and covariance matrix. We illustrate our method with {{a case study of}} the IEEE 118 bus system, based on real data from the European system. The different reformulations are compared in terms of both achieved empirical violation probability and operational cost, which allows us to provide a suggestion for the most appropriate reformulation in an optimal power flow setting. For a large number of uncertainty sources, it is observed that the distributions of the line flows and generator outputs can be close to normal, even though the power injections are not normally distributed...|$|R

30|$|The operational-control {{criteria}} used for system frequency analysis {{is a specific}} criteria which is mainly a personal version of the GB Security and Quality of Supply Standards (GB SQSS) [17]. The following assumptions are used: ① the level of infrequency loss <b>of</b> power <b>infeed</b> is set up to 1800 GW, and frequency response must avoid a deviation of the system frequency outside statutory limit: which range 49.8 – 50.2  Hz for more than 5 cycles, ② the level of normal loss <b>of</b> power <b>infeed</b> is set up to 1.35 GW for frequency response to avoid a deviation in the system frequency by more than 0.20  Hz, ③ the system frequency can rise to 52.0  Hz or fall to 47.0  Hz in exceptional circumstances. If system frequency is over 52.0  Hz, over-frequency relays will trip generators, ④ frequency control devices (or a speed governor) are set up to operate with an overall speed Droop of 4 % (GB SQSS establishes between 3 % and 5 %). In this paper, UFLS is set to start at 49.8  Hz and the plan consists of six load shedding steps of unequal size with the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> load shedding of 0.25 p.u [23].

40|$|With the {{increasing}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> volatile <b>infeed</b> from {{renewable energy sources}} the need for flexibility {{becomes more and more}} urgent. This holds especially for the distribution grids where critical load situations caused by high local renewable infeed occur increasingly often. Therefore, demand side management with broad participation of households has been proposed as one cornerstone for a future sustainable energy system. Local prices may contribute substantially to enable a smart behaviour of grid users by providing appropriate incentives. Although the benefits of both demand side management and local prices seem evident in theory practicalities have to be considered when it comes to assessing their effectiveness. Notably individual restrictions for different kinds of grid users have to be regarded in detail. Eventually, the potential contribution of local pricing to a secure and efficient energy system may be called into question. In this paper, a typical rural low voltage grid is analysed having local electricity generation from PV systems and typical household consumption. In addition, a high penetration of heat pumps is supposed as well as the implementation of a framework of local prices. With households heated by electric heat pumps a potentially flexible consumer type is implemented in detail. Thus, a model of a possible future rural low voltage system is implemented and used to assess the limitations of local pricing mechanisms 22 ̆ 0 ac' firstly, by a sequential deduction of the possibly leveraged potential of the local market mechanism under existing technical constraints and, secondly, by a scenario analysis of the allocation of economic benefits. Results show that even with given local incentives the consumption adjustment towards an efficient grid usage cannot be realized frequently as comfort and system needs have priority. I. e. due to limited complementarity of heat pump consumption and photovoltaic infeed patterns expected operational system cost reduction is low 22 ̆ 0 ac' especially in comparison to required investments in smart systems. Hence, the example disproves any generalized claims about the efficiency of local pricing - yet obviously it does not prove that local pricing is of no worth in general. As second main result, stylized policy choices are analysed. Thus, it is demonstrated how the benefits of local pricing mechanisms can be distributed to the market participants and which are the difficulties that policy makers will have to face. Ultimately, for the present case study, {{it is not possible to}} set sufficient investment incentives for the installation of flexibility measures for heat pumps without either causing disadvantages to renewables-based electricity generators or without receiving additional regulatory payments from the overarching system. Thereby, the paper contributes to the existing literature by analysing a novel pricing mechanism and, more importantly, demonstrating the effects of these pricing mechanisms on the system costs and the economic figures of the market participants. As main result, it can be seen that practicalities play an important role and must be taken into account when considering the implementation of local pricing mechanisms. Furthermore, policy makers have to pay attention to the redistributive effects as they might be substantial even though the costs savings of the overall system will not necessarily be meaningful...|$|R

40|$|First online: 07 March 2015 The {{dominating}} view in {{the literature}} is that renewable electricity production increases the price variance on spot markets for electricity.

40|$|In future {{power systems}} reduced overall inertia {{caused by an}} {{increased}} dominance of asynchronous generation and interconnections would make frequency control particularly challenging. As the number and power rating of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC systems increases, network service provision would be expected from such systems {{and to do so}} would require overload capacity {{to be included in the}} converter specifications. This paper studies the provision of frequency services from Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) -based VSC HVDC interconnections using temperature-constrained overload capability. Overload of the MMC-based HVDC system is achieved through controlled circulating currents, at the expense of higher losses, and subject to a control scheme which dynamically limits the overload available in order to keep the semiconductor junction temperatures within operational limits. Two frequency control schemes that use the obtained overload capacity to provide frequency response during emergency conditions are investigated. The controllers’ performance is demonstrated in the context of the future Great Britain transmission grid through a reduced equivalent test system.
