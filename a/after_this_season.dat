5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three {{weeks of the season}} owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total at the time and worth around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the {{remainder}} of the season, Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings, although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties. He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled. In 20 first-class matches, Bosanquet scored 1,198 runs (average 37.43) and took 63 wickets (average 27.77). <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905, particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow. In another eight seasons of first-class cricket, he took only 22 wickets. However, his batting seemed to improve in this time.|$|E

25|$|Whittle was {{not able}} to sustain this bowling form into 1905.

25|$|In 1924 {{the club}} {{changed its name}} from Cercle Sportif Brugeois to Royal Cercle Sportif Brugeois. The club {{embarked}} on a successful period, led by two key players: Belgian record international Florimond Vanhalme and player-coach Louis Saeys. Cercle led the league midway through the 1925–26 season, but player injuries led to poor results that saw them finish in fifth place. Several important players left Cercle <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> leaving hopes low for the 1926–27 campaign, but the year saw Cercle achieve their second national championship on the penultimate matchday with a thrilling 5–6 win over Daring Bruxelles. The victory was overshadowed by two deaths at the club a few months earlier: Albert Van Coile, who had succumbed from injuries sustained in a match against US Tourcoing, and former chairman René de Peellaert, who died from pneumonia which he had caught during Van Coile's funeral.|$|E

Nebraska, who leads the all-time series 86–17–2, avenged last year's 7–9 loss, which was Iowa State's first win in Lincoln in 34 years. Nebraska and Iowa State traded scores in the 4th quarter before Nebraska led 31–24 in the final minutes. Iowa State scored a touchdown to make the score 31–30 Nebraska leading. ISU Head Coach Paul Rhoads called a 2-point conversion.

25|$|Babel {{began his}} career at Ajax in 1998, working his way up through the youth team and into the senior squad. He played three seasons for the first team before he was {{transferred}} to Liverpool in mid-2007, where under three successive managers he failed to secure a regular first team position. Babel was sold to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim in January 2011, for a sum around half of that which Liverpool paid for him. His time at Hoffenheim was marred with disciplinary problems with three managers at the club. In the summer of 2012, Babel bought out the remaining final year of his contract, making him a free agent, and re-signed a one-year contract with Ajax. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> Babel went on to sign with Kasımpaşa on 21 June 2013. Babel often was linked to {{a return to the}} Premier League during his time in Turkey, before ending rumours by signing for UAE side Al Ain FC in July 2015.|$|E

This was also the third consecutive season a male contestant had won, the longest streak for either gender. It was the first season since sixth season where a female made it to the finale and was also the first time since season seven that both the finalists released a different song as a debut single.|$|E
25|$|Between 1900 and 1902, Yorkshire {{lost only}} {{twice in the}} County Championship, both times to Somerset. In 1900, the team won the Championship without losing to another county, and Rhodes and Haigh {{dominated}} the bowling; only two teams scored more than 300 against them. The following season, Rhodes and Hirst were the successful bowlers as injury curtailed Haigh's season. In effect, only 13 players appeared for Yorkshire as the Championship was retained. However, the match against Somerset at Headingley provided a surprise. The visitors had scored just 87 and Yorkshire established a big lead {{with a total of}} 325. But Somerset scored 630 in the second innings and dismissed the County Champions for 111, winning by 279 runs. In contrast, Nottinghamshire were bowled out for only 13 runs a month later. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> important batsman Frank Mitchell departed to live in South Africa, but Jackson, who had been fighting in the Boer War since 1900, returned. Yorkshire won their third successive Championship in 1902 as Haigh and Rhodes resumed their successful pairing; in May and June, no opposing batting line-up managed to score 130 for 13 successive innings. However, Somerset again defeated Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Flintoff {{came out}} of {{retirement}} in May 2014, returning to Lancashire to play Twenty20 only. He featured in {{the final of the}} competition, dismissing Ian Bell with the ball and hitting two sixes in the penultimate over as Lancashire fell just short against Birmingham Bears. <b>After</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> he was signed by the Brisbane Heat in the Australian Big Bash League for the 2014–15 season. Flintoff disappointed on the field, ending the season with a high score of 46, with only one other score in double figures (15), along with three wickets at an average of 45.33. His real worth was in his persona {{both on and off the}} field. He had an on-field microphone for most matches and memorably sang In the Ghetto by Elvis Presley during one game while on air. He also began commentating matches for Network Ten. These experiences endeared him to Australian crowds, a far cry from his England days. After the 2014-15 Big Bash League season, he finally retired from cricket. He returned to Australia for the 2015-16 Big Bash League season as a commentator for Network Ten.|$|E
25|$|Following Britain's {{entry into}} the First World War on 4 August 1914, Rippon was {{commissioned}} into the horse transport section of the Army Service Corps as a second lieutenant. He was badly wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign, which he had joined on 5 November 1915. As {{a result of his}} wounds he was discharged with the Silver War Badge and the honorary rank of lieutenant. On 10 October 1918 he managed to obtain a new commission as a second lieutenant in the Administrative Branch of the fledgling Royal Air Force and was based in Edmonton, London. Despite his wartime injuries, he appeared fairly regularly for Somerset again in 1919. Against Essex at Leyton, he and Sydney put on 144 for the first Somerset wicket, and Dudley went on to score 134, his highest first-class score. But <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>season,</b> he made just one further first-class appearance, in the 1920 season, his wounds finally taking their toll. His brother continued to play occasional matches for Somerset through to 1937. After his retirement from first-class cricket, Rippon became cricket correspondent for the Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News and Daily Chronicle.|$|E

Despite that, BC Šiauliai were eliminated in the LKL quarter-final again by the future finalist Neptūnas Klaipėda. Travis Leslie joined Lietuvos rytas Vilnius <b>after</b> <b>this</b> <b>season</b> and won the LKL Slam Dunk Contest again by dunking over Mercedes-Benz and Grigorij Khizhnyak. BC Šiauliai retained their BBL title by defeating BK Ventspils in the finals 2–0 during the following season. Second game, which was won 88–80, required OT. Gintaras Leonavičius was named MVP of the tournament. BC Šiauliai also recovered their LKF Cup bronze title that season. However, the 2014–15 LKL season playoffs ended early for them, after being eliminated in the quarter-final for the third straight season, this time – by Lietuvos rytas Vilnius 3–0. Following the end of the season, two BC Šiauliai players: Rokas Giedraitis and Julius Jucikas joined Rytas.|$|E
