40|$|The results {{obtained}} from operational tests in a {{refuse incineration plant}} for municipal and industrial wastes serve to describe activated lignite's efficiency as a mass sorbent for dioxin reduction in the filter-bed process, with use being made of the existing infrastructure. Variations in the dosing rate, on the one hand, {{and the use of}} different grain sizes, on the other hand, identify the selection criteria for the determination of the process-engineering optimum for waste gas cleaning, with sorbent injection being integrated into the existing facility of quasi-dry waste gas cleaning.

Mechanical activation of fly ash {{has been carried}} out using laboratory ball mill. To determine the structural changes in both, the fly ash and the resulted geopolymer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements were performed. Isothermal conduction calorimetry method was applied to study the geopolymerisation reactions in mechanically non-activated (raw) and activated fly ash samples. The isothermal conduction calorimetry results showed similar peak intensity for mechanically activated (530 min) fly ash samples. However, the intensity of peak for 120 min milled brown coal fly ash was the highest. The compressive strength of the specimen was found to be dependent on the grinding residence time as well as composition/type of fly ash...|$|E
40|$|Blocking of the {{collection}} hoppers of the baghouse filters in a fluidized bed incinerator for co-incineration of high calorific industrial solid waste and sludge was observed. The composition of the flue gas cleaning residue (FGCR), both from a blocked hopper and from a normal hopper, was investigated by (differential) thermogravimetric analysis, quantitative X-ray powder diffraction and wet chemical analysis. The lower elemental carbon concentration and the higher calcium carbonate concentration of the agglomerated sample {{was the result of}} oxidation of carbon and subsequent reaction of CO 2 with CaO. The evolved heat causes a temperature increase, with the decomposition of CaOHCl as a consequence. The formation of calcite and calcium chloride and the evolution of heat caused agglomeration of the FGCR. <b>Activated</b> <b>lignite</b> coke was replaced by another adsorption agent with less carbon, so the auto-ignition temperature increased; since then no further block formation has occurred. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Lignite</b> <b>activated</b> carbon was {{provided}} through lignite which is treated specially. The adsorption capacity and mechanism of COD from Coal gasification wastewater by <b>lignite</b> <b>activated</b> carbon have been studied．The adsorption capacities of <b>lignite</b> <b>activated</b> carbon {{at different times}} were obtained by concentration of COD in the remainder solution. Three simplified kinetic models: pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion equations were adopted to examine the mechanism of the adsorption process. The {{results showed that the}} adsorption can be expressed by the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption balance capacity was obtained as 50. 8 mg·g- 1 (298 K), and the adsorption balance capacity decreased with increasing of temperature, which showed that the adsorption process was exothermic. The adsorption activation energy (Ea) was calculated as 5. 76 kJ·mol- 1, and it showed that the adsorption process was Physical adsorption. This study explored new treatment channels for lignite comprehensive utilization. ...|$|R

A few studies have explored the effects of mixture with water and adsorption to soil on carbon isotope fractionation (Harrington et al. 1999; Slater et al. 1999; Höhener et al. 2003; Schüth et al. 2003; Bouchard et al. 2008 a, b). No significant carbon isotope fractionation was observed during the equilibrium vaporization of aqueous solution of toluene and trichloroethylene (Slater et al. 1999), the soil adsorption of BTEX (Harrington et al. 1999) and the sorption of halogenated hydrocarbon compounds (trichloroethene, cis-dichloroethene, vinylchloride) and BTEX compounds onto <b>activated</b> carbon, <b>lignite</b> coke, and lignite (Schüth et al. 2003). However, significant fractionation has been observed after passing some volatile organic compounds across alluvial sand (e.g., ∆ 13 Cvapor–liquid is − 2.14  ±  0.22 ‰, − 1.73  ±  0.52 ‰, and − 1.55  ±  0.45 ‰ for n-pentane, n-hexane, and benzene, respectively) (Bouchard et al. 2008 b), and an unsaturated soil zone (Bouchard et al. 2008 a). Therefore, the matrix effects (of both mixing and soil diffusion) on the evaporation fractionation should be better understood prior to utilizing the δ 13 C value of volatile organic compounds.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{investigations}} {{made during}} the last few years have substantially extended the knowledge of environmental pollutants and their impact on Nature and Man. This knowledge and the growing environmental awareness of the population have caused environmental requirements to be constantly tightened and legislation introduced to prescribe lower emission limits. It is in particular the emissions of toxic organic compounds such as polychlorinated dioxins and furans as well as heavy metals which have been gaining importance in the industrial countries worldwide due to the increasing amounts of residues being incinerated and the application of recycling processes. Since primary measures alone do not permit sufficient reduction in emissions, additional cleaning systems have to be installed. In this context, process solutions are being sought which allow the gases to be cleaned in a technically efficient and inexpensive way. A cleaning measure covering all emission-relevant pollutants is adsorption using carbon-containing adsorbents such as <b>activated</b> <b>lignite</b> or activated carbon which are comparatively easy to integrate into dedusting, scrubbing and absorption processes. By contrast with adsorption in separate waste gas cleaning processes, which has been common practice to date, and thanks to extensiv...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of lignite-char-supported metal oxide catalyst for reduction of nitric oxide (NO) is investigated in this paper. The characteristics of NO reduction by copper and iron oxide catalysts supported on <b>activated</b> <b>lignite</b> chars (ALC) was studied using a fixed-bed reactor at 300 °C. The {{results showed that}} the impregnation of Cu on ALC resulted in higher catalytic reactivity during NO reduction compared with that of Fe. Chemisorption of O₂ and NO on Cu/ALC catalyst was found {{to play an important role}} in denitrification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses showed that chemically adsorbed oxygen facilitates the formation of C(O) complex and oxidation of Cu⁰ to Cu⁺ for Cu/ALC catalyst. The C(O) intermediates and C* production formed due to the fact that C/O₂ reaction promoted the reduction of NO. It is suggested that the catalytic reaction of NO in this case comprised of C/O₂ reaction, C(O) /NO reaction and formation of N₂ and CO₂. Cu seemed to have significantly promoted the C(O) formation and CO oxidation compared with Fe. The catalytic reactivity of Cu species for C(O) formation and CO oxidation followed the order of Cu⁰ > Cu⁺ > Cu²⁺. Fe₃O₄ was believed to be the active phase in Fe catalyst. The oxygen and char-supported metal catalysts significantly promoted C/NO reaction, and therefore may lead to a lower operation temperature of NOₓ removal...|$|E
40|$|For the {{development}} of decentralized treatment systems for road runoff, the determination of pollutant removal capacities is essential. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the impact of boundary conditions on the simultaneous removal of copper, nickel, and zinc by six sorbents used for urban stormwater treatment (i. e., granular activated alumina, anthracite, granular reactivated carbon, granular ferric hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and granular <b>activated</b> <b>lignite).</b> For batch experiments, capacities were determined at initial concentrations within the range of 2. 5 – 180 mg/L with a rotary shaker. Further influences were investigated: the use of a horizontal shaker for concentrations of up to 1080 mg/L, a variation of the initial pH value (5 and 7), and the presence of a buffer. Furthermore, the influences of the filtration process on the capacities were studied. Kinetic experiments were conducted for contact times between 5 min and 120 min. Lab-scale column experiments with inflow concentrations of 2. 5 mg/L (copper and nickel) and 5. 0  mg/L (zinc) at an initial pH of 5 and a contact time of 11 min were performed for comparison. Selected experiments were subsequently carried out with changes in initial concentrations and contact time. One result is that it is essential to conduct batch experiments with the metals of interest. The capacities determined by column experiments deviated from batch experiments. Batch experiments under well-defined conditions can be used to evaluate different production batches. Column experiments give a more faithful capacity by considering realistic boundary conditions and should be preferred to determine efficiencies and service lives...|$|E

40|$|Under certain {{operating}} conditions, polychlorinated {{dioxins and furans}} {{occur in}} the flue gases of thermal processing plants. Current EU Directives limit the concentration of these emissions to less than 0. 1 ng toxicity equivalents (TEQ) per standard cubic metre of dry gas at 11 vol% O- 2. These Directives {{have been included in}} the emission regulations of most of the EU countries. Dioxins and furans are not particular to incinerators; they can also originate from metallurgical and other thermal processes when these are operated under unfavourable conditions. Adsorption methods employing non-flammable carbonaceous adsorbents (<b>activated</b> carbon, <b>lignite)</b> are particularly well suited for removing PCDD/Fs. For adsorption, which requires the sorbent to be brought in contact with the gas to be cleaned, various processes are currently available, ie classical adsorption in moving/fixed bed filters or the technique of adsorption in an entrained dust cloud with a downstream fabric filter or electrostatic precipitator to remove the spent sorbent from the waste gas (entrained process). The paper will firstly assess both adsorption concepts; it will then use results obtained from operational tests in incineration plants for municipal and industrial waste to describe the efficiency of the dioxin-sorption in an entrained bed (pneumatic transport of pulverized adsorbent) and a fixed/moving bed (granular adsorbent). Variations in the dosing rate and the use of different adsorbents, as well as the operating temperature, identify the selection criteria for determining the process-engineering optimum for flue gas cleaning. The paper will demonstrate that the PCDDIF emissions can be reduced to below 0. 1 ng TEQ Nm(- 3) and will identify the operating conditions required to achieve this standard.

40|$|Many {{pharmaceuticals}} {{have attracted}} the attention of environmental scientists and are of concern due to their observed occurrence in surface water, ground water, drinking water, sediment, and soil. Further investigations have considered their removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment processes and their ecotoxicological effects. Cytostatics are a class of pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of cancer and have the potential to negatively impact the environment. It is hypothesized that due to their mode of action, practically all eukaryotic organisms are vulnerable to damage, with teratogenicity being the greatest concern at low ng/L levels. This thesis will discuss the contributions to this field in the form of 1) development of a method for chemical analysis of cytostatics in wastewater, 2) occurrence studies, and 3) potential for removal with advanced treatment processes. To expand the knowledge on the environmental occurrence of cytostatics and to compliment a range of cytostatics for which occurrence data are available, a solid phase extraction and HPLC-MS/MS method was established for highly consumed cytostatics 5 fluorouracil, cytarabine, and gemcitabine and the human metabolites uracil 1 -beta-d-arabinofuranoside and 2 ’, 2 ’-difluorodeoxyuridine. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), a chromatography for polar analytes in aqueous samples, was used to achieve a good retention of the polar analytes. Along with the method development, retention mechanisms on the HILIC stationary phase were studied. Both partitioning and adsorption {{play a role in the}} retention on the tested sulfoalkylbetaine modified silica HILIC column material. The contribution of these two processes changes over the 1. 6 - 40 % range of water in the mobile phase. Although the specific break point is difficult to determine, adsorption becomes more significant as the fraction of water in the mobile phase decreases below approximately 16 %. Wastewater from a Swiss hospital was monitored for 5 -fluorouracil, gemcitabine and 2 ’, 2 ’-difluorodeoxyuridine (metabolite of gemcitabine). The limits of quantification were 5. 0, 0. 9, and 9. 0 ng/L and the maximum concentrations detected were 27, 38, and 840 ng/L, respectively. Emission levels within one day and over several days were found to correlate with the pharmacokinetic excretion pattern and the consumed amounts in the hospital during these days. On average, 1. 1 %, 1. 4 % and 3. 7 % of the total excreted amounts of the cytostatics 5 fluorouracil, gemcitabine and 2 ', 2 '-difluorodeoxyuridine were found in the hospital wastewater, respectively. Due to low recoveries, stability studies were performed and showed that the half-lives of the analytes in the raw wastewater are very short: 1. 0, 0. 7 and 2. 5 hours, respectively. Environmental impact of 5 -fluorouracil, gemcitabine and 2 ’, 2 ’ difluorodeoxy-uridine seem to be of minor importance, as the environmental risk assessment quotients PEC/PNEC are protective (in orders of magnitude of 10 e- 3 - 10 e- 6). Nevertheless, cytostatics are a special group of pharmaceuticals with carcinogenic potency and until data with specific tests and end-points designed especially for this class of pharmaceuticals are available, the precautionary principle should be applied. To study removal possibilities, sorption to powdered activated carbon was investigated. Adsorption is an effective process for the removal of hydrophobic substances from water. Employing it as a wastewater treatment process, polar compounds may also be simultaneously removed to a certain extent. Laboratory scale batch experiments were performed to evaluate the adsorption kinetics and isotherm data of 5 -fluorouracil and cytarabine on two powdered activated carbons, Norit SAE Super and <b>Activated</b> <b>Lignite</b> HOK Super. The results of the adsorption characterization were compared with those of two hydrophobic substances, bisphenol A and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol, produced with the identical experimental conditions and matrix. A dose of 30 mg. L- 1 of Norit SAE Super that resulted in removal of the two hydrophobic control compounds below 1 % was found to remove 30 and 65 % of 5 -fluorouracil and cytarabine, respectively. Influence of the solution pH, ionic strength, temperature, and presence of matrix compounds competing for the sorption sites was studied on one of the tested powdered activated carbons, showing that the extent of the competing compounds’ influence is the greatest. Applying a pseudo single-solute isotherm and a concept directly linking carbon dose with relative removal of the micropollutant, capacity of the powdered activated carbon was successfully predicted for different initial micropollutant concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{mushroom}} (Agaricus bisporus) has {{a requirement}} for a ‘‘casing layer’’ that has specific physical, chemical and microbiological properties which stimulate and promote the initiation of primordia. Some of these primordia then may develop further into sporophores, involving differentiation of tissue.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate alternative landfill liner materials that could be utilized in conjunction with current liners in order to improve the liner's performance by preventing the release of hazardous chemicals into the subsurface environment. Five alternative liner materials were tested in this study: granular <b>activated</b> carbon, <b>lignite,</b> compost, peat moss, and powdered activated carbon produced from cotton gin trash. Three volatile organic compounds are used in this study: Benzene, Toluene, and O-Xylene. The linear Langmuir isotherm coefficients, Qo, and b, and the linear adsorption distribution coefficient K,,.,, were determined by equilibrium studies for each chemical and material. The retardation factor, R., was calculated from the breakthrough curve data for each combination of chemical and material. The cotton gin trash dissolved in the presence of each of the solvents so no data is presented for this material. Because activated carbon sorbed all of the chemical during the isotherm testing, no data could be collected for the extraction procedure. Lignite has the highest adsorption capacity of the three remaining materials and the second highest retardation factor. Activated carbon has the highest retardation factor of each of the chemicals, as expected. The results show that the adsorption capacity and the retardation factor are more dependent on surface area and pore diameter than on the organic carbon content of the test materials. Lignite is the leading candidate after this study to be used as an additive material in liner design. However, further evaluation of these liner materials must be accomplished in order to determine which material, if any, could be added to the design of landfill liners to aid in preventing the release of hazardous chemicals into the subsurface environment and groundwater supply...|$|R

Flue gases from {{waste incineration}} plants typically contain pollutants such as polychlorinated dioxins, furans (PCDD/PCDF), and mercury {{in the form of}} Hg"o and Hg" 2 "+. The direct injection of carbon into the gas stream (carbon entrainment process) is increasingly being used for the reduction of residual emissions. Tests were performed with a catalytic converter and sorption facility (KASO) on a pilot plant scale using <b>activated</b> carbon or <b>lignite</b> carbon (HOK) mixed with burned lime (CaO). Investigations into volatile pollutant behavior were carried out in this air cleaning system to accomplish the following objectives: - Whether adsorption takes place on the sorbent in the flow phase or in bag filters, - the effects of sorbent residence time in the gas flow and of burned lime on sorption, and - the effects of HOK concentration in the gas flow on the sorption. Chlorobenzene (5 mgC/std. m" 3) was used as a model compound for halogenated organic hydrocarbons such as PCDD and PCDF. The experimental results showed that - sorption mainly takes place at the separated sorbent on the filter hoses; - irrespective of the residence time (4. 5 - 18 s), the 10 % HOK/CaO mixture with sorption rates of 54 % led to better results than the 4 %, 20 % and 30 % mixtures at constant HOK raw gas concentrations; - an optimum sorption rate of 54 % was obtained for the 10 % sorbent at a HOK raw gas concentration of 100 mg/std. m" 3.
