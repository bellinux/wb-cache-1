5000|$|Newer [...] "{{multi-service}} SONET/SDH" [...] (also {{known as}} a multi-service provisioning platform or MSPP) equipment has all the capabilities of legacy ADMs, but can also include cross-connect functionality to manage multiple fiber rings in <b>a</b> single <b>chassis.</b> These <b>devices</b> can replace multiple legacy ADMs and also allow connections directly from Ethernet LANs to a service provider's optical backbone. In the end of 2003, sales of multiservice ADMs exceeded those of legacy ADMs for the first time, as the change to next-generation SONET/SDH networks accelerated.|$|R
40|$|A modular robotic vehicle {{includes}} <b>a</b> <b>chassis,</b> {{driver input}} <b>devices,</b> <b>an</b> {{energy storage system}} (ESS), a power electronics module (PEM), modular electronic assemblies (eModules) connected to the ESS via the PEM, one or more master controllers, and various embedded controllers. Each eModule includes a drive wheel containing a propulsion-braking module, and a housing containing propulsion and braking control assemblies with respective embedded propulsion and brake controllers, and a mounting bracket covering a steering control assembly with embedded steering controllers. The master controller, which is in communication with each eModule and with the driver input devices, communicates with and independently controls each eModule, by-wire, via the embedded controllers to establish a desired operating mode. Modes may include a two-wheel, four-wheel, diamond, and omni-directional steering modes {{as well as a}} park mode. A bumper may enable docking with another vehicle, with shared control over the eModules of the vehicles...|$|R
40|$|During {{design process}} of {{electronic}} <b>device</b> <b>chassis,</b> dynamic analysis plays {{a very important}} role in improving its environment adaptability. After analyzing characteristic of <b>chassis,</b> <b>a</b> finite element model is established and employed. The analysis model and its harmonic responses based on the ANSYS are presented. The reasonable of the finite element model is verified by the experiment results of sweep frequency excitation vibration to typical electronic <b>device</b> <b>chassis</b> used in nuclear power station. Vibration modal analysis shows the weakest location of the chassis...|$|R
