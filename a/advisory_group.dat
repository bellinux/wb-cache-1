5|$|Diem {{appointed}} Bui Van Luong—a {{family friend}} and devout Catholic—as {{the head of}} COMIGAL, the government resettlement agency. COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group.</b> Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months in the job, Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E

5|$|In {{northern}} Taiwan, Billie caused widespread flash flooding, displacing {{thousands of}} people and resulting in extensive damage. Approximately one-third of Taipei was inundated by floodwaters, and hospital patients were forced to evacuate to Okinawa after a Military Assistance <b>Advisory</b> <b>Group</b> compound was impacted by the heavy rains. Over 10,000people were rendered homeless in Taipei alone after the city's shanty-type dwellings along with well-built residences were destroyed. In total, the effects of Billie in Taiwan killed seven people. Extensive flooding also occurred in nearby eastern China, inundating rice fields. In {{order to avoid the}} storm, thousands of fishermen sought shelter in local harbors. Cleanup and relief operations quickly ensued following the storm's passage.|$|E

5|$|The Milford {{area study}} has been dormant since July 2007 due to {{community}} opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various options that included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes {{to the west and}} east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE1Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's <b>advisory</b> <b>group</b> of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its <b>advisory</b> <b>group,</b> the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.|$|E
