25|$|The Persian {{physician}} Abū ‘Alī al-Husayn ibn Sina ("Avicenna") described opium as {{the most}} powerful of the stupefacients, in comparison to mandrake and other highly effective herbs, in The Canon of Medicine.

It also refers to opium's potential as a poison. Avicenna describes several methods of delivery <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>for</b> doses of the drug. This classic text was translated into Latin in 1175 and later into many other languages and remained authoritative until the 19th century.

25|$|The americium-241 in {{ionizing}} {{smoke detectors}} poses a potential environmental hazard, albeit {{a very small}} one. Disposal regulations <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>for</b> smoke detectors vary from region to region. The amount of radioactive material contained in ionizing smoke detectors is very small and thus doesn't represent a significant radiological hazard. If the americium is left in the ionization chamber of the alarm the radiological risk is insignificant because the chamber acts as a shield to the alpha radiation. A person would have to open the sealed chamber and ingest or inhale the americium for the risk to be significant. The radiation risk of exposure to an ionic smoke detector is much smaller than natural background radiation under normal operation.|$|E

In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33 step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Headed by former Senator Joe Lieberman and former Governor Tom Ridge, the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget.

In April 1765 Blackstone began to actively seek judicial appointment. In December 1761 he asked Lord Shelburne, a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as Chief Justice of Chester, writing again in July 1762 to [...] "prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty's Notice", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the Court of Common Pleas. Parliamentary service was considered a [...] "desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges", something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and [...] "indifferent" [...] speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees {{to provide them with}} technical expertise in drafting legislation. He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of Lord Camden (a Whig) as Lord Chancellor.|$|E
