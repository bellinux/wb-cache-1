6000|$|A few stars {{had come}} out on the blue obscurity, clear as crystal, of the sky. The dry, thin voice of the Chevalier spoke harshly: [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> all this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, if he {{have more}} {{wonderful}} attributes than these," [...] said Elinor, laughing, [...] "Boston is a perilous abode {{for the poor}} gentleman. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> of a painter, or a wizard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' I said, 'and what {{particular}} {{sort of a}} prize-winner <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> {{all about}} the ribbons they gave you at the Crystal Palace, and let's get it over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I'll find it {{out from}} himself soon. By the way, what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about explosions {{yesterday}} when that little white gull came to admire your pretty face, and took off our attention?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Baron Sampsono Brasso and {{his fair}} sister <b>are</b> (<b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me)</b> at the Play?' said Mr Swiveller, leaning {{his left arm}} heavily upon the table, and raising his voice and his right leg after {{the manner of a}} {{theatrical}} bandit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I wouldn't {{tell him}} so, but I think your sister would show more power in {{converting}} a young fellow like Ussher than poor Cullen. And then, {{as to his}} riding down the poor; you know every one must do his duty, and if the boys will be acting against the laws, why, of course, they must bear the consequences. Not but that I think Captain Ussher is too hard upon them. But, Thady, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> the truth in this? Is it not that you fear the young man won't marry Feemy, rather than that he will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mellish did all right, but the rotter couldn't {{keep it to}} himself. Went {{and told}} the Old Man. The Old Man sent for me. He was as decent as {{anything}} at first. That was just his guile. He made me describe exactly where I had seen the paper, and so on. That was rather risky, of course, but I put it as vaguely as I could. When I had finished, he suddenly whipped round, and said, [...] "Bradshaw, why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> all these lies?" [...] That's {{the sort of thing}} that makes you feel rather a wreck. I was too surprised to say anything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was now {{the turn}} of Lieut. Feraud to be astonished. [...] "What the devil <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> there?" [...] he murmured, faintly, and fell into such {{profound}} wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of Lieut. D'Hubert. The two officers, one tall, with an interesting face and a moustache the colour of ripe corn, the other, short and sturdy, with a hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hair, approached the mistress {{of the house to}} take their leave. Madame de Lionne, a woman of eclectic taste, smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an equal share of interest. Madame de Lionne took her delight in the infinite variety of the human species. All the other eyes in the drawing-room followed the departing officers; and when they had gone out one or two men, who had already heard of the duel, imparted the information to the sylph-like ladies, who received it with faint shrieks of humane concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be helped--or rather I don't {{want to help}} it. I've pledged my {{word and}} honor to see this {{undertaking}} through, and I mean to redeem it if it ruins <b>me.</b> Now what <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> about Mrs. Leslie?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You! This <b>is</b> impossible. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> a {{fabricated}} lie. If you {{had gone}} away in that boat, how could <b>you</b> now <b>be</b> here? No, no--it is a miserable lie, and Rose is below!" ...|$|R

When the door had closed after them one or two men who had already heard of the duel imparted the information to the sylphlike ladies, who received it with little shrieks of humane concern.|$|E

5000|$|FAIR, {{founded by}} Frazer in 1998, claims to {{represent}} the victims of IRA violence in South Armagh. It has been criticised by some for not doing the same for victims of loyalist paramilitary organisations or for those killed by security forces. In the past, Frazer had said of loyalist paramilitary prisoners that [...] "they {{should never have been}} locked up in the first place", and that he had [...] "a lot of time for Billy Wright". He has also defended security force collusion with loyalist paramilitaries, stating in an interview with Susan McKay: [...] "If you were in the UDR and your brother was shot, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> you wouldn't information on to loyalists? ... See if a Paki comes from India and kills a Provo? I'm going to shake his hand." ...|$|E
5000|$|The word ‘Tuhao’ {{has gone}} viral {{recently}} since its first appearance {{as a joke}} on the Chinese social platform Weibo in 2013: A young man asks a Buddhist monk, ‘I'm wealthy, but unhappy. What should I do?’ The Buddhist monk says, [...] "Define 'wealthy.' [...] " [...] The young man answers, ‘I have millions in the bank and three apartments in central Beijing. Is that wealthy?’ The Buddhist monk silently holds out a hand. The young man says: ‘Master, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> that I should be thankful and give back?’ Instead of telling him to live a simple and happy life, the Buddhist monk replied ‘Tuhao, let’s be friends!” The joke implies that the tuhao’s wealth was so substantial that it even made a Buddhist monk greedy.|$|E

5000|$|... "Miss Lillian" [...] was a {{favorite}} of the press for her Southern charm and down-to-earth manner. For reporters and interrogators alike, she always had a warm country sass response for every question. One biographer recalls a story about a 1976 encounter between Carter and a reporter from New York who flew down to Plains to meet her: [...] "Miss Lillian greeted her, and said 'Welcome to Plains! It's so nice to see you! Would you like some lemonade? How was your journey? Your dress is beautiful'; pouring out the southern hospitality. And the reporter jumped right in on Miss Lillian and said 'Now Miss Lillian, your son's running for president and said he'll never tell a lie now, as a mother, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> he's never told a lie?' And she goes 'oh, Jimmy tells white lies all the time!' the reporter said 'Tell me what you mean: what is a 'white lie'" [...] And Miss Lillian said 'Remember when I said [...] "Welcome to Plains and how good it is to see you. That's a white lie'" ...|$|E

A Model of the Social Function 2 In an effort to stimulate and guide empirical work within a functional framework. this paper provides a {{conceptual model}} of the social functions of autobiographical memory (AM) across the lifespan. The model delineates the processes and variables involved when AMs are shared to serve social functions. Components of the model include: lifespan contextual influences, the qualitative characteristics of memory (emotionality and level of detail recalled), the speaker’s characteristics (age, gender, and personality), the familiarity and similarity of the listener to the speaker, the level of responsiveness during the memory sharing process, {{and the nature of}} the social relationship in which the memory sharing occurs (valence and length of the relationship). These components are shown to influence the type of social function served and, or, the extent to which social functions are served. Directions for future empirical work to substantiate the model and hypotheses derived from the model are provided...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a nice}} {{scene in}} Annie Hall where Woody Allen’s character, standup Alvy Singer, meets Carol Kane’s character, stage manager Allison Portchnik. Waiting in the wings at a variety show, Singer remonstrates with Portchnik over the scheduling. “What do you mean, ‘next’?” he asks with amazement. “I’m not going after another comedian... because they’re laughing... so what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> <b>me?</b> They’re gonna laugh {{at him for a}} couple of minutes then I’ve gotta go out there and get laughs too? How much can they laugh? They’re laughed out!” I know how he feels. Our {{previous}} special issue— Experimental Writing about Music, edited by David Gutkin—is impossible to follow. But only in that sense do I relate to Singer: although Experimental Writing has its laugh–out–loud moments, it is also possibly the most ambitious and unique volume of Current Musicology to date. (If you haven’t already, find it at our website or order a hard copy). For the present issue, general operations resume: the articles collected here continue the journal’s unabating commitment to diverse content, high–quality scholarship, and rigorous peer review...|$|E
