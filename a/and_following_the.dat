Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of}} the revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Between 911 and 919, Edward {{expanded}} his {{control over the}} rest of England south of the Humber, establishing in Essex and Mercia burhs, often designed to control the use of a river by the Danes. In 917, the Danish position in the area suddenly collapsed. A rapid succession of defeats culminated in the loss of the territories of Northampton and Huntingdon, along with the remainder of Essex: a Danish king, probably from East Anglia, was killed at Tempsford. Despite reinforcement from overseas, the Danish counter-attacks were crushed, <b>and</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> defection of many of their English subjects as Edward's army advanced, the Danes of East Anglia and Cambridge both capitulated.|$|E
