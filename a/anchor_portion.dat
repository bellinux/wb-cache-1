40|$|Flame {{lengths of}} gas jet {{diffusion}} flames were measured under various gravity evels. A spin tester {{was used to}} obtain a high gravity field which level was changed from normal gravity (G= 1) to G- 20. In order to investigate the fuel density effect on flame structure at high gravity level, two kinds of fuels (methane and propanw) and further methane-propane mixture fuel whose density was equivalent to the surrounding air were used. As the results, flame length decreased with an increase of gravity level regardless of {{the positive and negative}} buoyancy effect between the fuel and surroundings. To investigate the gravity effect on flame structure, length of blue flame which appeared at <b>anchor</b> <b>portion</b> of the flame was measured under various gravity levels. It was confirmed that the blue flame was expanded with an increase of the gravity level. This result was explained by the enhancement of the air entrainment at the <b>anchor</b> <b>portion</b> of the flame. Evaluation of flame length which was obtained by Altenkirch considering the relationship of fuel and required oxygen were used to evaluate the experimental data of flame length under the various gravity level. From this method the following empirical correlation was proposed : L_f/γ_o= 1. 72 Re^ Fγ^, where L_f is a flame length, γ_o is a nozzle radius, Re is the Reynolds number based on nozzle radius and Fγ is the Froude number...|$|E
40|$|The {{terminal}} {{electron transfer}} enzyme fumarate reductase {{has been shown}} to be composed of a membrane-extrinsic catalytic dimer of 69 - and 27 -kilodalton (kd) subunits and a membrane-intrinsic <b>anchor</b> <b>portion</b> of 15 - and 13 -kd subunits. We prepared inverted membrane vesicles from a strain carrying the frd operon on a multicopy plasmid. When grown anaerobically on fumarate-containing medium, the membranes of this strain are highly enriched in fumarate reductase. When negatively stained preparations of these vesicles were examined with an electron microscope, they appeared to be covered with knob-like structures about 4 nm in diameter attached to the membrane by short stalks. Treatment of the membranes with chymotrypsin destroyed the 69 -kd subunit, leaving the 27 -, 15 -, and 13 -kd subunits bound to the membrane; these membranes appeared to retain remnants of the structure. Treatment of the membranes with 6 M urea removed the 69 - and 27 -kd subunits, leaving the anchor polypeptides intact. These vesicles appeared smooth and structureless. A functional four-subunit enzyme and the knob-like structure could be reconstituted by the addition of soluble catalytic subunits to the urea-stripped membranes. In addition to the vesicular structures, we observed unusual tubular structures which were covered with a helical array of fumarate reductase knobs...|$|E

40|$|Social Network Capital and Academic Careers: The Case of a College of Agriculture ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between economic performance and {{various forms of}} capital <b>anchors</b> a significant <b>portion</b> of mainstream economic theory and applied economics. Human, physical and financial capital represent important factors {{in the production of}} goods and services. The label “capital” implies characteristics such as investment, accumulation, maintenance, depreciation, and transfer. Recently, social capital or social network capital (SNC) has received increased scholarly attention in the literature of sociology, business, and economics. Limited analysis, however, has been directed at the role of SNC in the academy. We hypothesize that academic success at the professorial level is determined by the stock of human (HC) and SNC and the value flows emerging from these stocks. We view SNC as a complement to HC, increasing the productivity of HC while holding all other factors constant. An analysis of SNC’s importance to academic career success should interest the academy as well as other large organizations (i. e. research laboratories, government agencies) with similar structures and incentive systems.

40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to {{sequence}} the genome of Rattus norvegicus, we constructed a physical map comprised of fingerprinted bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones from the CHORI- 230 BAC library. These BAC clones provide ~ 13 -fold redundant coverage of the genome and have been assembled into 376 fingerprint contigs. A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) map was also constructed and aligned with the BAC map via fingerprinted BAC and P 1 artificial chromosome clones (PACs) sharing interspersed repetitive sequence markers with the YAC-based physical map. We have annotated 95 % of the fingerprint map clones in contigs with coordinates on the version 3. 1 rat genome sequence assembly, using BAC-end sequences and in silico mapping methods. These coordinates have allowed anchoring 358 of the 376 fingerprint map contigs onto the sequence assembly. Of these, 324 contigs are anchored to rat genome sequences localized to chromosomes, and 34 contigs are <b>anchored</b> to unlocalized <b>portions</b> of the rat sequence assembly. The remaining 18 contigs, containing 54 clones, still require placement.

40|$|Abstract Location {{information}} {{is critical to}} mobile wireless sensor networks (WSN) appli-cations. With the help of location information, for example, routing can be performed more efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel localization approach, Color-theory based Dynamic Localization (CDL), {{which is based on}} color theory to exploit localization in mobile WSNs. CDL makes use of the broadcast information, such as locations and RGB values, from all <b>anchors</b> (a small <b>portion</b> of nodes with GPS receivers attached), to help the server to create a location database and assist each sensor node to compute its RGB value. Then, the RGB values of all sensor nodes are sent to the server for localization of the sensor nodes. A unique feature of our color-theory based mechanism is that it can use one color to represent the distances of a sensor node to all anchors. Since CDL is easy to implement and is a centralized approach, it is very suitable for applications that need a centralized server to collect user (sensor) data and monitor user activities, such as community health-care systems and hospital monitoring systems. Evaluation results have shown that for mobile WSNs, the location accuracy of CDL (E-CDL, an enhanced version of CDL) is 40 – 50 % (75 – 80 %) better than that of MCL (Hu, L., & Evans, D. (2004). Localization for mobile sensor networks. In Proceedings of the 10 th annual international conference on mobile computing and network-ing, pp. 45 – 57). In addition, we have implemented and validated our E-CDL algorithm on the MICAz Mote Developer’s Kit...|$|R
