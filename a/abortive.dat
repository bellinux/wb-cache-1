5|$|An <b>abortive</b> {{effort to}} support the French {{invasion}} fleet was also made by the Navy of the Batavian Republic, which despatched the small frigates Furie and Waakzaamheid to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October. Within hours of leaving port, both these ships were intercepted and captured by the British frigate HMS Sirius under the young Captain Richard King at the Action of 24 October 1798.|$|E
5|$|Gondjout {{served as}} Minister of State during the <b>abortive</b> 1964 Gabon coup d'état but {{was acquitted of}} all charges during his {{subsequent}} trial. He lived outside public view from his 1966 acquittal to his death on 1 July 1990 {{and there is little}} record of his life during this period.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, {{the ship}} was present when the Pacific Squadron sortied in an <b>abortive</b> attempt to reach Vladivostok, but the new {{squadron}} commander, Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, ordered the squadron to return to Port Arthur when it encountered the Japanese battleline shortly before sunset, as he {{did not wish to}} engage his numerically superior opponents in a night battle.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsukue {{neighborhood}} prospered as a port town {{during the}} feudal period, {{as it was}} used as a port of rest for daimyōs on their way to and from the capital as part of the sankin-kōtai system. This traffic was likely the source of the demand for Nobutaka's <b>abortive</b> attempt to create a shortcut through the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The airmen of 9./JG28 spent {{a couple}} of {{relaxing}} months in Bucharest, outside the close scrutiny of Berlin. Graf even managed to play football when a Luftwaffe team played against Cyclope Bucharesti at the Bucharest Sports Arena before 30,000 spectators. During its time in Romania, the unit was witness to a major earthquake in November and an <b>abortive</b> civil war in January.|$|E
5|$|The table {{does not}} include the {{numerous}} whaling voyages that took place during this period, or sub-Antarctic expeditions such as that of Carl Chun in 1898–99, which did not penetrate the Antarctic circle. The <b>abortive</b> Cope Expedition of 1920–22, which collapsed through lack of funding, is likewise excluded, though two men were landed from a Norwegian whaler and spent a year on the Antarctic peninsula.|$|E
5|$|A and C Squadrons {{supported}} a costly, <b>abortive</b> 15 July attack on Ruweisat Ridge and the regiment retreated as the division dug {{in at the}} boxes. Two troops were dispatched to join the 18th Battalion on 22 July, encountering an Axis pocket and losing a troop commander. The regiment was incorporated into the New Zealand Divisional box; A and C Squadrons dug in, and B Squadron patrolled south. On 17 and 18 August, A and C Squadrons were relieved by the Buffs and Royal West Kents and moved out.|$|E
5|$|After {{fallout from}} the {{unsuccessful}} Ogaden campaign of the late 1970s, the Barre administration began arresting government and military officials under suspicion {{of participation in the}} <b>abortive</b> 1978 coup d'état. Most of the people who had allegedly helped plot the putsch were summarily executed. However, several officials managed to escape abroad and started to form the first of various dissident groups dedicated to ousting Barre's regime by force.|$|E
5|$|Asar-i Tevfik {{served in}} the Ottoman fleet {{for more than four}} decades. During this period, she saw action in two major wars, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and the First Balkan War in 1913. During the first conflict, she was torpedoed by a Russian torpedo boat but was only {{slightly}} damaged. She took part in the <b>abortive</b> Battle of Elli against the Greek Navy in December 1912 during the First Balkan War. While operating against Bulgarian positions in February 1913, she ran aground; Bulgarian field artillery then shelled the ship. The damage they inflicted, coupled with heavy seas, destroyed the ship.|$|E
5|$|Brought {{up in the}} Rhondda Valley, Paul {{became a}} miner after leaving school, but an offer of a {{professional}} contract from Swansea gave {{him the opportunity to}} leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49. Transfer listed after an <b>abortive</b> move to Colombian club Millonarios, Paul joined Manchester City for £19,500 in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|By the early-20th century, Dhaka {{projected}} {{itself as}} the standard bearer of Muslim minorities in British India; {{as opposed to the}} heavily Hindu-dominated city of Calcutta. During the <b>abortive</b> Partition of Bengal in 1905, Dhaka became the short lived capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1906, the All India Muslim League was formed at the Ahsan Manzil, during a conference on liberal education hosted by Nawab Sir Khawja Salimullah. Bengal was reunited in 1911. The University of Dacca was established in 1921. DEVCO, a subsidiary of the Occtavian Steel Company, began widescale power distribution in 1930.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an <b>abortive</b> fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days of}} the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany in 1688 sought Violante Beatrice as {{a prestigious}} bride — Bavaria {{was one of}} the most {{powerful}} states of the Holy Roman Empire — for his elder son and heir, Ferdinando, Grand Prince of Tuscany. As Cosimo's father, Ferdinando II, had embroiled Elector Ferdinand Maria in an <b>abortive</b> financial venture costing him 450,000 ungheri worth of gold, relations between Munich and Florence were sour.|$|E
5|$|He {{was later}} {{president}} of the youth wing of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, and aligned himself with Dennis Timbrell during the latter's <b>abortive</b> campaign for the PC leadership in 1989 and 1990. He backed Mike Harris when Timbrell withdrew from the contest. Baird has also indicated that {{he was charged with}} trespassing during the 1988 federal election, after he tried to question Ontario Premier David Peterson about free trade with the United States during a Liberal Party campaign stop in a Kingston shopping mall. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Studies from Queen's University in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Khrushchev met {{and married}} his second wife, Marusia, whose maiden name is unknown. The two soon separated, though Khrushchev helped Marusia in later years, {{especially}} when Marusia's daughter by a previous relationship suffered a fatal illness. Soon after the <b>abortive</b> marriage, Khrushchev met Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants. The two lived together {{as husband and wife}} for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they did not register their marriage until 1965. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for <b>abortive</b> {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' {{activities}} are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey and perhaps a canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|On 2324 April 1918, {{the ship}} {{participated in an}} <b>abortive</b> fleet {{operation}} to attack British convoys to Norway. The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group, along with the Second Torpedo-Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway, {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet steaming in support. The Germans failed to locate the convoy, which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port. As a result, Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Booth and {{the other}} conspirators planned to abduct Lincoln as he {{returned}} from a play at Campbell Military Hospital. But Lincoln {{did not go to}} the play, instead attending a ceremony at the National Hotel; Booth was living at the National Hotel at the time and, had he not gone to the hospital for the <b>abortive</b> kidnap attempt, {{might have been able to}} attack Lincoln at the hotel.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} over a couple of months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his <b>abortive</b> sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|That {{evening the}} Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes his {{new best friend}} back to his mansion for champagne, then (after another <b>abortive</b> suicide attempt) out for {{a night on the}} town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street-corner. The Tramp gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire's car.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj {{socio-cultural}} reform movements significantly {{influenced the}} cultural and economic life of Bengal. Between 1905 and 1911 an <b>abortive</b> {{attempt was made to}} divide the province of Bengal into two zones. Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943, which claimed 3million lives during World WarII. Bengalis {{played a major role in}} the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant. Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army from Southeast Asia against the British.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal is a canal in the {{south-west}} of England between Bridgwater and Taunton, {{opened in}} 1827 and linking the River Tone to the River Parrett. There {{were a number}} of <b>abortive</b> schemes to link the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by waterway in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These schemes followed the approximate route eventually taken by the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, but the canal was instead built as part of a plan to link Bristol to Taunton by waterway.|$|E
5|$|The Diolkos {{remained}} reportedly {{in regular}} service {{until at least}} {{the middle of the}} 1st centuryAD, after which no more written references appear. Possibly the trackway was put out of use by Nero's <b>abortive</b> canal works in 67AD. Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 are assumed to have used a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E
5|$|The Helgoland-class ships {{operated}} {{as a unit}} in the High Seas Fleet; {{they served}} as the IDivision of the IBattle Squadron. The ships of the class participated in several fleet operations in the North Sea, including the sortie on 31 May 1916 {{that resulted in the}} Battle of Jutland. The ships also saw limited service in the Baltic Sea, primarily during the <b>abortive</b> Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915.|$|E
5|$|The Tevis novel {{had been}} optioned several times, {{including}} by Frank Sinatra, but attempts to adapt {{it for the}} screen were unsuccessful. Director Rossen's daughter Carol Rossen speculates that previous adaptations focused {{too much on the}} pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction. Rossen, who had hustled pool himself as a youth and who had made an <b>abortive</b> attempt to write a pool-themed play called Corner Pocket, optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abortive</b> Ivelchester and Langport Navigation scheme {{had sought}} to avoid the Great Bow Bridge by making the Portlake Rhine navigable, {{rebuilding}} Little Bow Bridge in the centre of Langport, and making a new cut to Bicknell's Bridge. Seven locks, each with a small rise, were planned, but the scheme foundered in 1797 due to financial difficulties. After the cessation of hostilities with France {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century, there was renewed interest in canal building in Somerset; the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was authorised in 1824, the Glastonbury Canal in 1827, and the Chard Canal in 1834.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abortive</b> {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full {{mobilization}} of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, and Montgomery occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E
5|$|The sterile diploid {{hybrid of}} A.montanum and A.platyneuron, which resembles A.bradleyi except for its <b>abortive</b> spores and smaller sori, was not {{collected}} until 1972, at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia. Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme {{studies show that}} A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the chromosome doubling of independently formed diploids. Despite their independent origins, these populations are probably interfertile and not reproductively isolated from one another.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her return}} to service, Grosser Kurfürst resumed picket duties in the Bight. She was present during the <b>abortive</b> anti-convoy {{operation}} on 23–25 April 1918. While entering the lock outside Wilhelmshaven following {{the conclusion of the}} operation, the ship was damaged. She was back in dock for repairs from 27 April to 2 May. At the end of the month, Grosser Kurfürst ran aground just off the Helgoland's north harbor. The ship's port-side propeller shaft was bent, necessitating repairs at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel from 2–9 June and 21–31 July. She finally rejoined the fleet on 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Amid renewed rumours of an {{impending}} Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London {{at the start}} of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its Twenty-Four Hours evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely <b>abortive</b> talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an <b>abortive</b> coup, then {{postponed}} a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Bayern was {{commissioned}} {{midway through the}} war, and had a limited service career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an <b>abortive</b> fleet advance into the North Sea on 18–19 August 1916, a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga, but shortly after the German attack began on 12 October 1917, Bayern was mined {{and had to be}} withdrawn for repairs. She was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow in November 1918 following the end of World War I. On 21 June 1919, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the fleet to be scuttled; Bayern sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised, towed to Rosyth, and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive <b>abortive</b> coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|Each cavalry {{regiment}} was {{to consist}} of four cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, and an engineer squadron. Shortly before the war, an <b>abortive</b> {{attempt was made to}} motorise the 1st Cavalry Division, but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence. The 1st Cavalry Division was also never equipped with the planned motorised anti-tank battery, and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. Two peacetime components of the division, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and 3rd Cavalry Regiment, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade, commanding the 2nd, 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments.|$|E
5|$|From 10 to 16 December, the {{regiment}} established {{a chain of}} posts on the roads south of Bardia to prevent Axis movement. The 2nd South African Division, supported by Aand C Squadrons, made an <b>abortive</b> attack on Bardia on 16December; the 2nd South African battalions retreated two days later. The regiment participated in a deception operation, concealing the attack on Bardia with dummy tanks in the desert. On 2 January 1942, Lieutenant E. W. Kerr of {{the regiment}} accepted the surrender of German General Artur Schmitt, commander of the Bardia garrison. C Squadron became the first Allied force to enter Bardia. HQ and B Squadrons entered Bardia after Kerr's troop, releasing Allied prisoners. On 6 January, the regiment left Bardia for Baggush, returning to Maadi on 26 January.|$|E
