25|$|Damage {{and injury}} in the brain can {{severely}} lower ones ability to communicate, and therefore lower ones linguistic intelligence. Common forms of major damage are strokes, concussions, brain tumors, viral/bacterial damage, and drug-related damage. The three major linguistic disorders that result from these injuries are aphasia, alexia, and <b>agraphia.</b> Aphasia is the inability to speak, and {{can be caused by}} damage to Broca's area or the motor cortex. Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to Wernicke's area, among other places. <b>Agraphia</b> is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to Broca's area or the motor cortex. In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of acquired amusia {{are much more}} variable than those of congenital amusia and {{are determined by the}} location and nature of the lesion. Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical <b>agraphia).</b> Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).|$|E
50|$|<b>Agraphia</b> has {{two main}} subgroupings: central ("aphasic") <b>agraphia</b> and {{peripheral}} ("nonaphasic") <b>agraphia.</b> Central agraphias include , phonological, deep, and semantic <b>agraphia.</b> Peripheral agraphias include allographic, apraxic, motor execution, hemianoptic and afferent <b>agraphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Deep <b>agraphia</b> {{involves}} {{damage to}} the same {{areas of the brain}} as lexical <b>agraphia</b> plus some {{damage to the}} perisylvian language areas as well. More extensive left hemisphere damage can lead to global <b>agraphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Agraphia</b> is an {{acquired}} neurological disorder causing {{a loss in}} the ability to communicate through writing, either due to some form of motor dysfunction or an inability to spell. The loss of writing ability may present with other language or neurological disorders; disorders appearing commonly with <b>agraphia</b> are alexia, aphasia, dysarthria, agnosia, and apraxia. The study of individuals with <b>agraphia</b> may provide more information about the pathways involved in writing, both language related and motoric. <b>Agraphia</b> cannot be directly treated, but individuals can learn techniques to help regain and rehabilitate some of their previous writing abilities. These techniques differ {{depending on the type of}} <b>agraphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Agraphia</b> can be broadly {{divided into}} central and {{peripheral}} categories. Central agraphias typically involve language {{areas of the}} brain, causing difficulty spelling or with spontaneous communication, and are often accompanied by other language disorders. Peripheral agraphias usually target motor and visuospatial skills in addition to language and tend to involve motoric {{areas of the brain}}, causing difficulty in the movements associated with writing. Central <b>agraphia</b> may also be called aphasic <b>agraphia</b> as it involves areas of the brain whose major functions are connected to language and writing; peripheral <b>agraphia</b> may also be called nonaphasic <b>agraphia</b> as it involves areas of the brain whose functions are not directly connected to language and writing (typically motor areas).|$|E
5000|$|Central <b>agraphia</b> {{occurs when}} there are both {{impairments}} in spoken language and impairments to the various motor and visualization skills involved in writing. Individuals who have <b>agraphia</b> with fluent aphasia write a normal quantity of well-formed letters, but lack the ability to write meaningful words. Receptive aphasia {{is an example of}} fluent aphasia. [...] Those who have <b>agraphia</b> with nonfluent aphasia can write brief sentences but their writing is difficult to read. Their writing requires great physical effort but lacks proper syntax and often has poor spelling. Expressive aphasia is an example of nonfluent aphasia. [...] Individuals who have Alexia with <b>agraphia</b> have difficulty with both the production and comprehension of written language. This form of <b>agraphia</b> does not impair spoken language.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agraphia</b> {{is often}} seen in {{association}} with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Writing disorders can be an early manifestation of AD. In individuals with AD, the first sign pertaining to writing skills is the selective syntactic simplification of their writing. Individuals will write with less description, detail and complexity, and other markers, such as grammatical errors, may emerge. Different agraphias may develop as AD progresses. In the beginning stages of AD, individuals show signs of allographic <b>agraphia</b> and apraxic <b>agraphia.</b> Allographic <b>agraphia</b> is represented in AD individuals by the mixing of lower and upper case letters in words; apraxic <b>agraphia</b> is represented in AD patients through poorly constructed or illegible letters and omission or over repetition of letter strokes. As their AD progresses, so does the severity of their agraphia; they may begin to form spatial <b>agraphia,</b> which is the inability to write in a straight horizontal line, and there are often unnecessary gaps between letters and words.|$|E
5000|$|Reiterative <b>agraphia</b> {{is found}} in {{individuals}} who repeat letters, words, or phrases in written language production an abnormal number of times. Preservation, paragraphia, and echographia are examples of reiterative <b>agraphia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Apraxic <b>agraphia</b> is the {{impairment}} in written language production associated with {{disruption of the}} motor system. It results in distorted, slow, effortful, incomplete, and/or imprecise letter formation. Though written letters are often so poorly formed that they are almost illegible, the ability to spell aloud is often retained. This form of <b>agraphia</b> is caused specifically by a loss of specialized motor plans {{for the formation of}} letters and not by any dysfunction affecting the writing hand. Apraxic <b>agraphia</b> may present with or without ideomotor apraxia. Paralysis, chorea, Parkinson's disease (micrographia), and dystonia (writer's cramp) are motor disorders commonly associated with <b>agraphia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apraxic <b>agraphia</b> with {{ideomotor apraxia}} is {{typically}} caused by {{damage to the}} superior parietal lobe (where graphomotor plans are stored) or the premotor cortex (where the plans are converted into motor commands). Additionally, some individuals with cerebellar lesions (more typically associated with non-apraxic motor dysfunction) develop apraxic <b>agraphia.</b> Apraxic <b>agraphia</b> without ideomotor apraxia {{may be caused by}} damage to either of the parietal lobes, the dominant frontal lobe, or to the dominant thalamus.|$|E
5000|$|Phonological <b>agraphia</b> is the {{opposite}} of lexical <b>agraphia</b> in that the ability to sound out words is impaired, but the orthographical memory of words may be intact. It is associated with a lexicality effect by a difference in the ability to spell words versus nonwords; individuals with this form of <b>agraphia</b> are depending on their orthographic memory. Additionally, it is often harder for these individuals to access more abstract words without strong semantic representations (i.e., it is more difficult for them to spell prepositions than concrete nouns).|$|E
50|$|In 1867, William Ogle, who {{coined the}} term <b>agraphia,</b> made several key {{observations}} about the patterns of dissociation found in written and spoken language. He demonstrated that some patients with writing impairments were able to copy written letters but struggled arranging the letters to form words. Ogle knew that aphasia and <b>agraphia</b> often occurred together, but he confirmed that the impairment of {{two different types of}} language (spoken and written) can vary in type and severity. Although Ogle's review helped make important advancements toward understanding writing disorders, a documented case of pure <b>agraphia</b> was missing.|$|E
5000|$|Global <b>agraphia</b> also impairs an individuals' orthographic memory {{although}} to {{a greater}} extent than deep <b>agraphia.</b> In global apraxia, spelling knowledge is lost to such a degree that the individual can only write very few meaningful words, or cannot write any words at all. Reading and spoken language are also markedly impaired.|$|E

50|$|For the {{management}} of phonological <b>agraphia,</b> individuals are trained to memorize key words, such as a familiar name or object, that can then help them form the grapheme for that phoneme. Management of allographic <b>agraphia</b> {{can be as simple}} as having alphabet cards so the individual can write legibly by copying the correct letter shapes. There are few rehabilitation methods for apraxic agraphia; if the individual has considerably better hand control and movement with typing than they do with handwriting, then they can use technological devices. Texting and typing do not require the same technical movements that handwriting does; for these technological methods, only spatial location of the fingers to type is required. If copying skills are preserved in an individual with apraxic <b>agraphia,</b> repeated copying may help shift from the highly intentional and monitored hand movements indicative of apraxic <b>agraphia</b> to a more automated control.|$|E

5000|$|Visuospatial <b>agraphia</b> is the {{impairment}} in written language production {{defined by a}} tendency to neglect one portion (often an entire side) of the writing page, slanting lines upward or downward, and abnormal spacing between letters, syllables, and words. The orientation and correct sequencing of the writing will also be impaired. Visuospatial <b>agraphia</b> is frequently associated with left hemispatial neglect, difficulty in building or assembling objects, and other spatial difficulties.|$|E

50|$|Dysgraphia {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>agraphia,</b> which is an acquired loss {{of the ability to}} write resulting from brain injury, stroke, or progressive illness.|$|E
5000|$|Deep <b>agraphia</b> affects an individuals' phonological {{ability and}} orthographic memory. Deep <b>agraphia</b> {{is often the}} result of a lesion {{involving}} the left parietal region (supramarginal gyrus or insula). Individuals can neither remember how words look when spelled correctly, nor sound them out to determine spelling. Individuals typically rely on their damaged orthographic memory to spell; this results in frequent errors, usually semantic in nature. Individuals have more difficulty with abstract concepts and uncommon words. Reading and spoken language are often impaired as well.|$|E
50|$|Lexical <b>agraphia</b> is {{associated}} with damage to the left angular gyrus and/or posterior temporal cortex. The damage is typically posterior and inferior to the perisylvian language areas.|$|E

5000|$|Lexical and {{structural}} <b>agraphia</b> {{are caused by}} damage to the orthographic memory; these individuals cannot visualize the spelling of a word, though they do retain the ability to sound them out. This impaired spelling memory can imply the loss or degradation of the knowledge or just an inability to efficiently access it. There is a regularity effect associated with lexical <b>agraphia</b> in that individuals {{are less likely to}} correctly spell words without regular, predictable spellings. Additionally, spelling ability tends to be less impaired for common words. Individuals also have difficulty with homophones. Language competence in terms of grammar and sentence writing tends to be preserved.|$|E
