50|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser naccarii) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Acipenseridae. It is native to the Adriatic Sea and large rivers in Albania, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. Specimens {{can be seen at}} the Milan Aquarium, Aquarium Finisterrae, Aquarium of the Po, and the {{protected}} area of Oasis of Sant'Alessio in Lombardy. It is an elongated fish that can grow to a maximum length of about 2 m, with an olive-brown back, paler flanks and whitish belly.|$|E
50|$|The captive {{broodstock}} {{for this}} programme comprises about 25 individual fish. The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is a tetraploid fish (has {{four sets of}} chromosomes) and research based on mitochondrial and microsatellite information is being done on the present breeding stock and other young fish to establish how best to increase the genetic diversity of the fish used in the breeding programme, because the current broodstock {{has been shown to}} retain only part of the genetic variation present in the original stock. Despite the release of captive bred fish, no signs of spawning have been observed in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> {{reaches a}} maximum length of about 2 m and a maximum weight of 25 kg. Like other {{sturgeons}} it has an elongated body, a flattened rostrum, a cartilaginous skeleton, distinctive bony scutes, and an elongated upper lobe to its tail. The snout is broad and rounded, the lower lip has a central cleft and the four barbels are closer {{to the tip of}} the snout than they are to the mouth. The dorsal fin has no spines and 36 to 48 soft rays, and the anal fin has 24 to 31 soft rays. The dorsal colouring is olive-brown, the flanks are paler and the underside white.|$|E
50|$|Like most sturgeon, the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is an {{anadromous}} {{fish and}} can be found at different periods of its life in freshwater and marine environments, including estuaries and brackish water. Historically it was {{to be found in the}} Adriatic Sea and the rivers flowing into it on either side. In 1932 its range in the sea was reported to be from Venice and Trieste to Greece and Corfu. It used to be present in the rivers Adige, Brenta, Bacchiglione, Piave, Livenza and Tagliamento. In the Po and its tributaries, it used to be present as far upstream as Turin. It also traditionally occurred in the Ticino and Adda rivers along the Albanian coasts, and in the rivers of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, including Lake Skadar. It was reported from Greece in 1977 but is no longer found there, and from Albania in 1997 in the Buna River, but has not been seen there since.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> faces {{a number}} of threats such as {{pollution}} of rivers by industrial effluent and agricultural runoff and the fragmentation of their habitat by damming, which prevents them from moving upstream to suitable spawning areas. They are also caught legally or illegally and this is particularly harmful when smaller fish are taken before they have reached maturity and reproduced at least once. They also face competition from the wels catfish (Silurus glanis) which has expanded its range into Western Europe. As they have become fewer in number they {{are affected by the}} Allee effect which postulates that a fish's growth rate is reduced at low population densities. No spawning has been observed in the wild for {{a number of}} years and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the conservation status of this fish as [...] "critically endangered" [...] and possibly [...] "extinct in the wild". [...] However, a number of organisations are concerned in attempts to preserve this species and a captive breeding scheme has been established, with young fish subsequently being released into the wild.|$|E

40|$|In the Po River area {{three species}} of {{sturgeons}} {{have been recorded}} during the seventies; of these, the sturgeon (Acipenser sfurio), and the beluga (Huso huso), up to now have practically disappeared from the river. Only the endemic <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser naccarii, is still present and captured by fìshermen, but its abundance is relatively low. The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> grows less than its congenerics, attaining the maximum length of 161 ± 14 cm. Nonetheless, during first years of life it grows very quickly: {{at the end of}} second year it is about 50 cm long and weights about 1 Kg. Later on, it needs about 10 years to achieve the size of 1 m and thè weight of 8 - 9 Kg. Sexual maturation of males starts when they are longer than 80 cm, and 6 to 8 years old: on the contrary, mature females occur only when they overcome the length of 100 cm. Most of the examined Adriatic sturgeons are parasitized by acantocephalans: when heavy affected, their growth performances are also reduced. The abundance of the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> population was heavily compromised by fìshing: more than 80 % out of about 2000 specimens sold at the fish market during the 1981 - 88 period weighted less than 3. 5 Kg and were therefore fished before the reproductive phase.

40|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser naccarii (Bonaparte, 1836), is {{a highly}} {{threatened}} species due to human activities, particularly overfishing and habitat destruction. Its peculiar ecology and biology (restricted areal and anadromy) makes this species particularly vulnerable. In March 2010 the IUCN has identified the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> as a critically endangered species according to the Red List of Threatened Species. Due to its rapid decline, starting from the 80 s, at present {{there is no evidence}} of natural reproduction in wild environment, which makes the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> dependenton captive breeding programs that need to be improved in order to be effective for the survival of the species. For this purpose this study aims to characterize artificial restocking population of <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> with both genetic and physiological analysis in order to establish an efficient restocking program for future reproductions. The research is structured on two levels: First genetically, by analyzing 9 microsatellite loci. This gives information relatively about parent allocation and kinship between individuals that were sampled for this study. Hence to predict which reproduction events are the most optimal in terms of incrementing genetic diversity, by the estimation of multilocus pairwise band sharing coefficients. Second step, physiological analysis: testosterone (T) concentration levels in each individual were measured for sexing, without sacrificing the lives of the animals with the use of an invasive examination of the gonads. The combination of interdisciplinary analysis is important to obtain an overall picture in order to indicate the main broodstock participating in reproduction events and future optimal potential participants, in order to ensure a valid management for restocking program and their monitoring...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser naccarii) is a {{critically}} endangered endemism of the Adriatic region, with tetraploid genome and long life cycle.

40|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is {{a highly}} {{endangered}} tetraploid species whose conservation depends up ex-situ management of the remnant genetic variability. Understanding whether the species follows a tetrasomic or a disomic inheritance pattern is of primary importance {{to set up a}} parental allocation procedure and to establish a long-term breeding plan. Moreover, comprehending the inheritance modality can strongly contribute to understanding the origin of tetraploidy in this species. For this purpose, microsatellite inheritance patterns were analyzed in 7 complete families and at 7 loci for a total of 12 family/locus combinations. For each available family, a preliminary selection of loci was performed, in order to avoid ambiguities due to allele dosage, null alleles or interference between parental contributions. Results allowed to unambiguously reject a strict disomic inheritance pattern and to suggest tetrasomy as the more likely model. Accordingly, parental chromosomes can be expected to pair in the gametes in all possible combinations, though a certain degree of preferential pairing could not be excluded for the limited statistical power reached. This study represents the first investigation of the inheritance pattern in the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> and provides relevant information for the correct management of its residual genetic diversity.

40|$|Four {{sturgeon}} {{species have}} been reported to exist in Greek waters: the Atlantic sturgeon, the great sturgeon, the stellate sturgeon and the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon.</b> The Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser sturio L., 1758 has an almost regular presence in the Evros River (Aegean Sea), and is rather rare in the Pinios and Acheloos Rivers. The great sturgeon or beluga Huso huso L., 1758 is suspected to be an occasional visitor in Greek waters, or it is a case of undocumented information. The presence of the stellate sturgeon Acipenser stellatus Pallas, 1771 has been recently verified by a specimen caught close to the Thracian shore. The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836 is supposed to have its southern distribution limits in the waters around the island of Corfu, although this information has never been confirmed. The distribution of these species is obvi-ously related to salinity, probably prohibiting the extension of other sturgeon species to the Mediterranean, except for A. sturio. The discontinuous distribution of H. huso and A. stellatus may be a result of sea-level changes, while salinity played some role in the last period of glaciation. In the marine area of the Evros River A. sturio has been economically significant until 1975, sup-porting a small black caviar industry. Since then, the species has become rare mainly because of overfishing, and the reduction and pollution of the Evros River, in the upstream of which some important sturgeon spawning sites have been located...|$|E

Abstract The Russian sturgeon, Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, {{is closely related}} to three other sturgeon species (A. persicus, A. naccarii and A. baerii), with populations in the Caspian Sea containing a cryptic lineage with an A. baerii-like mtDNA profile. Using morphological evidence (morphometrics, meristics) and additional genetic analysis (cytochrome b gene and control region sequencing), cryptic lineages within the Russian sturgeon and their relation to other closely related species of sturgeons are further examined.

Twenty-seven species of sturgeon exist in the diverse habitats of the northern hemisphere including rivers, estuaries, near-shore oceanic environments, and inland seas. The Caspian Sea is the largest inland water body in the world. The greatest abundance of sturgeon inhabits in the Caspian Sea which is the largest and most important sturgeon fisheries (Ovissipour and Rasco 2012). Six species of sturgeon occur in the Caspian Sea basin (beluga, Russian, Persian, sterlet, stellate, ship; Pikitch et al. 2005). Fuelled by the lucrative international caviar market, the stocks of many sturgeon species have faced rapid declines (Bronzi et al. 2011).

40|$|AB Although {{analyses}} of intraspecific variability {{are an important}} prerequisite for species identification assays, only {{a few studies have}} focused on population genetics and historical biogeography of sturgeon species. Here we present the first study on genetic variability of the last remaining <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser naccarii, derived from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Our mitochondrial DNA analyses arranged individuals into three distinguished mitochondrial DNA haplogroups (Po 1, Po 2 and Buna). Two haplogroups (Po 1 and Buna) were correlated to geographical distribution, whereas the third (Po 2) was not. It was, however, very closely related to one lineage of its Ponto-Caspian sister species, A. gueldenstaedtii. The distribution of nuclear markers (microsatellites and amplified fragment length polymorphism) was strongly correlated to geographical distribution. An assignment test based on nuclear data placed no specimen of A. naccarii to A. gueldenstaedtii and vice versa. Therefore, the presence of gueldenstaedtii-like haplotypes within the Po population is either the result of a postglacial introgression or an ancestral polymorphism and does not indicate a hybrid population. The most valuable tool for forensic species identification purposes is one diagnostic deletion separating all A. naccarii from A. gueldenstaedtii. As both A. naccarii populations are genetically differentiated, stocking of sturgeon from the Po River in Italy into waters of the Buna River would jeopardize the genetic differences between both populations and should thus be avoided...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{isolation}} of a novel vitamin K-dependent protein from the calcified cartilage of <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser nacarii). This 10. 2 -kDa secreted protein contains 16 -carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues in its 74 -residue sequence, the highest Gla percent of any known protein, and we have therefore termed it Gla-rich protein (GRP). GRP has a high charge density (36 negative 16 positive 20 net negative) yet is insoluble at neutral pH. GRP has orthologs in all taxonomic groups of vertebrates, and a paralog (GRP 2) in bony fish; no GRP homolog was found in invertebrates. There is no significant sequence homology between GRP and the Gla-containing region of any presently known vitamin K-dependent protein. Forty-seven GRP sequences were obtained {{by a combination of}} cDNA cloning and comparative genomics: all 47 have a propeptide that contains a -carboxylase recognition site and a mature protein with 14 highly conserved Glu residues, each of them being carboxylated in sturgeon. The protein sequence of GRP is also highly conserved, with 78 % identity between sturgeon and human GRP. Analysis of the corresponding gene structures suggests a highly constrained organization, particularly for exon 4, which encodes the core Gla domain. GRP mRNA is found in virtually all rat and sturgeon tissues examined, with the highest expression in cartilage. Cells expressing GRP include chondrocytes, chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. Because of its potential to bind calcium through Gla residues, we suggest that GRP may regulate calcium in the extracellular environment...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the blood}} {{chemistry}} of a chondrostean fish, the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser naccarii), are reported as measured with different sampling procedures, and as related to rearing conditions and age. Serum cortisol, glucose, osmolality, Na+, Cr-, Ca 2 + and total protein concentrations were measured. Reference values for the blood chemistry of farmed sturgeon were measured on samples from resting undisturbed animals collected via a chronic indwelling catheter in the dorsal aorta that was implanted under anaesthesia. Following 24 h recovery from catheterization, serum cortisol, glucose and osmolality levels were 9. 4 ng/ml, 58. 8 mg/dl and 261. 4 mOsm/kg, respectively. Furthermore, blood samples collected with the chronic indwelling catheters indicated that the surgical procedure of cannulation caused a stress response, with physiological changes that followed a pattern like that described in teleosts. Cortisol, glucose and osmolality were more sensitive to stress than the other variables measured. Sampling by cardiac puncture tended {{to be associated with}} elevated serum cortisol levels in older, larger sturgeon, but not in young fish. Greater capture, confinement and handling stress in older, larger, sturgeon may have been responsible for this and other age-related differences in blood chemistry values measured following cardiac puncture. Within the same age class, both rearing conditions and temperature affected cortisol, sodium and total protein concentrations significantly. Anaesthesia did not appear to reduce the degree of stress associated with cardiac puncture but altered serum ion concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836), {{endemic to}} the North Adriatic region, was {{recently}} reclassified by IUCN as 'Critically endangered and possibly extinct in the wild' since no natural spawning {{has been recorded}} in the last 20 years. Its survival relies on restocking activities originating from a single captive broodstock collected by a private aquaculture plant (V. I. P.) in the 1970 s and is currently reduced to 13 individuals. Few alternative brood-stocks of F 1 animals have been retained {{for use in the}} near future. Thus far, brood-stocks, as well as all stocks released in the wild, have been randomly chosen without regard to their genetic composition. The consequence of breeding programmes with no genetic input was evaluated in the Ticino River Park (TRP) in Italy. A parental allocation procedure based on microsatellite markers useful for tetraploids was used following a Band-Sharing approach. Levels of relatedness within the TRP F 1 captive breeders (Stock_ 1) and among animals released by TRP in the past (Stock_ 2) were explored and compared with the stock of wild origin. The pronounced decrease in genetic diversity observed in the analysed sample suggests the need for complete reorganization and coordination of conservation efforts for this species, paying particular attention to the long-term preservation of the genetic diversity. Also identified is the only potentially suitable stock of F 1 animals that should be used as source of future breeders...|$|E
40|$|We {{obtained}} and characterized {{a satellite}} (st) DNA family named HindIII from the genomes of the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836, Siberian sturgeon Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869, and beluga sturgeon Huso huso (L., 1758). We {{did not find}} this stDNA in the genome of the Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser sturio L., 1758. The comparison of sturgeon species us-ing the HindIII stDNA revealed the following: (1) A. naccarii and A. baerii are closely related; (2) H. huso appears {{to belong to the}} genus Acipenser and, probably, Huso is not a separate genus with-in the Acipenserinae; (3) A. sturio differs from the other three studied species by the absence of the HindIII stDNA and, most likely, it represents a separate evolutionary lineage within the Acipenseridae. The data on the HindIII stDNA can be successfully used for species identification of sturgeon specimens captured in different European regions. Key words: Sturgeons, nuclear DNA, phylogenetic relationships, genetic identification. RESUMEN Caracterización genética de Acipenser sturio L., 1758 con relación a otras especies de esturión por medio de ADN satélite En este trabajo presentamos la caracterización del genoma de Acipenser sturio L., 1758 en relación con el genoma de Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836, Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869 y Huso huso (L., 1758) utilizando una familia de ADN satélite (la familia HindIII). Nuestro análisis revela que: (1) A. nac-carii y A. baerii son especies muy emparentadas; (2) H. huso aparece muy relacionada con las especies del género Acipenser y, probablemente, podría ser considerada como una especie perteneciente a dicho género, y (3) A. sturio difiere del resto de las especies analizadas, lo que sugiere que esta especie ha debido seguir un...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a new putatively active Tc 1 -like transposable element (Tana 1) in the genome of sturgeons, an ancient group of fish considered as living fossils. The complete sequence of Tana 1 was first characterized in the 454 -sequenced transcriptome of the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser naccarii) and then isolated from the genome of the same species and from 12 additional sturgeons including three genera of the Acipenseridae (Acipenser, Huso, Scaphirhynchus). The element has a total length of 1588 bp and presents inverted repeats of 210 bp, one of which partially overlapping the 3 ' region of the transposase gene. The spacing of the DDE motif within the catalytic domain in Tana 1 is unique (DD 38 E) and indicates that Tana 1 can be considered as the first representative of a new Tc 1 subfamily. The integrity of the native form (with no premature termination codons within the transposase), the presence of all expected functional domains and its occurrence in the sturgeon transcriptome suggest a current or recent activity of Tana 1. The presence of Tana 1 in the genome of the 13 sturgeon species in our study points to an ancient origin of the element that existed before the split of the group 170 million years ago. The dissemination of Tana 1 across sturgeon genomes could be interpreted by postulating vertical transmission from an ancestral Tana 1 with a particularly slow evolutionary rate Horizontal transmission might have also {{played a role in the}} dissemination of Tana 1 as evidenced by the presence of a complete copy in the genome of Atlantic salmon. Vertical and horizontal transmission are not mutually exclusive a id may have concurred in shaping the evolution of Tana 1. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Gonadogenesis {{in early}} {{developmental}} stages of Acipenser naccarii {{and influence of}} estrogen immersion on feminization. Abstract: Gonad development processes {{and the effects of}} a single 8 -hour immersion treatment with 17 -estradiol (E 2, 400 g L- 1) on sex differentiation in the <b>Adriatic</b> <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser naccarii, were investigated. After migration of germ cells, gonadal ridges appeared in 16 - to 18 -day old larvae and undifferentiated gonads in 55 - to 60 -day old larvae. Putative ovaries with notches in the germinal epithelium and presumed testes with smooth germinal epithelium appeared in 180 - 185 -day old juveniles. Ovaries with proliferating oogonia and early meiotic oocytes clusters were observed in 292 -day old juveniles. Testes did not exhibit germ cell mitosis until 430 days of age. Developmental stages in E 2 -treated animals closely followed those of controls up to 430 days. The treatment significantly increased the percentage of ovaries when administered to embryos about 1. 5 day before hatching, while did not significantly altered the normal 1 / 1 sex ratio when administered to 1. 5 -day old pre-larvae and 10 -day old larvae. An increase of body weight and length was detected in embryo treated groups: it was related to the larger percentage of females, since in control females a higher specific growth rate for weight and length was detected. The results suggest that E 2 did not act on gonad differentiation but rather on commitment of somatic cells involved in gonad morphogenesis. It is likely that in A. naccarii exogenous E 2 administration may act through a feedback mechanism of self-supporting steroid production and that steroids are the physiological inducers of sex differentiation, as in most teleosts. The E 2 -immersion treatment, easier than time-consuming administration through food, could be a good approach to control sex differentiation and caviar production...|$|E
