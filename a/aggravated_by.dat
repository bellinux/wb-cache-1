5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion. This is further <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> the economic depression that Brazil is facing since 2014, the largest in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> that circumstance; and will probably with the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} famous {{examples}} of a genetic trait <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> royal family intermarriage was the House of Habsburg, which inmarried particularly often and is known for the mandibular prognathism of the Habsburger (Unter) Lippe (otherwise known as the 'Habsburg jaw', 'Habsburg lip' or 'Austrian lip'"). This was typical for many Habsburg relatives over a period of six centuries.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> excess sulfur.|$|E
5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E

Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E

5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state. This was <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted {{against the}} Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> Wushe Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off {{against each other}} and the Japanese used Toda and Truku (Taroko) {{collaborators}} to massacre the Tkdaya. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident. The Truku had resisted and fought the Japanese before in the 1914 Truku war 太魯閣戰爭 but had since been pacified and collaborated with the Japanese in the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya.|$|E
5000|$|A common quirk with wordfilters, often {{considered}} either comical or <b>aggravating</b> <b>by</b> users, {{is that they}} often affect words that are {{not intended to be}} filtered. This is a typical problem when short words are filtered. For example, one may see, [...] "Do you need istance for playing clical music?" [...] Multiple words may be filtered if whitespace is ignored, resulting in [...] "as suspected" [...] becoming [...] " [...] uspected". Prohibiting a phrase such as [...] "hard on" [...] will result in filtering innocuous statements such as [...] "That was a hard one!" [...] and [...] "Sorry I was hard on you," [...] into [...] "That was a e!" [...] and [...] "Sorry I was you." ...|$|R

5|$|Edward II was a {{weak and}} ineffectual king (made {{to look the}} more so by {{comparison}} {{with his father and}} son, Edward I and Edward III), and his reign was marked by military failure and internal strife. A great number of the barony turned against the King, and the leader of the opposition eventually became Thomas of Lancaster. Lancaster was Edward's cousin, and next to the King he was the richest man in the country. Through a set of regulations known as the Ordinances, Lancaster and his associates had been trying to put restrictions on royal authority, but by the late 1310s Edward was again in full control of central government. The situation was <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> the King's ostentatious patronage of his favourite, Hugh Despenser, and Hugh's father by the same name.|$|E
5|$|The Levels were {{frequently}} flooded {{by the sea}} during high tides, a problem that was not resolved until the sea defences were enhanced in the early 20thcentury. In addition, the problems of high fresh water floods are <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> the unrestricted entry of the tide along the Parrett, {{which is the only}} river in the Levels and Moors that does not have a clyse on it. Discussions on whether a clyse is needed for the Parrett and whether it should be sited at Bridgwater or nearer the mouth of the river date back to 1939, at the start of World War II, and have not been resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Red River had {{a history}} of {{seasonal}} flooding, <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> the broad ancient lake bed that formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from the bulk of the flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E

6000|$|Aggravate for Irritate. [...] "He <b>{{aggravate}}d</b> me <b>by</b> his insolence."

5|$|The {{situation}} {{most likely}} degenerated in 1904, {{after the death}} of his aunt Lenci, when Ion Luca took over his son's inheritance, and <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> his father's decision to cease subsidizing him, which left the latter without a stable source of income. He was thus supposed to provide for his mother and sister, until Ion Luca transferred the inheritance resulting from the death of his other aunt Catinca Momuloaia, to his former lover. He also indicated that his father had made him attend the Frederick William University without advancing money for tuition. Some time after returning to Romania, he began attending the Symbolist literary circle formed around the poet and leftist political agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, who provided the young Caragiale with money and often invited him to supper.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was further <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> {{the absence of}} a clear successor, made more pressing because of Nerva's old age and sickness. He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives, who were unsuited for political office. A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that, by 97, Nerva was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, the powerful governor of Syria. This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus Ulpius Traianus, commonly known as Trajan, a general of the armies at the German frontier.|$|E
5|$|Vladimir Lenin {{was voted}} the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR (Sovnarkom) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets. His health, {{at the age}} of 53, {{declined}} from effects of two bullet wounds, later <b>aggravated</b> <b>by</b> three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924. Irrespective of his health status in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to Stalin. Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom, and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country, the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s. By the end of the decade, Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo.|$|E
