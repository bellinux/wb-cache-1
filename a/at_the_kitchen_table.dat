25|$|Each episode {{follows the}} same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair {{would get into}} bed but in recent seasons they sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually {{insulting}} him. This leads Podge on to telling a story (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.|$|E
500|$|David has {{appeared}} in fictional form at least twice. In 2000 a novel, Lunch with Elizabeth David by Roger Williams, was published by Carroll & Graf, and in 2006 the BBC broadcast , a film starring Catherine McCormack as David and Greg Wise as Peter Higgins. In 1998 Lisa Chaney published a biography of David; the journalist Paul Levy found it [...] "hasty, botched", although in The New York Times Laura Shapiro considered it [...] "comprehensive". The following year an authorised biography, Writing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>Table,</b> was published by Artemis Cooper. She also wrote the entry for David in the Dictionary of National Biography in 2004 (updated in 2011). David's papers are at the Schlesinger Library at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University.|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), {{was sitting}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> {{when she and}} Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting. He {{then returned to the}} kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

He leaves the family a box of old silver dollars that they decide to spend at the mall right away. At the mall, Lisa sees the new talking Malibu Stacy doll in a toy store.

2500|$|Reuben Mattus {{invented the}} [...] "Häagen-Dazs" [...] name {{supposedly}} {{as a tribute}} to Denmark's exemplary treatment of its Jews during the Second World War, and included an outline map of Denmark on early labels. [...] Mattus claimed the name was [...] "Danish-sounding," [...] although it is not Danish, which has neither an umlaut ä (rather, the ligature æ is the corresponding counterpart) nor a digraph zs, nor did the name have any meaning in any language before its creation. (The surname Haagen, without an umlaut, does exist in Denmark.) Mattus felt that Denmark was known for its dairy products and had a positive image in the United States. His daughter Doris Hurley reported in the 1999 PBS documentary An Ice Cream Show that her father sat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> for hours saying nonsensical words until he came up with a combination he liked. The reason he chose this method was so that the name would be unique and original.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Scottish {{housewife}} Valerie Hunter Gordon started {{developing and}} making Paddi, a 2-part system {{consisting of a}} disposable pad (made of cellulose wadding covered with cotton wool) worn inside an adjustable plastic garment with press-studs/snaps. Initially, she used old parachutes for the garment. She applied for the patent in April 1948, and it was granted for the UK in October 1949. [...] Initially, the big manufacturers were unable to see the commercial possibilities of disposable nappies. In 1948, Gordon made over 400 Paddis herself using her sewing machine <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> Her husband had unsuccessfully approached several companies for help until {{he had a chance}} meeting with Sir Robert Robinson at a business dinner. In November 1949 Valerie Gordon signed a contract with Robinsons of Chesterfield who then went into full production. In 1950, Boots UK agreed to sell Paddi in all their branches. In 1951 the Paddi patent was granted for the USA and worldwide. Shortly after that, Playtex and several other large international companies tried unsuccessfully to buy out Paddi from Robinsons. Paddi was very successful for many years until the advent of 'all in one' diapers.|$|E

It was recorded in New York City at Sound Ideas recording studios [...] In 1980, Vincent moved to Los Angeles, California where he became a staff songwriter for the television series Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi. Many of the series songs were written on Vincent's acoustic guitar while sitting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cunninghams' <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> on <b>the</b> Happy Days set, during off-time from the show's rehearsal schedule.

40|$|The {{story behind}} this {{research}} project begins in 1962 when, at age 11, I developed {{an eating disorder}} and began to keep a diary. The themes and threads that bind the story together, however, began to weave a pattern {{almost as soon as}} I was born. In early childhood, the world through my eyes comprised a small, beautiful valley adjoining the Mitchell River National Park in Victoria, Australia. I lived on a dairy farm with my parents and sister. For my first 11 years, my home had no electricity, television or Internet, but my days were full. The farm, river and adjacent bushland provided a natural outdoors playground, seeding my imagination. Indoors, on rainy days and at night by lantern-light, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> solid oak <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> I would ask my mother for pen and paper and write a note or two about my day. A friendship with words was already taking hold. Associated Grant:RTP; RT...|$|R

The room seemed to expand and then grow smaller, the figure of Jane to sway backwards and forwards before him.
