25|$|On 16 January 2007, {{this series}} had {{attracted}} {{the largest ever}} number of public complaints to the UK broadcasting watchdog Ofcom about <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Brother</b> series. The complaints received detailed concerns that housemate Shilpa Shetty had been subjected to bullying. Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara's behaviour towards Shetty sparked widespread anger and demonstrations in India, where the alleged racism was reported on the news, and led Big Brothers main sponsor Carphone Warehouse to suspend its sponsorship of the show. As of 19 January 2007, a Channel 4 spokesman agreed that participants should {{be made aware of}} the controversy, which would probably explain the subsequent statements and apologies tendered by the housemates and their complete lack of surprise after learning about the latest eviction.|$|E
25|$|In episode 2, Kat and Alfie {{are invited}} to Lance's wake by Peter, and when {{speaking}} to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kat realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kat gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains {{she did not know}} she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks if he has <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>brother.</b> Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Rois√≠n Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} and world designs were handled by art director Kentaro Kagami, and artist and graphics designer Masashi Nakagawa. Leanne {{was the first}} character to be envisioned, before most of the game's concepts had been finalized. The second was Zephyr, who was nicknamed [...] "Boy of the Demonic Possession". The third was Vashyron, who was dubbed [...] "ultimate gentleman". While originally conceived as a [...] "glistening" [...] character, he was reworked as <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>brother</b> figure, which in turn led to the scene where he and Zephyr first fight. Rowen's early artwork depict his position as an authority figure {{looking down on the}} world from the Zenith System. According to Kagami, his character artwork was created in consultation with Norimoto and Suguro. The three main characters went through multiple design revisions. While Zephyr and Vashyron were designed to reflect the grim environment of Basel, Leanne was meant to contrast against them. Zephyr was initially a lighter, less antagonistic character due to him being younger than Leanne. Unlike other characters, Vashyron's design went through a fairly smooth development process, with his clothing remaining consistent through the design phase. Leanne's clothing {{took a long time to}} finalize: earlier versions of her were based on a concept of her being fashion conscious, but this made her look odd next to the other characters. The small cast was something decided upon at an early stage, along with adjusting the male characters to appear less feminine than others from Japanese RPGs. The latter change was made with a Western audience in mind.|$|E
500|$|After {{the divorce}} became final in 1976, the children, then aged 12 and 9, {{returned}} {{to live with}} their mother, who was director of nursing at a Montreal hospital. [...] In 1977, the family moved to a house purchased in the middle-class Montreal suburb of Pierrefonds. Gamil Gharbi attended junior high and high school, where he was described as a quiet student who obtained average to above average marks. He developed a close friendship with another boy, but he did not fit in with other students. [...] Taunted as an Arab because of his name, at the age of 14 he legally changed it to [...] "Marc L√©pine", citing his hatred of his father as the reason for taking his mother's surname. L√©pine was uncommunicative and showed little emotion. He suffered from low self-esteem, exacerbated by his chronic acne. [...] Family relations remained difficult; his younger sister Nadia publicly humiliated him about his acne and his lack of girlfriends. He fantasized about her death, and on one occasion made a mock grave for her. [...] He was overjoyed when in 1981 she was placed in a group home because of her delinquent behaviour and drug abuse. Seeking a good male role model for L√©pine, his mother arranged for <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Brother.</b> For two years, the experience proved positive as L√©pine, often with his best friend, enjoyed the time with photography and moto-cross motorcycles. However, in 1979 the meetings ceased abruptly when the Big Brother was detained on suspicion of molesting young boys. Both L√©pine and his Big Brother denied that any molestation had occurred. L√©pine owned an air rifle as a teenager, which he used to shoot pigeons near his home with his friend. [...] They also enjoyed designing and building electronic gadgets. [...] He developed an interest in World War II and an admiration of Adolf Hitler, and enjoyed action and horror movies. [...] L√©pine also took considerable responsibility at home, including cleaning and doing repairs while his mother worked.|$|E
