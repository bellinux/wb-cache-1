5000|$|Tawny frogmouths have a {{wide range}} of vocalisations that can signal {{information}} about sex, territory, food, or predators. They generally use low amplitude and low frequency sounds to communicate though some of their warning screams can be heard for miles. Nestlings make a number of unique calls expressing distress, hunger, and fear. Juveniles retain this range while developing a loud call for begging. Nestlings, juveniles, and adults all use a low amplitude <b>annoyance</b> <b>call</b> meant for family members. [...] When disturbed during rest, tawny frogmouths can emit a soft warning buzz that sounds similar to a bee and when threatened, they can make a loud hissing noise and produce clacking sounds with their bill.|$|E
50|$|The gold box can be {{considered}} a hardware version of a diverter, which is a fixed form of call forwarding. However, while the diverter is a service offered to customers by the telephone company, the Gold Box is usually installed illegally and used to place long distance or <b>annoyance</b> <b>calls</b> at the expense (and liability) of the owner of the affected lines.|$|R
50|$|Snowy owl {{calls are}} varied, but the alarm call is a barking, almost quacking krek-krek; the female {{also has a}} softer mewling pyee-pyee or prek-prek. The song is a deep {{repeated}} gahw. They may also clap their beak in response to threats or <b>annoyances.</b> While <b>called</b> clapping, it is believed this sound may actually be a clicking of the tongue, not the beak.|$|R
5000|$|Messing {{was cited}} as “Best Improviser” in the Chicago Reader's 2008 Best Of Chicago issue, and is {{currently}} running a show at The <b>Annoyance</b> Theater <b>called</b> Messing with a Friend. The evening includes guests improvisers from the iO Theater, Second City, and The Annoyance Theater. In a favorable review, Ryan Hubbard of the Chicago Reader wrote that her skill improvising with others, [...] "…is a testament to her congeniality, experience, and broad intelligence." [...] She {{can also be seen}} improvising in the shows Molly alongside Second City director Norm Holly at iO every Tuesday night and The Boys alongside Rachael Mason, Norm Holly, Ryan Archibald, and Craig Uhlir at The Second City on every Friday night.|$|R
50|$|Subaru has {{black hair}} that is styled to the side, {{as noted by}} Komomo that he looks more {{youthful}} when his hair is not styled. Due to his cool composure, tall stature, and manly appearance, many women and Cain swoon over him, though he only has eyes for Komomo. Chiruha thinks that he is handsome because {{he looks like a}} king from a TV show, much to Kisara's <b>annoyance</b> because she <b>called</b> him cute rather than handsome, resulting in Chiruha whole-heartedly assuring him that he is beautiful.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the authors}} use both SUIF and LUIF in [8]. We argue that CAC decisions {{should not be}} based on SUIF, especially when taking pricing into account (which [8] does not). As it will be explained {{in the rest of}} this section in more detail, our view is that unnecessary degradation of users should not be implemented if there is no revenue gain; however, the provider cannot ignore a profitable policy to avoid an increase in the user’s SUIF. This argument is supported by the well-known fact that in wireless networks call dropping creates significantly larger user <b>annoyance</b> than <b>call</b> blocking, i.e., users are more irritated when their ongoing call ends or has a very poor quality than they are when they do not manage to initiate a call. For this reason, and especially in the case that call blocking can lead to a revenue increase, a provider should not take SUIF into account for call admission control decisions, whereas SUIF should be taken into account for medium access control decisions (associated with call dropping). We incorporate SUIF in our MAC scheme presented in “The proposed MAC scheme”.|$|R
60|$|A {{thing that}} one feels {{more and more}} irritatingly in England is that, while with other foreigners we stand on common ground, where we may be as unlike them as we choose, with the English we always stand on English ground, where we can differ only at our peril, and to our disadvantage. A person {{speaking}} English and bearing an English name, had better be English, for if he cannot it shows, it proves, {{that there is something}} wrong in him. Our misfortune is that our tradition, and perhaps our inclination, obliges us to be un-English, whereas we do not trouble ourselves to be un-French, or un-Italian, for we are so by nature. The effort involved in distinguishing ourselves breeds a sort of <b>annoyance,</b> or <b>call</b> it no more than uneasiness, which is almost as bad as a bad conscience; and in our sense of hopeless perdition we turn vindictively upon our judge. But that is not fair and it is not wise; he does not mean to be our judge, except when he comes to us for the purpose; in his own house, he is civilly unaware of putting us to any test whatever. If you ask him whether he likes this thing or that of ours, he will tell you frankly; he never can see why he should not be frank; he has a kind of helplessness in always speaking the truth; and he does not try to make it palatable.|$|R
2500|$|Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell {{was billed}} as Ali's toughest {{opponent}} since Liston—unbeaten in five years and having defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced. Terrell was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali [...] "Clay", much to Ali's <b>annoyance</b> (Ali <b>called</b> Cassius Clay his [...] "slave name"). The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. [...] "I want to torture him", he said. [...] "A clean knockout is too good for him." [...] The fight was close until the seventh round when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, [...] "What's my name, Uncle Tom... what's my name?" [...] Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye—forcing Terrell to fight half-blind—and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali's apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as [...] "one of the ugliest boxing fights". Tex Maule later wrote: [...] "It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty." [...] Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali's critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.|$|R

6000|$|The last {{annoyance}} {{that has}} assailed {{me is the}} <b>annoyance</b> of being <b>called</b> upon to write this Narrative. Is a man in my state of nervous wretchedness capable of writing narratives? When I put this extremely reasonable objection, I am told that certain very serious events relating to my niece have happened within my experience, and that I am the fit person to describe them on that account. I am threatened if I fail to exert myself in the manner required, with consequences which I cannot so much as think of without perfect prostration. There is really no need to threaten me. Shattered by my miserable health and my family troubles, I am incapable of resistance. If you insist, you take your unjust advantage of me, and I give way immediately. I will endeavour to remember what I can (under protest), and to write what I can (also under protest), and what I can't remember and can't write, Louis must remember and write for me. He is an ass, and I am an invalid, and {{we are likely to}} make all sorts of mistakes between us. How humiliating! ...|$|R
40|$|During {{the process}} of European {{integration}} the question arose how a standard could be created to assess qualitative and quantitative effects deriving from the development of transport infrastructures. The issue gets an even higher emphasis in case of valuation the development of large projects which impact several countries. The main {{aim of the research}} was to determine how much people are bothered, disturbed or annoyed by noise, and then to establish a correlation between this and their willingness to pay, and the absolute noise levels. This paper summarizes the survey and its results. Noise influences people´s well being and standard of living. It is the only environmental pollution where it is not a polluting material that effects the body adversely - {{as it is in the}} case of air or water pollution -, but the danger is created by an energy overdose reaching the sensory and data processing organs. Here we talk about nervous processes and this characteristic distinguishes noise pollution from all the other contaminating factors. It has also got to be mentioned that perceiving noise is very subjective. The reaction of people is largely predetermined by how they relate to the noise source. Noise annoyance can be determined by socio-acoustical studies. The essence of these is that they do not only take into account decibel levels, but attach so <b>called</b> <b>annoyance</b> levels to the given sound pressure levels...|$|R
