25|$|As American {{political}} strategists {{turn their}} attention to the 2016 presidential contest, they identify Facebook as an increasingly important advertising tool. Recent technical innovations have made possible more advanced divisions and subdivisions of the electorate. Most important, Facebook can now deliver video <b>ads</b> <b>to</b> small, highly targeted subsets. Television, by contrast, shows the same commercials to all viewers, and so cannot be precisely tailored.|$|E

In the 20th century, smoking came to be viewed in a decidedly negative light, especially in Western countries. This is due to smoking tobacco being among the leading causes of many diseases such as lung cancer, heart attack, COPD, erectile dysfunction, and birth defects. The health hazards of smoking have caused many countries to institute high taxes on tobacco products, run <b>ads</b> <b>to</b> discourage use, limit ads that promote use, and provide help with quitting for those who do smoke.|$|E

The ads suggest that Russian operatives worked off of evolving lists of racial, religious, political and economic themes. They used these to create pages, write posts and craft ads that would appear in user’s news feeds—with the apparent goal of appealing to one audience and alienating another.

[...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a [...] "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a [...] "Yes".

The conservative wing of the party, which had never trusted her husband, had the same reaction to her. [...] The largely male press corps tended to deal with her in a paternalistic way, and she was often identified as [...] "Mrs. George Romney" [...] in stories and photo captions.
