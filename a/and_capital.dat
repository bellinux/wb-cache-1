5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains <b>and</b> <b>capital</b> losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, <b>and</b> <b>capital</b> controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I develop {{frameworks}} {{and models}} capturing {{the effects of}} marketing <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> on firm growth and sustained membership in the Fortune 500 cohort. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and industrial organization theories, in the first essay, I develop hypotheses on the relationships among a firm's marketing <b>capital,</b> R <b>and</b> D <b>capital,</b> key firm-specific <b>and</b> industry-specific factors and survival as a Fortune 500 firm. I test these hypotheses using a proportional hazard model on a uniquely compiled large panel data set of manufacturing Fortune 500 firms over a 25 -year period. The results show that while both marketing and R <b>and</b> D <b>capitals</b> have significant <b>and</b> direct positive associations with survival as a Fortune 500 firm, the moderating effects of industry growth on the relationships between marketing <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> survival as a Fortune 500 firm and between R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> survival as a Fortune 500 firm is asymmetric. It is positive for marketing capital but negative for R <b>and</b> D <b>capital.</b> Thus, to retain firms? position on the Fortune 500 list, managers {{may want to consider}} investing more in marketing (R and D) when industry growth is high (low). In the second essay, I examine the effect of advertising <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> R <b>and</b> D <b>capital,</b> their complementarities, <b>and</b> their interactions with the environmental contingency factors of dynamism, munificence, and complexity on sales growth, profit growth, and market value growth. Using dynamic panel data analysis of 185 firms over an eight year period (2000 - 2007), I uncover a nuanced understanding of how advertising and R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> affect these performance measures. My results show that both R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> advertising <b>capital</b> directly affect sales growth, but neither has a direct impact on profit growth. Furthermore, R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> has a direct impact on market value growth. I also find that while the interaction of advertising <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> R <b>and</b> D <b>capital</b> does not directly affect sales growth or market value growth, it has a positive direct impact on profit growth. Finally, I find that environmental contingencies matter. For instance, environmental dynamism negatively (positively) moderates the relationship between R <b>and</b> D (advertising) <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> sales growth...|$|R
