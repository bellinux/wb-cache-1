40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the information needs and reported adherence of patients prescribed medicines for chronic conditions in those who have received a community pharmacy <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> {{and those who have}} not. Methods: A questionnaire was constructed using validated tools to measure medication information satisfaction and adherence together with questions eliciting information regarding the use of pharmacy services and demographic characteristics. This questionaire was distributed from four community pharmacies to a convenience sample of 400 patients as they collected their medicines. Patients were eligible if prescribed more than one regular medicine and attending the pharmacy for longer than three months. The questionnaire was returned directly to the university. Key Findings: 232 (58 %) questionnaires were returned. All respondents desired further information about their prescribed medicines, particularly about potential medication problems. Dissatisfaction centred on side effects, interactions and certain medicine characteristics such as {{how long it will take}} to act. Satisfaction with information about medicines and adherence were significantly greater in a subgroup reporting that they had received an <b>advanced</b> pharmacy <b>service</b> e. g. medicine use review. Conclusion: Patients who had received an <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> reported greater adherence and satisfaction with medicine related information. This was a small, observational study, using a convenience sample of four pharmacies; in order to draw definitive conclusions, a larger study with participants randomised to receive an <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> is required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the seamless service access with specific focus on roaming of <b>advanced</b> telecom <b>services.</b> Telecom networks provide voice and data connectivity in other countries, but <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> roaming as e. g. location {{is not yet}} in place. The contribution of this paper consists in analyzing {{the current status of}} location roaming as an example of <b>advanced</b> telecom <b>services.</b> It highlights the complexity of location services, indicates both technical and sociological challenges for this type of service, and proposes WSMO based semantic annotations as a possible way of overcoming existing limitations. Finally, we show how our proposal is applied to a real use case – seamless access to the Orange and Telenor location services...|$|R

In this work, we show how the JXTA Peer-to-Peer networking infrastructure can be extended and integrated with current technologies for <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> discovery and interaction: The DAML-S service ontology for service description, WSDL for interface descriptions, and SOAP for remote invocation. Our approach allows platform-independent interaction between devices represented by JXTA peers, and the ability to describe services with rich semantic information to enable <b>advanced</b> <b>service</b> discovery. The inference engine JTP (Java Theorem Prover) is used to reason about (evaluate) services. We have demonstrated our work by providing a simpl...|$|R
40|$|Service {{operations}} are currently at {{the hub of}} economic activities {{in some parts of}} the world. Although indicators seem to suggest the existence and future dominance of service economies, such economies will only be sustainable if appropriate use of scientific and engineering methods are applied to the complete spectrum of service operations; i. e. the engineering aspects and the business side (management) of operating systems. The challenge, therefore, lies in selecting appropriate scientific and engineering tools, techniques, methods and technologies for implementation in those critical areas that can leverage dynamics in service operations as they are known today. Of all engineering disciplines currently available today, industrial engineering and its related equivalence or variants is among the most multifaceted disciplines that can face up to the challenge of <b>advancing</b> <b>service</b> operations to higher dimensions. Such advancement requires appropriate demonstrable, practical and transferable research results as well as suitable case studies on service operations. In light of the quest to <b>advance</b> <b>service</b> operations, this paper discusses the changing roles of industrial engineering and its crucial input in <b>advancing</b> <b>service</b> operations towards growth, development and perhaps global dominance of service economies...|$|R
