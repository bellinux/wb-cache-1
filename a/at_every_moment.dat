It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor.

A specific example of this problem is hunting for an enemy submarine by naval forces. So far, this problem has not been solved, because of the difficulty of predicting the target's behaviour. In finding promising routes for the search units, a heuristic has been developed.

25|$|Identification {{of major}} forces is {{critical}} to understanding insect flight. The first attempts to understand flapping wings assumed a quasi-steady state. This means that the air flow over the wing {{at any given time}} was assumed to be the same as how the flow would be over a non-flapping, steady-state wing at the same angle of attack. By dividing the flapping wing into a large number of motionless positions and then analyzing each position, {{it would be possible to}} create a timeline of the instantaneous forces on the wing <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>moment.</b> The calculated lift was found to be too small by a factor of three, so researchers realized that there must be unsteady phenomena providing aerodynamic forces. There were several developing analytical models attempting to approximate flow close to a flapping wing. Some researchers predicted force peaks at supination. With a dynamically scaled model of a fruit fly, these predicted forces later were confirmed. Others argued that the force peaks during supination and pronation are caused by an unknown rotational effect that fundamentally is different from the translational phenomena. There is some disagreement with this argument. Through computational fluid dynamics, some researchers argue that there is no rotational effect. They claim that the high forces are caused by an interaction with the wake shed by the previous stroke.|$|E

2500|$|In Bell's {{version of}} the thought experiment, three spaceships A, B and C are {{initially}} at rest in a common inertial reference frame, B and C being equidistant to A. Then, a signal is sent from A to reach B and C simultaneously, causing B and C starting to accelerate in the vertical direction (having been pre-programmed with identical acceleration profiles), while A stays at rest in its original reference frame. According to Bell, this implies that B and C (as seen in A's rest frame) [...] "will have <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> the same velocity, and so remain displaced {{one from the other}} by a fixed distance." [...] Now, if a fragile thread is tied between B and C, it's not long enough anymore due to length contractions, thus it will break. He concluded that [...] "the artificial prevention of the natural contraction imposes intolerable stress".|$|E
2500|$|Opponents also {{charge the}} B-theory with {{being unable to}} explain {{persistence}} of objects. The two leading explanations for this phenomenon are endurantism and perdurantism. The former states that an object is wholly present <b>at</b> <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> of its existence. The latter states that objects are extended in time and therefore have temporal parts. Hales and Johnson explain endurantism as follows: [...] "something is an enduring object {{only if it is}} wholly present at each time in which it exists. An object is wholly present at a time if all of its parts co-exist at that time." [...] Under endurantism, all objects must exist as wholes at each point in time. However, an object such as a rotting fruit will have the property of being not rotten one day and being rotten on another. On eternalism, and hence the B-theory, it seems that one is committed to two conflicting states for the same object. The spacetime (Minkowskian) interpretation of relativity adds an additional problem for endurantism under the B-theory. On the spacetime interpretation, an object may appear as a whole at its rest frame. On an inertial frame, however, that same object will have proper parts at different positions, and therefore will have different parts at different times. Hence, it will not exist as a whole at any point in time, contradicting the thesis of endurantism.|$|E
