2500|$|Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves (Diane Holland) Dancing Instructress – Yvonne {{was born}} in Southport in 1914, the {{daughter}} of a floor-walker at the Waring & Gillow Department Store. Yvonne was very supercilious and believed she was socially above all other members of the entertainment staff, with the exception of Jeffrey Fairbrother and Clive Dempster. It is questionable why she actually worked at Maplins, as she believed it to be a [...] "dreadful, common place". It is assumed that she behaved in this way to hide a somewhat promiscuous youth. Because of her snobbish personality, she was disliked by many of her colleagues, Ted in particular. She met Barry when they were staying in digs together in Sunderland, but after a brief affair she became involved with a Hungarian acrobat from the Magyar Trio and became pregnant. When he found out he left her and joined ENSA. She then returned to Barry and he agreed to marry her, taking her home to be looked after by his family. It is not known what happened to the child. Barry and Yvonne later became professional ballroom dancers. During World War II Yvonne worked as an <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>nurse</b> in a military hospital, and it was during this time that she met Julian Dalrymple-Sykes, and there is a suggestion that they had an affair. In 1942 Yvonne and Barry became ballroom champions, winning many trophies for their performances, although Ted believed they became champions only because of the reduced ranks of the opposition owing to most of the men being away fighting. Yvonne's and Barry's careers took a downturn after the war and in 1956 they were forced to join Maplins as dancing instructors. She always tried to keep her dignity and high-class values while at Maplins, but this was not made easy when she was forced to participate in the entertainment events. Yvonne disliked most of the entertainment staff, Ted Bovis and Mr Partridge in particular. She referred to Ted's money-making schemes as [...] "petty", although she and Barry ran their own scheme selling cheap dancing shoes to campers for high prices. She was left heartbroken after Barry abandoned her for unknown reasons during the 1960 season, but she quickly recovered when Julian Dalrymple-Sykes arrived to replace Barry. She rekindled her relationship with Julian during the remainder of the season, but she never allowed him to become too close. After the end of the 1960 season they went travelling to dance in famous places across the world.|$|E

After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, {{there were a}} number of changes in health legislation. This work provides a comprehensive view of the development and current situation of health care assistants, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses,</b> nurses and health care workers. The objectives of this work were to compare the development of individual professions, the concept of education, the possibilities of lifelong learning and professional association. The aim of the work was also to describe the actual performances, performed by <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing</b> staff and the legal requirements for the competencies of these professions. Through the form of a questionnaire survey, a survey was carried out between the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nursing</b> staff in both countries, which showed that there was a significant overrun of competencies in both Slovak and Czech respondents. The provision of high-quality nursing care is currently highlighted. An important factor in providing quality and safe care is the proper division of tasks between nursing team members and the pursuit of a profession in accordance with legally defined competencies. keywords: Regulation of profession, health-care profession, <b>nursing,</b> health-care assistent, <b>auxiliary</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the quality and}} quantity of the oral health care training in the education of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> in Norway. Material and methods: An e-mail-administered questionnaire was sent to all 164 high schools in Norway offering basic education for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> in the academic year 2011 / 2012. The questionnaire collected information on the theoretical and practical oral care education, teaching material, curriculum and the school’s opinion of the core curriculum from the government, the students’ interest in the subject, and the schools’ self-assessment of their oral care training program. Results: Of the 114 schools responding to the survey (69. 5 % response rate), 56 (49. 1 %) offered three hours or more teaching in oral health care. 39 (34. 2 %) stated that the students are not well enough prepared for later work in health care. Important elements as working techniques, interdental brushes and electrical powered toothbrushes were included in few of the schools. Only 12 (10. 5 %) stated that the core curriculum from the government is good enough. Conclusions: The oral care teaching program for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> seems inadequate.

40|$|Background. The {{performance}} of midlevel health workers {{is a critical}} lever for strengthening health systems and redressing inequalities in underserved areas. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> form the largest cadre of health workers in Guatemala. In rural settings, they provide essential services to vulnerable communities, and thus have great potential to address priority health needs. This paper examines auxiliary nurses' motivation and satisfaction, and the coping strategies they use to respond to challenges they confront in their practice. Methods. Semistructured {{interviews were conducted with}} 14 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> delivering health services in Alta Verapaz, Guatemala. Results. Community connectedness was central to motivation in this rural Guatemalan setting. Participants were from rural communities and conveyed a sense of connection to the people they were serving through shared culture and their own experiences of health needs. Satisfaction was derived through recognition from the community and a sense of valuing their work. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> described challenges commonly faced in low-resource settings. Findings indicated they were actively confronting these challenges through their own initiative. Conclusions. Strategies to support the {{performance of}} midlevel health workers should focus on mechanisms to make training accessible to rural residents, support problem-solving in practice, and emphasize building relationships with communities served...|$|R

We have been performing semi-structured interviews on 9 people, on different levels in the elderly care. There were 3 elderly care managers, 1 nurse, 1 assistance administrator and 4 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses,</b> who all, at some level, work with alcohol problems in elderly people. Those interviews were performed singularly, with one exception: we interviewed an elderly care manager and her 2 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> at the same time. To analyse our empirics, we have used the theories of Power and Ageism. Our study shows that the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses,</b> who {{are the ones who}} must deal with these problems, have great difficulties to perform their work because they have no qualified knowledge about alcohol problems. In addition, they almost never get the proper information, they don’t have access to guidelines about handling people with alcohol problems and they don’t receive support from their superiors.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Previous {{research}} in performance appraisal (PA) indicates that variation exists in learning and job motivation from performance appraisal between occupational groups. This research evaluates the potential effect of job motivation, learning and self-assessment through performance appraisals for health personnel. Case description This {{article focuses on}} goal-setting, feedback, participation and training in performance appraisals in municipal health services in Norway; and job motivation, learning and self-assessment of performance are the dependent factors. Questionnaires were distributed to {{a representative sample of}} 600 health personnel from the Norwegian municipal health service, with a response rate of 62 %. Factor analysis and regression analysis were run in SPSS 12. Discussion and evaluation The study suggests that respondents learn from performance appraisal. Nurses experienced some higher job motivation from performance appraisal than <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses.</b> All subordinates perceived higher job motivation after performance appraisal than managers. Conclusion Useful feedback, active participation and higher education are fundamental elements of discussion in performance appraisal, as well as the role of increasing employees' job motivation. In this study, nurses' job motivation seems to be more effected by PA, than for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses.</b> Both <b>nurses</b> and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> indicate that there is a learning effect from PA. This study may be of interest to health researchers and managers in municipal health services. </p...|$|R

In a cross-sectional survey 200 <b>nurses,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>nurses</b> and midwifery staff were recruited to complete a questionnaire about their knowledge, attitude and practice towards standard isolation precautions in a teaching hospital in Yazd, Iran. the data were collected and analyzed using SPSS 14. the initial sample consisted of 230 participants, of whom 200 (87 %) responded to the distributed questionnaires. Knowledge and attitudes were moderate but their practice was relatively poor. Mean score of knowledge, attitude and practice towards standard isolation precautions were 11. 9 (Maximum = 16. 5), 27 (Maximum = 50), 4. 6 (Maximum = 9), respectively. Practice scores of women were significantly higher than men (P = 0. 028). The score of Knowledge increased significantly with age (P = 0. 004). A positive linear correlation was observed between knowledge and practice (P = 0. 01, correlation coefficient = 0. 173). this study revealed that there were serious defects in knowledge of health care workers regarding hand hygiene, disinfecting endoscopes, avoiding recapping needles and respiratory isolation precautions.
