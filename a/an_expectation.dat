5|$|Beginning {{with the}} surge in coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has steadily transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that coal would soon become scarce.

5|$|In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, {{insisted on}} retiring.

In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that the Foreign Secretary would {{be a member of}} the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be unacceptable to the Commons.|$|E
5|$|During his loan spell at Millwall, Doyle had {{suggested}} {{he might want}} to stay with the club on a permanent basis, despite the offer of a new contract from his parent club. However, {{at the end of the}} season he signed a two-year deal with Birmingham. Because Vaesen's contract had expired, there was <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that Doyle would step up to second-choice goalkeeper behind Maik Taylor. Doyle played his first competitive match for Birmingham in their League Cup first-round match against Shrewsbury Town on 22 August 2006, in which he kept a clean sheet as his club won 1–0. With Taylor injured, Doyle made his first league appearance for Birmingham four days later in a 2–0 defeat away to Cardiff City. Doyle played in the second and third rounds of the League Cup, against Wrexham and Sheffield United, before losing his place in the cup team to Taylor for the quarter-final defeat to Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to kickoff of the 2005game, {{the stadium}} {{announcer}} made an appeal for donations {{to help those}} suffering {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana fivedays previously. Donations were not accepted at the game because of a policy against official fund-raising. As the Longhorns entered the field, special teams player Karim Meijer carried a United States flag that was given to the team on Thursday by former Longhorn Nathan Kaspar who flew the flag during missions in southeastern Iraq. For this game only, the Longhorns wore throwback uniforms furnished by Nike as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963National Championship season under Coach Darrell K. Royal. Football's origins in the Northeastern United States have created <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that it is a cold-weather sport, but the temperature at kickoff was 90°F (32°C) which is also the average temperature in Austin for the month of September.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the physical presence of a name acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|The scale, and {{associated}} {{high number of}} casualties, of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead. Previous to World War I, individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers. However, the war required mobilisation of {{a significant percentage of}} the population, either as volunteers or through conscription. <b>An</b> <b>expectation</b> had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, even if they were low-ranking members of the military. A committee under Frederic Kenyon, Director of the British Museum, presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the cemeteries. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions. Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses, it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of brotherhood that had developed between serving ranks.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals Cardiff {{were drawn}} against Reading; the match was played at Molineux Stadium. Reading {{had reached the}} semi-final {{for the first time}} in their history. Additional trains were put on to bring Cardiff fans to Wolverhampton for the match, and there was <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that the game would set a new {{capacity}} record for the ground. Heavy rain had fallen before the match, resulting in a soft pitch. Reading appeared the stronger of the two teams at the start, but at 25 minutes Bert Eggo failed to clear the ball from the Reading penalty area and Ferguson pounced, scoring for Cardiff. This changed the match, which from then on was dominated by the Welsh. A further goal followed in the 35th minute from Harry Wake, sending Cardiff into half time two goals ahead. Reading pressed on initially during the second half, but Cardiff gradually regained domination of play, and Ferguson scored his second of the game in the 70th minute. Cardiff's fans began to celebrate early, believing that Reading could not come back from three goals down, which was the final result of the game.|$|E
5|$|The early {{development}} of solar technologies {{starting in the}} 1860s was driven by <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that coal would soon become scarce. Charles Fritts installed the world's first rooftop photovoltaic solar array, using 1%-efficient selenium cells, on a New York City roof in 1884. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum. In 1974 it was estimated that only six private homes in all of North America were entirely heated or cooled by functional solar power systems. The 1973 oil embargo and 1979 energy crisis caused a reorganization of energy policies around the world and brought renewed attention to developing solar technologies. Deployment strategies focused on incentive programs such as the Federal Photovoltaic Utilization Program in the US and the Sunshine Program in Japan. Other efforts included the formation of research facilities in the United States (SERI, now NREL), Japan (NEDO), and Germany (Fraunhofer–ISE). Between 1970 and 1983 installations of photovoltaic systems grew rapidly, but falling oil prices in the early 1980s moderated the growth of photovoltaics from 1984 to 1996.|$|E

5|$|The {{surge of}} German nationalism, {{stimulated by the}} {{experience}} of Germans in the Napoleonic period and initially allied with liberalism, shifted political, social, and cultural relationships within the German states. In this context, one can detect {{its roots in the}} experience of Germans in the Napoleonic period. The Burschenschaft student organizations and popular demonstrations, such as those held at Wartburg Castle in October 1817, contributed to a growing sense of unity among German speakers of Central Europe. Furthermore, implicit and sometimes explicit promises made during the War of Liberation engendered <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> of popular sovereignty and widespread participation in the political process, promises that largely went unfulfilled once peace had been achieved. Agitation by student organizations led such conservative leaders as Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich, to fear the rise of national sentiment; the assassination of German dramatist August von Kotzebue in March 1819 by a radical student seeking unification was followed on 20 September 1819 by the proclamation of the Carlsbad Decrees, which hampered intellectual leadership of the nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|In week thirteen, the Bears {{visited the}} Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome {{to play the}} Vikings, whom the Bears trailed 50–53–2 in the all-time series. Josh McCown was given the start for the third {{straight}} week, with <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> that Jay Cutler would return the following week. McCown entered the game having a 65.5 completion percentage for 1,106 yards, seven touchdowns, an interception, and a 100.8 passer rating. As a result, McCown had an advantage over the Vikings' pass defense, which ranked 29th in the league with 282 passing yards allowed, while also allowing quarterbacks to record a 65 completion percentage, 40 attempts per game, and a 97.7 passer rating. Also, the Vikings allowed 31.5 points per game, the worst in the NFL, while recording only 14 turnovers. However, the Bears' defense was a weakness, ranking last in rushing yards allowed per game (145.2), total yards (1,597) and first-downs allowed (89); the defense was 31st in the NFL in yards per carry (4.9), first-down percentage (27.1) and 20-plus yard runs (12). Additionally, the defense allowed running backs in the previous five games to rush for 999 yards, average 5.8 yards per carry, and 197 yards per game. Adrian Peterson ran for an average of 108 yards per game in his career against the Bears, including 120.6 in the last three meetings between the two. Minnesota's rushing game also ran for a year-best 232 yards in the previous week. Cutler, Lance Briggs, Major Wright, Anthony Walters, James Brown, Jonathan Scott, and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the Bears.|$|E
5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had <b>an</b> <b>expectation</b> to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary to take that step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

In determining a claim for an alleged breach of <b>a</b> legitimate <b>expectation,</b> <b>a</b> court will deliberate over three key considerations: (1) whether <b>a</b> legitimate <b>expectation</b> has arisen; (2) {{whether it would be}} unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and (3) if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person.|$|R
