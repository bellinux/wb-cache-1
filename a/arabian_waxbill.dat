50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>waxbill</b> (Estrilda rufibarba) is {{a highly}} sociable species of estrildid finch native to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 20,000 - 50,000 km2.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>waxbill</b> {{is usually}} found in wetter land of {{southern}} Tihamah foothills and the terraced slopes and wadis {{of the western}} escarpments in Yemen. It {{can also be found}} along the south coast of Yemen east to Wadi al-Jahr and, in the extensively irrigated intensive agricultural areas of Wadi Hadramawt between Shibam and Tarim, usually with a dense cover of trees and bushes. The altitude of its habitats is approximately 250 to 2,600 m.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSkin lipids play an {{important}} role in the regulation of cutaneous water loss (CWL). Earlier studies have shown that Saudi desert birds exhibit a tendency of reduced CWL than birds from temperate environment due to adaptive changes in composition of their skin lipids. In this study, we used thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for separation and detection of non-polar and polar lipids from the skin of six bird species including sooty gull, brown booby, house sparrow, <b>Arabian</b> <b>waxbill,</b> sand partridge, and laughing dove. The lipids were separated and detected on Silica gel G coated TLC plates and quantified by using densitometric image analysis. Rf values of the non-polar lipids were as follows: cholesterol (0. 29), free fatty acids (0. 58), triacylglycerol (0. 69), fatty acids methyl esters (0. 84) and cholesterol ester (0. 97). Rf values for the polar lipids were: cerebroside (0. 42), ceramide (0. 55) and cholesterol (0. 73). The results showed the abundance of fatty acids methyl esters (47. 75 – 60. 46 %) followed by triacylglycerol (12. 69 – 24. 14 %). The remaining lipid compositions were as follows: cholesterol (4. 09 – 13. 18 %), ceramide (2. 18 – 13. 27 %), and cerebroside (2. 53 – 12. 81 %). In conclusion, our findings showed that TLC is a simple and sensitive method for the separation and quantification of skin lipids. We also reported a new protocol for lipid extraction using the zirconia beads for efficient disruption of skin tissues. This study will help us better understand the role of skin lipids in adaptive physiology towards adverse climatic conditions...|$|E
