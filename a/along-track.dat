50|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} sonar (SAS) {{is a form}} of sonar {{in which}} sophisticated post-processing of sonar data are used in ways closely analogous to synthetic aperture radar. Synthetic aperture sonars combine a number of acoustic pings to form an image with much higher <b>along-track</b> resolution than conventional sonars. The <b>along-track</b> resolution can approach half the length of one sonar element, though is downward limited by 1/4 wavelength. The principle of synthetic aperture sonar is to move the sonar while illuminating the same spot on the sea floor with several pings. When moving along a straight line, those pings that have the image position within the beamwidth constitutes the synthetic array. By coherent reorganization of the data from all the pings, a synthetic aperture image is produced with improved <b>along-track</b> resolution. In contrast to conventional side-scan sonar, SAS processing provides range-independent <b>along-track</b> resolution. At maximum range the resolution can be magnitudes better than that of side-scan sonars.|$|E
50|$|CERES {{operates}} in three scanning modes: across the satellite ground track (cross-track), along {{the direction of}} the satellite ground track (<b>along-track),</b> and in a Rotating Azimuth Plane (RAP). In RAP mode, the radiometers scan in elevation as they rotate in azimuth, thus acquiring radiance measurement {{from a wide range of}} viewing angles. Until February 2005, on Terra and Aqua satellites one of CERES instruments scanned in cross-track mode while the other was in RAP or <b>along-track</b> mode. The instrument operating in RAP scanning mode took two days of <b>along-track</b> data every month. However the multi-angular CERES data allowed to derive new models which account for anisotropy of the viewed scene, and allow TOA radiative flux retrieval with enhanced precision.|$|E
5000|$|ATSR-1 (<b>Along-Track</b> Scanning Radiometer) is a 4 channel {{infrared}} radiometer and microwave sounder for measuring temperatures at the sea-surface {{and the top}} of clouds.|$|E
5000|$|Longitudinal {{performance}} implies navigation {{against a}} position along a track (e.g. 4-D control). However, {{at the present}} time, there are no navigation specifications requiring 4-D control, {{and there is no}} FTE in the longitudinal dimension. The current navigation specifications define requirements for <b>along-track</b> accuracy, which includes NSE and PDE. PDE is considered negligible. The <b>along-track</b> accuracy affects position reporting (e.g. [...] "10 NM to ABC") and procedure design (e.g. minimum segment altitudes where the aircraft can begin descent once crossing a fix).|$|E
50|$|Processed-image {{measurements}} {{showed that}} the synthetic aperture succeeded in producing resolution finer than 15 feet (5 meters) in the <b>along-track</b> direction, and occasionally half of that, the least possible with Quill’s 5-meter-long side-looking real antenna. Slant-range resolution was limited by {{the length of the}} transmitted pulses, and ground-range resolution was further limited by image foreshortening due to the obliquity of the images, the latter being about 5 times coarser than the <b>along-track</b> value, but values of those were not ones sought by this experiment.|$|E
5000|$|... some systems {{monitor the}} actual cross-track and <b>along-track</b> errors individually, whereas others monitor the radial NSE {{to simplify the}} {{monitoring}} and eliminate dependency on the aircraft track, e.g. based on typical elliptical 2-D error distributions.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the surface}} off-nadir clutter return, {{which can be}} {{confused}} with the subsurface echo with the same delay. To reduce the <b>along-track</b> clutter, a synthetic aperture is generated in the ground processing, thus narrowing the effective antenna footprint.|$|E
50|$|The side-looking antenna {{required}} for SAR operation was mounted nearly flush {{along one side}} of the Agena’s cylindrical body. In orbit, the body was rolled so that the beam was directed at a vertical angle of 55° from horizontal. From orbital altitudes varying around 130 nautical miles (nm), the beam illuminated the earth’s surface along a 10 nm-wide swath generally 160 nm distant and centered about 93 nm {{to the left of the}} vehicle’s ground track. The 0.006-radian-wide <b>along-track</b> beam illuminated 0.56 <b>along-track</b> nautical miles at a time, continuing to collect returns from each scene point while traveling that far along the earth’s surface, that much data per scene element to be collapsed (“focused”), during later signal processing, into a single measure (“image”) of the strength of return from that scene element.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of the ATSR series of space instruments is that it has, over a period of just over 15 years, undergone the transition from experimental sensor on the ERS satellites, developing the technique and demonstrating the accuracy that can be achieved with <b>along-track</b> scanning, to that of an operational system, within Europe’s Envisat and future GMES Programmes.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{innovative}} techniques {{using multiple}} receive apertures (‘Rx’) {{have been suggested}} to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional SAR to perform HRWS imaging. For optimum performance the relation between sensor velocity [...] and the <b>along-track</b> offsets [...] of the [...] sub-apertures has to result in equally spaced effective phase centers thus leading to a uniform sampling of the received signal. This requires that optimal PRF equals to.|$|E
50|$|Other {{exceptions}} are preserved photo prints of selected parts of three image strips. Digitally scanned copies of those prints {{are available in}} an NRO history document that is available on-line. However, those prints were at a scale which did not preserve either the fine <b>along-track</b> resolution or the coherence speckle effect that is observed in SAR images, both of which features were observable on the image films. In the absence of those films, all examples of Quill images having that resolution have been irretrievably lost.|$|E
5000|$|... {{characterizes the}} scene, while [...] is the azimuth impulse {{response}} of a single-aperture system, yieldingwhich gives the equivalent monostatic SAR signal. The functions [...] represent the channel between the transmitter (Tx) and each receiver (Rx [...] ) {{with respect to}} the monostatic impulse response, resulting in the respective multichannel SAR signal. Assuming a single transmitter and several receiver channels, the physical <b>along-track</b> distance between Rx [...] and [...] is given by Δx, while λ represents the carrier wavelength, [...] represents the slant range, and andrepresent the velocities of the sensor and the beam on ground, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Because it has {{following}} benefits: Multiple apertures {{that are}} displaced in <b>along-track</b> can acquire additional samples along the synthetic aperture and meanwhile they enable an efficient suppression of azimuth ambiguities. Moreover, by controlling a highly directive receiver beam following the radar pulse as it travels on the ground, multiple channels in elevation {{can improve the}} SNR (signal noise ratio) without reducing the swath width. Also, advanced multi-channel SAR architectures can avoid the use of separate Tx and Rx antennas and enable an increase of the coverage area without the necessity to either lengthen the antenna or employ burst modes.|$|E
50|$|To {{preserve}} return-signal strength, Quill’s {{range from}} its target areas had been minimized {{by using an}} unusually steep depression angle. The resulting images therefore had slant-range scales that were much foreshortened versions of the ground-range (mapping) scale of level terrain. While slant-range images provide a realistic perspective of terrain elevation variations, users of imagery usually prefer map-like images having nearly matching scales in both ground-range and <b>along-track</b> directions. Because the optical processor of that time {{did not have the}} capability to make full expansions to ground-range scale, only partially expanded images were made during processing of the original images.|$|E
5000|$|That led Leith, a {{physicist}} who was devising the correlator, {{to recognize that}} those effects in themselves could, by natural processes, perform {{a significant part of}} the needed processing, since <b>along-track</b> strips of the recording operated like diametrical slices of a series of circular optical zone plates. Any such plate performs somewhat like a lens, each plate having a specific focal length for any given wavelength. The recording that had been considered as scalar became recognized as pairs of opposite-sign vector ones of many spatial frequencies plus a zero-frequency [...] "bias" [...] quantity. The needed correlation summation changed from a pair of scalar ones to a single vector one.|$|E
50|$|A {{push broom}} scanner (also {{known as an}} <b>along-track</b> scanner) is a device for obtaining images with spectroscopic sensors. The {{scanners}} are regularly used for passive remote sensing from space, and in spectral analysis on production lines, for example with near-infrared spectroscopy used to identify contaminated food and feed. The moving scanner line in a traditional photocopier (or a scanner or facsimile machine) is also a familiar, everyday example of a push broom scanner. Push broom scanners and the variant whisk broom scanners (also known as across-track scanners) are often contrasted with staring arrays (such as found in a digital camera or phone), which images objects without scanning, and are more familiar to most people.|$|E
50|$|The dual-view {{measurements}} {{provided by}} the <b>along-track</b> scanning technique is also a key feature of AATSR when used for atmospheric or vegetation measurements. As with the SST measurements, the two measurements of each point on the surface through different atmospheric path lengths greatly simplifies the task of separating the surface and atmospheric contributions to the measured signal. Thus the effects of atmospheric aerosols can be removed from surface products (such as surface reflectance or NDVI). Conversely, a similar approach {{can be used to}} account for the surface reflectance in determining aerosol or cloud properties. Additionally, the parallax between the two views can be used to determine cloud top and aerosol plume heights using geometric means.|$|E
5000|$|A synthetic-aperture radar is an {{imaging radar}} {{mounted on a}} moving platform. Electromagnetic waves are {{sequentially}} transmitted, and reflected echoes are collected, digitized and stored by the radar antenna for later processing. As transmission and reception occur at different time, they map to different positions. The well ordered combination of the received signals builds a virtual aperture that is much longer than the physical antenna length. This {{is why it is}} named [...] "synthetic aperture", giving it the property of being an imaging radar. The range direction is parallel to flight track and perpendicular to azimuth direction, which is also known as <b>along-track</b> direction because it is in line with the position of the object within the antenna's field of view.|$|E
5000|$|On May 31, 2003 the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) in the ETM+ {{instrument}} failed. The SLC {{consists of}} a pair of small mirrors that rotate about an axis in tandem with the motion of the main ETM+ scan mirror. The purpose of the SLC is to compensate for the forward motion (<b>along-track)</b> of the spacecraft so that the resulting scans are aligned parallel to each other. Without the effects of the SLC, the instrument images the Earth in a [...] "zig-zag" [...] fashion, resulting in some areas that are imaged twice and others that are not imaged at all. The net effect is that approximately 22% of the data in a Landsat 7 scene is missing when acquired without a functional SLC.|$|E
50|$|Satellite and aerial {{monitoring}} {{through the}} use of planes, helicopter, or UAVs can provide a wider view and may be sufficient to monitor very large, low risk areas. These more sophisticated systems employ GPS and aircraft-mounted infrared or high-resolution visible cameras to identify and target wildfires. Satellite-mounted sensors such as Envisat's Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer and European Remote-Sensing Satellite's <b>Along-Track</b> Scanning Radiometer can measure infrared radiation emitted by fires, identifying hot spots greater than 39 C. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System combines remote-sensing data from satellite sources such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for detection of fire and smoke plume locations. However, satellite detection is prone to offset errors, anywhere from 2 to 3 km for MODIS and AVHRR data and up to 12 km for GOES data. Satellites in geostationary orbits may become disabled, and satellites in polar orbits are often limited by their short window of observation time. Cloud cover and image resolution and may also limit the effectiveness of satellite imagery.|$|E
50|$|The SWIR {{spectrometer}} {{was designed}} and built by the Optical Payloads Group of Surrey Satellites (SSTL); it employs an immersed grating design in which light impinges upon an etched grating from within a high-index substrate (silicon in this case). The reduced wavelength within the refractive medium permits an efficient, space-saving design. The SWIR grating was provided by SRON (Netherlands), who also provided the Front-End Electronics (FEE). The SWIR spectrometer receives light from the main instrument via an intermediate pupil, and directs this - via a telescope - towards a slit which defines the <b>along-track</b> footprint of the instrument on the ground. Light from the slit is re-collimated, diffracted by the immersed-grating at high-order and finally imaged onto a two-dimensional detector by a high aperture relay lens. The SWIR detector (furnished by Sofradir, France) has 256 elements in the across-track direction and 1024 elements in the spectral direction (the element pitch is 30 microns); it is operated cold (typically 140 K). The SWIR spectrometer optics are mounted on a cooled optical bench (approximately 200K) and the instrument is insulated by a multiple-layer insulation (MLI) blanket. The SWIR instrument was aligned, focussed and characterised at the Mullard Space Science laboratory thermal vacuum facility in Surrey, UK.|$|E
50|$|Objects {{in motion}} within a SAR scene alter the Doppler {{frequencies}} of the returns. Such objects therefore {{appear in the}} image at locations offset in the across-range direction by amounts proportional to the range-direction component of their velocity. Road vehicles may be depicted off the roadway and therefore not recognized as road traffic items. Trains appearing away from their tracks are more easily properly recognized by their length parallel to known trackage {{as well as by}} the absence of an equal length of railbed signature and of some adjacent terrain, both having been shadowed by the train. While images of moving vessels can be offset from the line of the earlier parts of their wakes, the more recent parts of the wake, which still partake of some of the vessel's motion, appear as curves connecting the vessel image to the relatively quiescent far-aft wake. In such identifiable cases, speed and direction of the moving items can be determined from the amounts of their offsets. The <b>along-track</b> component of a target's motion causes some defocus. Random motions such as that of wind-driven tree foliage, vehicles driven over rough terrain, or humans or other animals walking or running generally render those items not focusable, resulting in blurring or even effective invisibility.|$|E
50|$|Based on Ekman {{theory and}} geostrophic dynamics, the {{analysis}} of near-surface currents, i.e. tropical Pacific near-surface currents, can be generated by using high resolution data of wind and altimeter sea level. The surface velocity {{is defined as the}} motion of a standard World Ocean Circulation Experiment/Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere (WOCE/TOGA) 15m drogue drifter. Near-surface Ekman velocity can be estimated with variables which best represent the ageostrophic motion of the WOCE/TOGA 15m drogue drifters relative to the surface wind stress. Geostrophic velocities are calculated with sea level gradients which are derived from TOPEX/Poseidon sea surface height analyses (TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter sea level anomalies from <b>along-track</b> data is used here, interpolated to 1°X1°grid, spanning the domain of 25°N-25°S,90°E-290°E, during Oct1992-Sep1998). Geostrophic and Ekman velocity are assumed to satisfy the lowest-order dynamics of the surface velocity, and they can be obtained independently from surface height and wind stress data. Standard f plan satisfies geostrophic balance, the lowest-order balance for quasi-steady circulation at higher latitudes. However, coriolis parameter f is close to zero near the equator, the geostropic balance is not satisfied as the velocity is proportional to the height gradient divided by the coriolis parameter f. It has been shown in many studies that beta plane geostrophic approximation involving the second derivative of surface height is in good agreement with the observed velocities in the equatorial undercurrent, as a result, geostrophic currents which are near equator are obtained with a weighted blend of the equatorial beta-plane and conventional f-plane geostrophic equations.|$|E

Although data in Fig.  5 roughly follow expectations in the cross-track direction, <b>along-track</b> ion drifts are clustered at values much greater than zero. This suggests the offset in the Swarm data needs to be independently determined for the <b>along-track</b> and cross-track directions.|$|E

It is known that the neglection of across-track accelerations can bias the estimates of <b>along-track</b> velocities, but up to now it is unknown which vehicle accelerations appear in real traffic scenarios. On this account an experiment to measure accelerations was conducted. The measurement results, which are presented and discussed in this paper, imply that accelera-tions must not be neglected in the <b>along-track</b> velocity estimation step if accurate estimates are required. Finally, some basic ideas are given which enable a reliable separation of <b>along-track</b> velocity and across-track accelera-tion and so improve the estimation accuracy...|$|E
30|$|Both the <b>along-track</b> and cross-track {{components}} of the ion drift {{are expected to be}} zero at the low-latitude boundary of the convection zone. However, the offset is approximately 2000  m/s in the <b>along-track</b> direction and 600 – 1000  m/s in the cross-track direction. The difference in both magnitude and polarity suggests that offsets are considerably different in the <b>along-track</b> direction compared to the cross-track direction and therefore need to be determined separately.|$|E

30|$|Field {{difference}} {{data were}} not included in earlier CHAOS models; CHAOS- 6 is the first field model to be derived using <b>along-track</b> spatial differences of vector data from both CHAMP and Swarm. Figure  2 presents histograms of residuals for the vector field differences. Comparing Swarm <b>along-track</b> and east–west differences, the <b>along-track</b> differences (involving measurements made on the same orbit by the same instrument) have Huber-weighted rms misfits of 0.27, 0.27 and 0.34 nT for the radial, north–south and east–west components, compared with 0.47, 0.50 and 0.57 nT for the east–west vector field differences between Swarm Alpha and Charlie. Despite involving measurements from different satellites, we conclude the east–west vector field differences from Swarm are reliable and an internal field model is able to fit them to a weighted rms level of approximately 0.5 nT. Of course no east–west differences were possible with CHAMP, but we can compare the <b>along-track</b> differences. We find Huber-weighted rms misfits of 0.36, 0.36 and 0.40 nT for <b>along-track</b> differences of the radial, north–south and east–west vector field components from CHAMP. The <b>along-track</b> differences of Swarm vector data thus have generally smaller residuals than similar differences constructed with CHAMP data.

Six Ikonos images (four on one track and two on another track) were collected for a test site at Tampa Bay, Florida, in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Different combinations of Ikonos stereo image pairs, both <b>along-track</b> and cross-track, were formed. Using the high-resolution satellite image processing system developed at The Ohio State University, DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System) controlled ground control points, {{and a number of}} check points, we demonstrated: (a) The convergence angle {{plays an important role in}} <b>along-track</b> or cross-track stereo mapping, especially in improvement of the accuracy in the vertical direction; (b) Regardless of stereo configuration (<b>along-track</b> or cross-track), the accuracy in the X (cross-track) direction is better than that in the Y (<b>along-track)</b> direction; and (c) Although there is a slight correlation between the convergence angle and the accuracy in the Y (<b>along-track)</b> direction in the case of <b>along-track</b> stereo configuration, no distinct relationship is found in the X (cross-track) direction.
