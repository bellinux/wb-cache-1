5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to the state.|$|E
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed {{himself to the}} ropes to prevent a fall.

However the ropes had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing.

50|$|In 2003, a {{wildfire}} {{started in}} the park near Rattlesnake Island and spread quickly, eventually burning most of the park.

5|$|The {{procedure}} can {{be repeated}} if necessary, {{but this is}} generally taken as a clue that additional treatments {{may be required to}} control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by patients, and they present <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the patient's vision deteriorates rapidly.|$|E
5|$|This slow-moving but {{aggressive}} fish dominates feeding frenzies, and is <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to shipwreck or air crash survivors. Recent {{studies show}} steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued {{as the chief}} ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
50|$|The {{warning signal}} is their {{primary source of}} {{survival}} because it alerts the other prairie dogs to nearby danger. It can last for up to 30 minutes and can be heard nearly a mile away. <b>As</b> <b>danger</b> approaches, {{the intensity of the}} signal increases, and it ends after the prairie dog has entered its safe haven.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>danger</b> to {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|By January 1943, Himmler {{reported}} that 629,000 ethnic Germans had been resettled; however, most resettled Germans {{did not live}} in the envisioned small farms, but in temporary camps or quarters in towns. Half a million residents of the annexed Polish territories, {{as well as from}} Slovenia, Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg were deported to the General Government or sent to Germany as slave labour. Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to their German blood. In accordance with German racial laws, sexual relations between Germans and foreigners were forbidden as Rassenschande (race defilement).|$|E
5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> that learned helplessness can {{be the result of}} repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E

5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go {{all the way through the}} body. Gamma radiation can go all the way through the body.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in terms}} of fan base, the two fan bases are close in a way. Although the general public has held a {{stereotype}} of heavy metal fans being suicidal, depressed and <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to themselves and society in general. However, Adrian North, a Heriot-Watt University professor who studies genre listeners found that metal listeners were above all else creative, at ease with themselves and introverted — qualities he also found in classical listeners.|$|E
5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to her monarchical authority. Not without much hesitation and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, and carried it out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E
