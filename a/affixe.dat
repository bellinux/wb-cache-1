40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} in studying Indonesian as a foreign language ismastering the verb structure. This {{is due to the}} complexity of its affixation. A good and well-formed verb will ensure a good, formal, and acceptable sentence; on the contrary, a lack of <b>affixe</b> where it should be, will give a non-grammatical sentence. Indonesian verbs have two structures: simple and derived verbs...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} with {{a particular}} <b>affixe</b> (keter-/-an) consisting in two primary affixes. Through the analyse of terms coined by the Pusat Bahasa and spontaneous terms, the paper distinguishes between “double” and “complex” affixation, corresponding to different operating modes of affixation. The first deals with an already affixed and lexicalized word, then reaffixed and relexicalized. The second, almost only found in documents produced by the Pusat Bahasa, refers to a base getting a first affix in a poorly (or not) lexicalized form, constituting {{no more than a}} morphological stage towards the wished form, which is intent as lexicalized. Complex affix keter-R-an is basically a morphological calque and the author argues that it has been promoted and used during New Order on an ideological basis, as a mean to modernize Indonesian terminology by keeping its shape indigenous rather than by direct borrowing of English terms...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing theform of French linguistic units, which express non-singular meanings. It also attempts to explain the semantic marlrers employed to express such meanings. The data collection is done through observation using non-active participation and field notes. The data then is descriptively analyzed by classification. Themeanings of the non singular linguistic units can be grouped into 1) the non-singular meaning based on word category and word sub-category, 2) the non-singularmeaning based on numbers, J) the non-singular meaning based on the process, and 4) the semantic marlrerswhich express the non singular meanings. The result shows that the non-singular meanings only appear in pronouns and nouns. Based on the number. the non-singular meanings fall into finite and non-finite categories. They can also be classified as lexical and grammatical. The semantic marlrers determining the non-singular meanings can be grouped into inflectional <b>affIXes.</b> determinants, zeros and contexts...|$|R
