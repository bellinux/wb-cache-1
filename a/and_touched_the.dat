25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, {{waiting for it to}} come to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible to}} the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, having {{qualified}} as a teacher, Boon left Wales {{to study at}} Dunfermline College of Education, before teaching at Dunfermline High School, while in Scotland he turned out for Dunfermline, though would still play for Cardiff when ever he could. In 1933 Boon was chosen to face England at Twickenham, a stadium Wales had failed to win at in ten attempts. Captained by Watcyn Thomas, Boon later argued that the Welsh forwards deserved all {{the credit for the}} Welsh victory even though Boon scored all the Welsh points in a 7–3 victory. At half-time, England led the game 3–0 with a try from Walter Elliot; but soon after the restart, England's Ronald Gerrard kicked a loose ball across the ground straight into Boon's arms, and he calmly drop kicked the ball through the posts to take a 4–3 lead. A few minutes later Boon had extended the lead when the ball came back from a maul to Davey, who passed to Boon, and with the English defence out of position, he crossed at the corner <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> ball down behind the posts for a try. Vivian Jenkins converted the try which was registered on the score board, but strangely the referee would later disallow the attempt after the game. The decision did not change the result, and Wales had finally beaten the 'Twickenham bogey' and Boon was hailed as a Welsh hero. Boon missed the next game against Scotland due to a knee injury but was back to face Ireland. Wales lost the game and the Welsh selectors dropped 11 of the squad from future fixtures. Those that never played for Wales again after that game included Watcyn Thomas, Arthur Lemon, Harry Bowcott, Lonza Bowdler and Boon himself.|$|E

This was the first time a world record had been set using the V-style, with Piotr Fijas' being the last to use the parallel style.

500|$|Fraser and Navarro {{write that}} it was Evita's work with the {{foundation}} that played {{a large role in}} her idealization, even leading some to consider her a saint. Though it was unnecessary from a practical standpoint, Evita set aside many hours per day to meet with the poor who requested help from her foundation. During these meetings with the poor, Evita often kissed the poor and allowed them to kiss her. Evita was even witnessed placing her hands in the suppurated wounds of the sick and poor, touching the leprous, and kissing the syphilitic. Fraser and Navarro write that though Argentina is secular in many respects, it is essentially a Catholic country. Therefore, when Evita kissed the syphilitic <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> leprous she [...] "...ceased to be the President's wife and acquired some of the characteristics of saints depicted in Catholicism." [...] Poet , a man from a wealthy background, reflected on the times he witnessed Evita meeting with the poor: [...] "I had had a sort of literary perception of the people and the poor and she had given me a Christian one, thus allowing me to become a Christian in the profoundest sense...." ...|$|E

Leopold wrote home: [...] "An {{awful lot of}} this undertaking, blessed be God, is safely over, and, God be praised, once more with honour!" [...] On 26 December, at the Teatro Regio Ducal (Milan's great opera house at the time), Wolfgang directed the first public performance [...] from the keyboard, dressed for the occasion in a scarlet coat lined with blue satin and edged with gold. The occasion was a triumph: the audience demanded encores and at the conclusion cried [...] "Evviva il maestro!" [...] (Long live the master!). The opera ran for 22 performances, and the Gazetta di Milano praised the work handsomely: [...] "The young maestro di capella, who is not yet fifteen years of age, studies the beauties of nature, and represents them adorned with the rarest musical graces." [...] The arias sung by Bernasconi [...] "vividly expressed the passions <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> heart". Subsequent reactions to the opera proved less effusive; there are no records of further performances of Mitridate before its revival in Salzburg in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|Busch had an [...] "up and down" [...] year in 2003, {{finishing}} eleventh in the season's points standings, earning four wins (including {{a season}} sweep at Bristol, {{making him the}} first driver to do that since Rusty Wallace accomplished the feat in 2000), nine Top 5's, and 14 Top 10 finishes but a late season slump put him in this finishing spot in the point standings, although he collected over [...] again that year. Busch was the runner-up finisher in what was the closest finish in all of NASCAR history – this was the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400, held at Darlington on March 16 of that year. The race in this old race track was decided with a two-lap side-by-side battle between him and Ricky Craven. For two laps, the two drivers fought for the victory <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> cars together. When the cars attached, the final lap was ferociously fought ending up with Craven shifting ahead of Busch by 0.002 of a second, making it the closest finish in NASCAR history, tied with the 2011 Aaron's 499. Busch also won the IROC championship before winning a NASCAR championship.|$|E
2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had sat down on the first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if she felt his look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up her head, as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, <b>and</b> <b>touched</b> <b>the</b> latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E
