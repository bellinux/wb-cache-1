6000|$|You do that {{wherever}} you turn and {{wherever you}} look, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> I should say, {{most of all}} at night. It comes to you there with longer knowledge, and with all deference to what flushes and shimmers, that the night is the real time. It perhaps even wouldn't take much to make you award the palm to the nights of winter. This is certainly true {{for the form of}} progression that is most characteristic, for every question of departure and arrival by gondola. The little closed cabin of this perfect vehicle, the movement, the darkness and the plash, the indistinguishable swerves and twists, all the things you don't see and all the things you do feel--each dim recognition and obscure arrest is a possible throb of your sense of being floated to your doom, even when the truth is simply and sociably that you are going out to tea. Nowhere else is anything as innocent so mysterious, nor anything as mysterious so pleasantly deterrent to protest. These are the moments when you are most daringly Venetian, most content to leave cheap trippers and other aliens the high light of the mid-lagoon and the pursuit of pink and gold. The splendid day is good enough for them; what is best for you is to stop at last, as you are now stopping, among clustered pali and softly-shifting poops and prows, at a great flight of water-steps that play their admirable part in the general effect of a great entrance. The high doors stand open from them to the paved chamber of a basement tremendously tall and not vulgarly lighted, from which, in turn, mounts the slow stone staircase that draws you further on. The great point is, that if you are worthy of this impression at all, there isn't a single item of it of which the association isn't noble. Hold to it fast that there is no other such dignity of arrival as arrival by water. Hold to it that to float and slacken and gently bump, to creep out of the low, dark felze and make the few guided movements and find the strong crooked and offered arm, and then, beneath lighted palace-windows, pass up the few damp steps on the precautionary carpet--hold to it that these things constitute a preparation of which the only defect is that it may sometimes perhaps really prepare too much. It's so stately that what can come after?--it's so good in itself that what, upstairs, as we comparative vulgarians say, can be better? Hold to it, at any rate, that if a lady, in especial, scrambles out of a carriage, tumbles out of a cab, flops out of a tram-car, and hurtles, projectile-like, out of a [...] "lightning-elevator," [...] she alights from the Venetian conveyance as Cleopatra may have stepped from her barge. Upstairs--whatever may be yet in store for her--her entrance shall still advantageously enjoy the support most opposed to the [...] "momentum" [...] acquired. The beauty of the matter has been in the absence of all momentum--elsewhere so scientifically applied to us, from behind, by the terrible life of our day--and in the fact that, as the elements of slowness, the felicities of deliberation, doubtless thus all hang together, the last of calculable dangers is to enter a great Venetian room with a rush.|$|E

40|$|Dr. Jennings {{described}} {{his parents and}} his associations with public universities. The procedure for recruiting a person {{to be president of}} a large university is summarized. To improve the financial condition of the university after arriving, the selling of the areas of excellent to the local people – citizens of Ohio, board of trustees, the governor, legislators, and business leaders was a high priority. As a member of some business and community boards, the president not only learns of concerns but can stress that the University is interested in community issues. Dr. Jennings considered a strong faculty senate, a staff council, and a student council essential to “solve” problems and for communication. 	Dr. Jennings compared the University to a large corporation. The major difference is that research and teaching are long run activities. Industry has many short run goals. As the state decreased the percentage of support, the University needed a fundraising operation. The evaluation of a successful operation involved changing the philosophies of many persons. 	The roles of the various members of the Board of Trustees and of the cabinet in improving the University are given. The interaction of the athletic program with the academic programs is discussed. The personnel in athletics created many challenges, both athletic directors and coaches. Another challenge was the development of a medical practice plan with the College of Medicine. Other challenges came from desired changes; use of computers in place of card catalog in the Library, semesters instead of quarters in the College of Law, dealing with the gay community, and class prejudice. Coaches and faculty need to be active in the academic family. 	The procedures for establishing the Ohio’s Selective Excellence Program and its effect on higher education in the state described. Having students (particularly graduate students) from other countries not only improves educational experiences but also provides financial support. 	The president of a large university cannot run the place; he or she must make policy and set the tone. The president needs an outstanding financial officer, a person respected by the politicians and business leaders, and a person respected by the university staff. Three faculty issues were briefly described. One issue was the tenure procedure for faculty at the regional campuses. The second one was {{the pros and cons of}} making librarians faculty members. The third issue was similar, should agricultural extension persons be faculty members? 	A new president is initially inundated with requests for special treatment. A staff member must follow up on the request and provide an answer, either a mistake was made or not. This procedure also was followed with faculty complaints. The president’s financial policies should support his or her educational philosophy. 	The president’s policy for hiring persons is very important. The persons hired for top-level positions should have outstanding leadership skills instead of administrative skills. For other employees, “This is what I want you to do and I’m going to turn you loose <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> ” 	The factors that led to his retirement are summarized. 	Dr. Jennings discusses the changes in the land grant mission due to financial restraints. To meet the original mission, other colleges and universities in the state should be included in the land grant system. Leading Themes 1.
