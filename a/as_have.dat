30|$|We {{constructed}} {{a set of}} vignettes which allowed us to gauge how people who are described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs are viewed in relation {{to people who are}} described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability. If special needs is an ineffective euphemism, as we predicted, then people described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs should be viewed more negatively than people described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability, which is what we observed. Indeed, as we predicted, when people were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs, they were viewed more negatively than when they were described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a specific disability (e.g., is blind, has Down syndrome, is autistic, has ADHD).|$|R

5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives <b>as</b> <b>have</b> the Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no factors have been associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of <b>AS</b> <b>have</b> many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, <b>as</b> <b>have</b> many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such <b>as</b> <b>have</b> and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{characters}} described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> {{special needs}} were most frequently chosen last, indicating that special needs is an ineffective euphemism. Characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs were chosen last even {{more frequently than}} characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability or a certain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized term disability or the names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind). If special needs was an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> special needs were chosen last less often than characters described <b>as</b> <b>having</b> a disability or a certain disability. But, as predicted, we observed just the opposite.|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{extensive}} ethnomedical tradition, the phytochemistry of P.atriplicifolia {{has been}} the topic of several studies. Analysis of the plant's essential oil has identified over two dozen compounds, although the compounds detected and their relative prevalence have not been consistent. Most analyses have identified various monoterpenes and monoterpenoids as the dominant components, such as carene, eucalyptol, limonene, γ-terpinene, and (+)-β-thujone, although the essential oil of a sample from the Orto Botanico dell'Università di Torino had camphor as its most prevalent component. Other monoterpenes, camphene, α-pinene, and β-pinene are also present, as are sesquiterpenes such as γ-cadinene, δ-cadinene, trans-caryophyllene, and α-humulene. Several terpenoid alcohols—borneol, cedrol, and menthol—have been extracted from P.atriplicifolia, <b>as</b> <b>have</b> caffeic acid and ferulic acid. More complex compounds have been isolated, {{some of which were}} first identified in this manner, including perovskatone; the glycosides atriplisides A and B; and atricins A and B, a pair of triterpenes that are similar to oleanane.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Hamilton's early {{participation}} in the American Revolution, his abolitionist sensibilities had become evident. Hamilton was active during the Revolution in trying to raise black troops for the army, {{with the promise of}} freedom. In the 1780s and 1790s he generally opposed pro-slavery southern interests, which he saw as hypocritical to the values of the American Revolution. In 1785 he joined his close associate John Jay in founding the New-York Society for Promoting the Manumission of Slaves, and Protecting Such of Them <b>as</b> <b>Have</b> Been, or May be Liberated, the main anti-slavery organization in New York. The society successfully promoted the abolition of the international slave trade in New York City and (shortly after his death) passed a state law to end slavery in New York through a decades-long process of emancipation, with a final end to slavery in the state on July 4, 1827.|$|E

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, <b>as</b> <b>have</b> condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds.

Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
