40|$|Croatian {{quota of}} 180. 000 tones of sugar beet per year is {{approved}} for export to EU countries. For {{that amount of}} sugar {{it is necessary to}} produce about 30. 000 ha of sugar beet. Sugar beet production requires deep and fertile soils, and crop rotation requirement is at least five year. Therefore, Slavonia and Baranya do t have enough <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> sugar <b>beet.</b> An additional problem is so called “sugar reform” applied by EUaiming to decrease price of sugar produced from sugar beet root and its equalization to sugar cane price. Consequences of this movement will be decreasing of sugar beet domestic redemption price. In that way, sugar beet production will be increased only within producers with relative good soils, suitable mechanization and knowledge. The research shows the results of production sugar beet on family farm of Vukovar – SrijemCounty on 21 ha. Technical and technological process includes 35 working operations spending 26. 9 hours/ha of mechanization and 65. 8 hours/ha of labor. Total costs amount to 15. 947, 05 kn/ha. Producers paid for seed 1. 405, 44 kn/ha or 9. 4 % and for 1. 100 kg of fertilizers 2. 217, 50 kn/ha or 14. 8 % of total costs. Significant values are also costs for plant protection (9 l/ha) being 15. 2 % of total cost. Mechanization fee is 5. 070, 96 kn/ha with share of 33. 9 % what indicates that {{this is the most important}} element in total costs, partly as a consequence of increased distance between arable land and farm. Total value of production is 20. 759, 59 kn/ha, with yields of the root (70. 30 t/ha) and government subsidies. Amount of 1. 068, 82 kg root is producedper hour of human labour; while 0. 94 hour of human labour is necessary per tone of products. Economic coefficient is 1. 36.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the determination of total <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> curves from various metabolic studies. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — In Tai's Model, the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve is computed by dividing the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than ± 0. 4 %). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a metabolic curve by a great margin. RESULTS — Tai's model proves {{to be able to}} 1) determine total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes {{that may or may not}} intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; an...|$|R
