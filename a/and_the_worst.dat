5|$|Barkley won the August 6 {{election}} {{by a vote}} of 294,391 to 223,149, carrying 74 of Kentucky's 120 counties, with large majorities in western Kentucky, the city of Louisville, and rural areas. It was the first loss of Chandler's political career, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> suffered by a primary candidate in Kentucky's history to that time. Barkley defeated his Republican opponent, Louisville Judge John P. Haswell, securing 62% of the general election vote. Encouraged by Barkley's success, Roosevelt campaigned against conservative Democratic incumbents in southern states, but all of these candidates won, which damaged Roosevelt's image.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal seams were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5|$|The Blue Jackets {{began the}} year with the worst start in {{franchise}} history <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> by any team in an NHL season in 19 years. After an 11–25–5 start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of All-Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off-season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets' captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested to be traded, though he would remain with the team for the entire season.|$|E

5|$|The Vukovar massacre, {{also known}} as the Vukovar {{hospital}} massacre or the Ovčara massacre, was the killing of Croatian prisoners of war and civilians by Serb paramilitaries and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) at the Ovčara farm southeast of Vukovar on 20 November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre occurred shortly after Vukovar's capture by the JNA, Croatian Serb Territorial Defence (TO), and paramilitaries from neighbouring Serbia. It was the largest massacre of the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> war crime in Europe since World War II up until that point.|$|E
5|$|A second Legislative Council {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 {{with the number of}} elected seats increased to nine. This {{election was}} again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election would replace the Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Reid, {{writing in}} 1862, {{recorded}} some statistics {{of a typical}} voyage. The ship, with a crew of 143, put out from Liverpool on 21 October 1861, carrying 544 passengers (including the English cricket team {{that was the first}} to visit Australia), a cow, 36 sheep, 140 pigs, 96 goats and 1,114 chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. The journey to Melbourne (her ninth) occupied 64 days, during which the best day's run was 354miles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> 108. With favourable winds the ship travelled under sail alone, the screw being withdrawn from the water. Three passengers died en route. The captain was John Gray, a Scot, who had held the post since before the Crimean War.|$|E

5|$|For the 2005 season, the Packers, despite {{throwing}} {{for over}} 3,000yards {{for a record}} 14th consecutive time, Favre had a below average season with only 20 touchdown passes and a league-leading 29 interceptions. The loss of guards Marco Rivera and Mike Wahle to free agency along with key injuries to Javon Walker, Ahman Green, Bubba Franks, among others, hampered Favre and the team. His passer rating was 70.9, 31st in the NFL <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> single season rating of his career. After the disappointing season, many speculated that Favre would retire. However, on April 26, 2006, Favre {{announced that he would}} remain with the team for the 2006 season. Despite earlier comments that the 2006 season would be his last, Favre announced in a press conference on May 6, 2006, that he had not ruled out the possibility of returning beyond the 2006 season.|$|E
5|$|From the 2007 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) results, Poole {{was ranked}} 18th out of 148 local {{authorities}} in England {{based on the}} percentage of pupils attaining at least five A* to C grades at GCSE level including maths and English (54.5% compared with {{the national average of}} 46.8%). Parkstone Grammar School was the most successful secondary school in Poole for GCSE results in 2007: 100% of pupils gained five or more GCSEs at A* to C grade including maths and English. Canford School also achieved 100% and Poole Grammar School was the next best performing school with 98%. Poole High School achieved 39% <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> performing school was Rossmore Community College where only 19% of students achieved five or more A* to C grade results. Poole's grammar schools were also the best performing for A-level results. Poole Grammar School was the 60th most successful school/sixth form in the country in 2007: each student achieved on average 1071.4 points compared to the national average of 731.2. Parkstone Grammar School students averaged 1017.9 points.|$|E
5|$|After the 76ers {{got off to}} an 0–16 {{start to}} the season, Okafor was {{involved}} in a street fight with taunting individuals on November 25 in Boston. On November 30, with additional reports surfacing that Okafor had been involved in various controversial and dangerous off-the-court situations, the 76ers agreed to a request to assign a security guard to accompany Okafor in public. On December 1, Okafor and the 76ers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 103–91. The win ended the longest losing streak in the history of major professional sports in the United States (28 games going back to the prior season) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> start in NBA history (tied with the 2009–10 New Jersey Nets at 0–18). The next day, video surfaced on TMZ of a second fight in Boston from November. Okafor was subsequently suspended by the 76ers for two games. He returned from suspension against the San Antonio Spurs on December 7, recording 10 points and 4 rebounds off the bench in a 119–68 defeat. On January 16, 2016, he recorded 25 points and 10 rebounds in a 114–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, helping the 76ers snap a four-game losing streak and improving their record to 5–37. On January 27, 2016, he was named to the 2016 NBA All-Star Game weekend Rising Stars Challenge lineup.|$|E

5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, who owned the first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, who owned the second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E

25|$|The changes {{did little}} to improve the Flyers {{fortunes}} in 2006–07 as setting franchise records for futility became the norm. They had several multiple-game losing streaks including a franchise worst ten-game losing streak and a 13-game home losing streak that stretched from November 29 to February 10. Ultimately, the Flyers finished with a 22–48–12 record – the most losses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> winning percentage in franchise history, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> record in the League. They also set the NHL record for the biggest points drop off in the standings in a one-year span (101 points in 2005–06 to 56 points in 2006–07, a difference of 45 points). The Flyers were left further dejected as they lost the NHL draft lottery and were demoted to the second overall selection.|$|E
