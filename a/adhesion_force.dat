40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} streptococcal <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> with composite resins {{with different}} surface roughness. METHODS: Polishing and grinding {{were applied to}} obtain smooth (roughness 20 nm), moderately rough (150 nm) and rough (350 nm) surfaces of two orthodontic, light-cured composites. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> between Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mutans and the composite surfaces were measured using atomic force microscopy in absence or presence of a salivary conditioning film. Initial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were measured as well adhesion after 120 s of contact, as longer contact times are known to result in stronger <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> ("bond-strengthening"). Surface roughness in absence and presence of salivary conditioning films were compared using ANOVA, while <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were subjected to a Weibull analysis. RESULTS: Initial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> in absence of a salivary conditioning film amounted between - 0. 7 and - 0. 9 nN for smooth composite resins and increased between - 1. 0 and - 2. 0 nN for the roughest surfaces. Streptococcal <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> after bond-strengthening were significantly stronger than upon initial contact, irrespective of the composite type. Salivary conditioning films significantly decreased the surface roughness of the composites, {{as well as the}} streptococcal <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces.</b> Yet, also {{in the presence of a}} conditioning film, rougher composite surfaces exerted stronger <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces,</b> irrespective of composite type or bacterial strain. CONCLUSION: Streptococcal <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> to orthodontic composite resins increase with increasing roughness of the composite surfaces.

Initial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> differed significantly {{between the two}} surfaces and hovered around - 0. 4 nN. No unambiguous effect of substratum surface hydrophobicity on initial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> for the four different S. epidermidis strains was observed. Over time, strengthening of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> was virtually absent on hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS) -coated glass, although {{in a few cases}} multiple adhesion peaks developed in the retract curves. Bond-strengthening on hydrophilic glass occurred within 5 - 35 s to maximum <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> of - 1. 9 +/- 0. 7 nN and was concurrent with the development of multiple adhesion peaks upon retract. Poisson analysis of the multiple adhesion peaks allowed separation of contributions of hydrogen bonding from other nonspecific interaction forces and revealed a force contribution of - 0. 8 nN for hydrogen bonding and + 0. 3 nN for other nonspecific interaction <b>forces.</b> Time-dependent bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were comparable for all four staphylococcal strains.

Therefore, understanding the underlying factors that contribute to bacteria-biomaterial interactions are of utmost importance for researchers and health care professionals who develop biomaterials and new anti-bacterials. In this context, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the role of <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> in the response of bacteria to their adhering state. To this end, we used a model pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, common in biomaterial associated infections and several of its isogenic mutants and applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Surface Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) to quantify <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> and cell wall deformation, respectively. Bacterial response was evaluated in terms of gene expression on different biomaterials commonly used in orthopedic implants. Our findings show that S. aureus experiences <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> in the range 1. 0 – 5. 0 nN on the three biomaterials Stainless Steel (SS), Poly-Methylmethacrylate (PMMA) and Polyethylene (PE) and provide proof of concept that <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> induce cell wall deformation upon adhesion to SS using SEF. At the molecular level we show that, as <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> increase between the bacteria and the substratum, icaA gene expression and the expression of matrix components (Poly-N-acethyglocosamine and eDNA) decreases, suggesting a direct impact of <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> on gene expression.

We compared the <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe.

50|$|Molecules adsorbed on {{a surface}} are {{picked up by}} a {{microscopic}} tip (nanometres wide) that is located on the end of an elastic cantilever. In a more sophisticated version of this experiment (Chemical Force Microscopy) the tips are covalently functionalized with the molecules of interest. A piezoelectric controller then pulls up the cantilever. If some force is acting on the elastic cantilever (for example because some molecule is being stretched between the surface and the tip), this will deflect upward (repulsive force) or downward (attractive force). According to Hooke's law, this deflection will be proportional to the force acting on the cantilever. Deflection is measured by the position of a laser beam reflected by the cantilever. This kind of set-up can measure forces as low as 10 pN (10−11 N), and cannot achieve much better resolution only because of thermal noise. The so-called force curve is the graph of force (or more precisely, of cantilever deflection) versus the piezoelectric position on the Z axis. An ideal Hookean spring, for example, would display a straight diagonal force curve.Typically, the force curves observed in the force spectroscopy experiments consist of a contact (diagonal) region where the probe contacts the sample surface, and a non-contact region where the probe is off the sample surface. When the restoring force of the cantilever exceeds tip-sample <b>adhesion</b> <b>force</b> the probe jumps out of contact, and the magnitude of this jump is often used as a measure of <b>adhesion</b> <b>force</b> or rupture force. In general the rupture of a tip-surface bond is a stochastic process; therefore reliable quantification of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>force</b> requires taking multiple individual force curves. The histogram of the adhesion forces obtained in these multiple measurements provides the main data output for force spectroscopy measurement.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, the {{amphiphilic}} {{nature of}} the Janus nanoparticles was examined by measuring the <b>adhesion</b> <b>force</b> between the atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the particle surface. The stronger interactions between the hydrophilic AFM tip and the hydrophilic side of the Janus nanoparticles were reflected by a greater <b>adhesion</b> <b>force.</b> The Janus nanoparticles were dropcast onto both hydrophobically and hydrophilically modified substrates. The hydrophobic hemisphere of the Janus particles was exposed when a hydrophilic substrate surface was used, resulting in disparities in <b>adhesion</b> <b>force</b> measurements. Thus, the Janus nanoparticles adopted a conformation that maximized the interactions with the substrate surface. The nature of amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles to orient themselves spontaneously at the interface between oil and water has been well known. This behavior allows considering amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles as analogues of molecular surfactants for the stabilization of emulsions. In 2005, spherical silica particles with amphiphilic properties were prepared by partial modification of the external surface with an alkylsilane agent. These particles form spherical assemblies encapsulating water-immiscible organic compounds in aqueous media by facing their hydrophobic alkylsilylated side to the inner organic phase and their hydrophilic side to the outer aqueous phase, thus stabilizing oil droplets in water. In 2009, hydrophilic surface of silica particles was made partially hydrophobic by adsorbing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. These amphiphilic nanoparticles spontaneously assembled at the water-dichloromethane interface. In 2010, Janus particles composed from silica and polystyrene, with the polystyrene portion loaded with nanosized magnetite particles, were used to form kinetically stable oil-in-water emulsions that can be spontaneously broken on application of an external magnetic field. Such Janus materials will find applications in magnetically controlled optical switches and other related areas.The first real applications of Janus nanoparticles were in polymer synthesis. In 2008, spherical amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles, having one polystyrene and one poly(methyl methacrylate) side, were shown to be effective as compatibilizing agents of multigram scale compatibilization of two immiscible polymer blends, polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate). The Janus nanoparticles oriented themselves at the interface of the two polymer phases, even under high temperature and shear conditions, allowing the formation of much smaller domains of poly(methyl methacrylate) in a polystyrene phase. The performance of the Janus nanoparticles as compatibilizing agents was significantly superior to other state-of-the-art compatibilizers, such as linear block copolymers.|$|E

Both morphological forms of C. albicans are found in infected tissue, often in combination with Staphylococcus aureus. Although bacterial adhesion to the different morphologies of C. albicans has been amply studied, possible differences in staphylococcal <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> along the length of C. albicans hyphae have never been determined. In this study, we aim to verify the hypothesis that the forces mediating S. aureus NCTC 8325 - 4 GFP adhesion to hyphae vary along the length of C. albicans SC 5314 and MB 1 hyphae, as compared with adhesion to yeast cells. Results C. albicans hyphae were virtually divided into a “tip” (the growing and therefore youngest part of the hyphae), a “middle” and a so-called “head” region (the yeast cell from which germination started). <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> between S. aureus NCTC 8325 - 4 GFP and the different regions of C. albicans SC 5314 hyphae were measured using atomic <b>force</b> microscopy. Strong <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were found at the tip and middle regions of C. albicans hyphae (− 4. 1 nN and − 4. 0 nN, respectively), while much smaller <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were measured at the head region (− 0. 3 nN). <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> exerted by the head region were comparable with the forces arising from budding yeast cells (− 0. 5 nN).

Methods: <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> of bacterial strains to Ag-impregnated and polypropylene lens cases and a rigid CL were measured using atomic <b>force</b> microscopy. <b>Adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> were used to calculate Weibull distributions, from which transmission probabilities from lens case to CL were derived. Transmission probabilities were compared with actual transmission of viable bacteria from a lens case to the CL in 0. 9 % NaCl and in an antimicrobial lens care solution. Results: Bacterial transmission probabilities from polypropylene lens cases based on force analysis coincided well for all strains with actual transmission in 0. 9 % NaCl. Bacterial <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces</b> on Ag-impregnated lens cases were much smaller than that on polypropylene and CLs, yielding a high probability of transmission. Comparison with actual bacterial transmission indicated bacterial killing due to Ag ions during colony-forming unit transmission from an Ag-impregnated lens case, especially for P. aeruginosa. Transmission of viable bacteria from Ag-impregnated lens cases could be further decreased by use of an antimicrobial lens care solution instead of 0. 9 % NaCl. Conclusions: Bacterial transmission probabilities are higher from Ag-impregnated lens cases than from polypropylene lens cases because of small <b>adhesion</b> <b>forces,</b> but this is compensated for by enhanced bacterial killing due to Ag impregnation, especially when in combination with an antimicrobial lens care solution. This calls for a balanced combination of antimicrobial lens care solutions and surface properties of a lens case and CL. ...|$|R
