40|$|Spectral {{molecular}} line profile observations of star-forming molecular clouds sometimes show distinct red asymmetric double-peaked {{molecular line}} profiles with weaker blue peaks and stronger red peaks. For some star-forming molecular clouds, such molecular transitions with red <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles and blue <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles (i. e. blue asymmetric double-peaked molecular line profiles with weaker red peaks and stronger blue peaks) may coexist in spatially resolved spectral observations, while for others, such molecular transitions with red <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles may completely dominate in spatially resolved spectral observations. Blue <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles are usually interpreted as signals of central core collapses, while red <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles remain unexplained. In this paper, we advance a spherically symmetric self-similar hydrodynamic model framework for envelope expansions with core collapses (EECC) {{of a general}} polytropic molecular gas cloud under self-gravity. Based on such EECC hydrodynamic cloud models, we perform tracer molecular line profile calculations using the publicly available RATRAN code for star-forming clouds with spectroscopic signatures of red <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles. The presence of red <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles from molecular cloud cores indicates that EECC processes are most likely an essential hydrodynamic process of star formation. With spatial distributions, we explore various profiles of molecular lines for several tracer molecules in different settings of EECC dynamic models with and without shocks.

40|$|Weused {{electron}} spin resonance (ESR) to analyze several kinds of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) synthesized by different methods. We observed that ESR is a sensitive probe {{that can be used}} to observe major differences between samples of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), in relation to their proportion of magnetic catalysts, impurities or defects. We analyzed the ESR spectra of CNTs in the usual way, by three overlapping lines. We then, implemented a function to fit the spectra, which gave us the intensity, line width (DHPP), and resonance line position (g factor) of each component line. The <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line,</b> which is assigned to the conduction electrons, could be used as a fingerprint of CNT purity. However, this <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> is not always observed, since the three ESR lines often overlap, particularly when there is a large amount of paramagnetic ions. We studied the ESR spectra for different samples and estimated their purity by comparing the resulting parameters with data obtained by Raman spectroscopy on the same samples.

Such asymmetry can be used to increase the thermoelectric efficiency of molecular junctions. So far, however, <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> shapes have been only empirically found for just a few rather complex organic molecules where the origins of the line shapes relation to molecular structure were not resolved. In the present work we introduce a method to analyze the structure dependence of the asymmetry of interference dips from simple two site tight-binding models, where one site corresponds to a molecular π orbital of the wire and the other to an atomic p_z orbital of a side group, which allows us to analytically characterize the peak shape in terms of just two parameters. We assess our scheme with first-principles electron transport calculations for a variety of t-stub molecules and also address their suitability for thermoelectric applications.

The strength of H-beta(broad) {{has increased by}} a factor of 6. 6 in 4 yr, and the galaxy now shows strong broad UV and optical line emission similar to that seen in normal Seyfert 1 galaxies, but with markedly <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles. As in other variable Seyfert galaxies, H-alpha emission has also increased but by a lesser amount than H-beta. Furthermore, Ly-alpha (not observed during the first epoch) is now quite strong relative to H-beta and H-alpha. Inspection of the line profiles reveals nearly identical blue <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles in all permitted lines; these show evidence of significant profile evolution over a 1 yr time scale. The present line ratios and the nature of their variability suggest that the enhancement in the broad-line emission is not caused by the removal of obscuring dust but by the 'lighting up' of the broad-line region...|$|E

40|$|The {{observation}} of the Kondo effect in mesoscopic systems under bias$^{ 1, 2 }$ has opened {{a new chapter in}} the physics of the Kondo phenomenon. Various types of $dI/dV$, where $I$ and $V$ denote current and source-drain (s-d) bias, respectively, line shapes have been measured by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) $^{ 1, 3 - 11 }$. However, explanation by single Fano line shape$^{ 1, 12 - 16 }$ is not relevant and even misleading. Here, we provide consistent explanations for various asymmetric and symmetric line shapes in terms of a microscopic theory that shows the creation of two resonant tunneling levels (RTLs) when bias is applied$^{ 17 }$. One side Kondo coupling between adatom and substrate does not create Kondo peak that appears only when the system has an overall Kondo coupling including both substrate and tip. The structure of an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> shape is mostly governed by the RTL peaks. Therefore, Kondo effect is negligible in most <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> shapes.

40|$|Optical quasar spectra {{can be used}} {{to trace}} {{variations}} of the fine-structure constant alpha. Controversial results that have been published in last years suggest that in addition to to wavelength calibration problems systematic errors might arise because of insufficient spectral resolution. The aim of this work is to estimate the impact of incorrect line decompositions in fitting procedures due to <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles. Methods are developed to distinguish between different sources of line position shifts and thus to minimize error sources in future work. To simulate <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles, two different methods were used. At first the profile was created as an unresolved blend of narrow lines and then, the profile was created using a macroscopic velocity field of the absorbing medium. The simulated spectra were analysed with standard methods to search for apparent shifts of line positions that would mimic a variation of fundamental constants. Differences between position shifts due to an incorrect line decomposition and a real variation of constants were probed using methods that have been newly developed or adapted for this kind of analysis. The results were then applied to real data. Apparent relative velocity shifts of several hundred meters per second are found in the analysis of simulated spectra with <b>asymmetric</b> <b>line</b> profiles. It was found that each system has to be analysed in detail to distinguish between different sources of line position shifts. A set of 16 FeII systems in seven quasar spectra was analysed. With the methods developed, the mean alpha variation that appeared in these systems was reduced from the original Dalpha/alpha=(2. 1 +/- 2. 0) x 10 ^- 5 to Dalpha/alpha=(0. 1 +/- 0. 8) x 10 ^- 5.

The trailing stratiform region formed as dissipating convection in the northern portion of the western squall line merged with the developing stratiform precipitation region associated with the eastern squall line. Intense storm-relative rear inflow was present at the rear of the northern portion of the western squall line. A pronounced anticyclonic circulation associated with a bow echo along the leading edge of the southern portion of the western squall line affected the intensity of convection in the southern part of the domain as the flow entered the rear of the convective line and accelerated towards the leading edge causing intense upward motion and strong convection...|$|R

In the near future, the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) will allow observers to study recombination lines in the radio and submillimetre regimes in unprecedented detail. In this paper, we study the properties of recombination lines, in particular at ALMA wavelengths. We find that such lines will lie in almost every wideband ALMA set-up and that the line emission will be equally detectable in all bands. Furthermore, we present our implementation of hydrogen recombination lines in the adaptive-mesh radiative transfer code RADMC- 3 D.
