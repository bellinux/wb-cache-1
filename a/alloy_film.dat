40|$|In this study, 15 nm-thick sputter-deposited TiVCr alloy {{thin films}} were {{developed}} as diffusion barrier layers for Cu interconnects. The TiVCr <b>alloy</b> <b>film</b> tends {{to form a}} solid solution and a simple crystal structure from the constituted elements. Under TEM, the 15 nm-thick as-deposited TiVCr <b>alloy</b> <b>film</b> was observed to have a dense semi-amorphous or nanocrystalline structure. In conjunction with X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy analyses, the Si/TiVCr/Cu film stack remained stable at a high temperature of 700 degrees C for 30 min. The electrical resistance of Si/TiVCr/Cu film stack remained as low as the as-deposited value. These indicated that the mixed TiVCr refractory elements' alloy barrier layer is very beneficial to prevent Cu diffusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The high purity ZnO ceramic {{target and}} the (MgO) (0. 1) (ZnO) (0. 9) target were fabricated. The wurtzite-phase ZnO thin film and ternary MgxZn 1 -xO thin film were grown on {{sapphire}} (0001) substrates by laser {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (L-MBE) from the sintered ceramic targets separately. The films&# 39; transmittance spectra {{at room temperature for}} the ZnO film and the MgxZn 1 -xO film were measured and compared while their room temperature photoluminescence spectra were done. The band-gap modulation is realized from 3. 31 eV for the ZnO film to 3. 64 eV for the MgxZn 1 -xO <b>alloy</b> <b>film.</b> The Mg content x in the MgxZn 1 -xO <b>alloy</b> <b>film</b> was determined to be 0. 18.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the technique of barrier self-formation using Cu(Ti) <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> on porous low-k dielectric layers, Cu(1 at. % Ti) <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> were deposited on porous SiOCH (low-k) dielectric layers in samples with and without ~ 6. 5 -nm-thick SiCN pore seals. Ti-rich barrier layers successfully self-formed on the porous low-k layer of both sample types after annealing in Ar for 2 h at 400 °C to 600 °C. The Ti-rich barrier layers consisted of amorphous Ti oxides and polycrystalline TiC for the samples without pore sealing, and amorphous TiN, TiC, and Ti oxides for the pore-sealed samples. The amorphous TiN originated from reaction of Ti atoms with the pore seal, and formed beneath the Cu <b>alloy</b> <b>films.</b> This may explain two peaks of Ti segregation at the interface that appeared in Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) profiles, and suggests that the Ti-rich barrier layers self-formed by the reaction of Ti atoms with the pore seal and porous low-k layers separately. The total molar amount of Ti atoms segregated at the interface in the pore-sealed samples was larger than that in the samples without pore sealing, resulting in lower resistivity. On the other hand, resistivity of the Cu <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> annealed on the porous low-k layers was lower than that annealed on the nonporous low-k layers. Coarser Cu columnar grains were observed in the Cu <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> annealed on the porous low-k layers, although the molar amount of Ti atoms segregated at the interface was similar in both sample types after annealing. The cause could be faster reaction of the Ti atoms with the porous dielectric layers...|$|R
40|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{fabricate}} Fe 80 Ni 20 -O film with improved static and high-frequency, magnetic and electrical properties. Fe 80 Ni 20 -O <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> were prepared by direct current magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The {{results show that the}} in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy fields can be adjusted in a broad range by solely adding a very low dose of oxygen into Fe 80 Ni 20 <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> without applying any inducing field on substrates during deposition. By increasing the oxygen flow ratio from 0. 75 % to 3 %, Fe 80 Ni 20 -O <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> could be achieved with an adjustable ferromagnetic resonance frequency fr (from 2. 2 to 5. 9 GHz), a large saturation magnetization 4 蟺Ms (from 16. 7 to 15. 2 kG), and a high resistivity 蟻 (from 56. 7 to 108 渭惟 cm). 漏 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Depending on the {{deposition}} conditions, amorphous SixH y <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> prepared by planar rf reactive magnetron sputtering exhibit {{one of three}} types of microstructure: (i) type A with no discernible microstructural features down to the 20 -Å level and with a smooth uniform density; (ii) type B consisting of high-density regions of 50 - 200 -Å lateral dimensions separated by a low-density network; and (iii) a two-level (type C) microstructure consisting of 300 - 500 -Å dimensions columns separated by a pronounced low-density network. The columns, in turn, are composed of 50 - 200 -Å dimension high-density regions interspersed with low-density network. The Si- 2 p level in these <b>alloy</b> <b>films,</b> determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, is observed to be strongly influenced by the microstructure of the film. A shift in the Si- 2 p level, systematically varying with the hydrogen concentration, is observed in <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> with type B and type C microstructures. No shift is observed, irrespective of the hydrogen concentration, in <b>alloy</b> <b>films</b> with type A microstructure. The photoelectron spectra are examined {{in the light of}} the vibrational spectra of the films as measured by Fourier transform infrared techniques. The dependence of the Si- 2 p level shift on the microstructure and the variation with hydrogen concentration are explained qualitatively in terms of the differences in the silicon-hydrogen bonding in amorphous SixHy films with dissimilar microstructures...|$|R
