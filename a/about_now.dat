The fans seem to trust this line-up, and I don't blame them. We've kind of jumped this emotional hurdle together. Ricky's writing some fucking killer lyrics, and {{with the kind of}} talent that's in Thin Lizzy now I think we can pull off a really cool set of tunes. At least it's something that we can think <b>about</b> <b>now,</b> where before it wasn't on the table."

500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, what are we talking <b>about</b> <b>now</b> all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E

But how <b>about</b> <b>now,</b> we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.' So I was like 'Yeah, I got to sing on it!'"

[...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing.

Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real?

It was lovely to be nominated, and also a bit hilarious, but beyond that, I wasn't desperate to win. I really wasn't bothered! I was more than happy that Roxanne [...] won it — and I guessed she might do anyway." [...] When Zoe's affair with Mike Barnes (Tony Hirst) began, there was some controversy over the storyline, due to the age gap between the pair. However, Hirst stated: [...] "I think the controversy has subsided somewhat. It's not an illicit affair, it's known <b>about</b> <b>now.</b> It was shocking to some people at the beginning but it wasn't by any means illegal.

I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about a single thing, that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost forgotten what we were arguing <b>about</b> <b>now,</b> as now we are both very pleased with the script.
