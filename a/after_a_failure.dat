5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to {{assimilate}} Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, {{prior to the}} introduction of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E
5|$|The first railway to Milford Haven {{was with}} the {{completion}} of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford, (Neyland), which was completed in April 1856. The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863, which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway. The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway. Today the town is served by Milford Haven railway station. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Arriva Trains Wales on the West Wales Line. It is the terminus, and from here, trains depart every two hours to Manchester Piccadilly via Carmarthen, Swansea, and Cardiff Central.|$|E

On 12 June 2006, the station bought an EPG slot on Sky channel 0199.

He won his first Formula One race at the 1969 United States Grand Prix. He had a very successful 1970 season, mainly racing the revolutionary Lotus 72, and won five of the first nine races. In practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, he spun into the guardrails <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> on his car's brake shaft. Rindt was killed owing to severe throat injuries caused by his seat belt; he was pronounced dead while on the way to hospital. As his closest competitor Jacky Ickx was unable to score sufficient points in the remaining races of the season, Rindt was awarded the World Championship posthumously.|$|E
500|$|Hutton was {{selected}} for the first Test, but England were overwhelmed by the Australian fast bowlers and lost the match. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> in the first innings, Hutton scored 74 in the second, and briefly established dominance over Miller, who responded {{with a series of}} bouncers, one of which struck Hutton on the shoulder and provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Miller [...] him in very poor light {{at the start of the}} fourth day's play. At Lord's in the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13, but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted. In the second innings, England had to bat for a long time to save the game, Wisden noted that Hutton, in contrast to his opening partner Washbrook, looked [...] "plainly uncomfortable". He was nearly dismissed several times before he was out for 13, and returned to the pavilion to an uncomfortable silence from the crowd. The former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton, covering the tour as a journalist, described it as Hutton's worst effort in a Test. Bill O'Reilly, another former Australian player working as a journalist, said Hutton seemed to be struggling with concentration and was a shadow of his former self.|$|E

500|$|Hobbs toured Australia {{with the}} MCC during the 1920â€“21 season, under the {{captaincy}} of J. W. H. T. Douglas, when Australia won every match of the five-Test series. He {{was one of}} the few English successes. He scored two centuries in the opening three first-class games, and in the first Test top-scored in both England innings with 49 and 59. In the second Test, he scored 122 on a difficult pitch which had been affected by rain. Wisden commented that this was [...] "from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour". He also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game. He did not pass 50 again in the series; <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> on the fourth Test, he tore a thigh muscle batting in a game before the final Test. Persuaded by Douglas to play anyway, he scored 40 and 34 but struggled to field effectively. One unsuccessful attempt to chase the ball caused some of the crowd to jeer him, which led to controversy when two amateur members of the team, Percy Fender and Rockley Wilson, wrote scathingly about the incident. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; in Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50. Although he and Rhodes resumed their opening partnership, apart from in the first Test, when C. A. G. Russell partnered Hobbs, they could not replicate their former successes, and shared only one stand worth more than fifty.|$|E
2500|$|Pre-set triggers, only {{recently}} coming into vogue, offer {{a balance of}} pull weight, trigger travel, safety, and consistency. Glock popularized this trigger in modern pistols and many other manufacturers have released pre-set striker products of their own. The primary disadvantage is that pulling the trigger a second time <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to fire will not re-strike the primer. In normal handling of the firearm, {{this is not an}} issue; loading the gun requires that the slide be retracted, pre-setting the striker. Clearing a malfunction also usually involves retracting the slide following the [...] "tap rack bang" [...] procedure. Many similar approaches are argued for generally accomplishing the same end.|$|E
