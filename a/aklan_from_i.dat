50|$|The {{capital of}} Akean changed several times. Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, Datu Dinagandan moved the capital from the present Batan, which was {{captured}} in 1399 by Chinese adventurers under Kalantiaw. Kalantiaw established then a dynasty but it prematurely ended when his successor, Kalantiaw III, was slain in a duel with Datu Manduyog, the legitimate successor to Datu Dinagandan. When Manduyog became the new ruler, he moved the capital back to Bakan (ancient name of Banga) in 1437. Several datus succeeded Manduyog and when Miguel Lopez de Legaspi landed in Batan in 1565, Datu Kabanyag was ruling <b>Aklan</b> <b>from</b> what is now the town of Libacao.|$|R

25|$|Aklan {{became an}} {{independent}} province through Republic Act No. 1414 signed by Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay on April 25, 1956, separating <b>Aklan</b> <b>from</b> Capiz. The original towns were Altavas, Balete, Batan, Banga, Buruanga, Ibajay, Kalibo, Lezo, Libacao, Madalag, Malay, Makato, Malinao, Nabas, New Washington, Numancia, and Tangalan, then {{all part of}} the province of Capiz. The province was inaugurated on November 8, 1956. José Raz Menez was appointed the first governor of Aklan by President Magsaysay and he served until December 30, 1959. In 1960, Godofredo P. Ramos became the first elected governor but upon resigning to run for Congress he was succeeded by the vice governor, Virgilio S. Patricio. In 1964, José B. Legaspi succeeded Patricio and he held office for two consecutive terms from 1964 to 1971.|$|R
40|$|The {{excessive}} {{fishing activities}} {{have led to}} the depletion of many coastal fisheries resources in most of the countries in Southeast Asia. It is therefore necessary to find out the causal factors of excessive fishing in order to build up effective fisheries management system. This paper highlights {{the results of the study}} that investigated the overfishing or excessive fishing in Batan Estuary, Aklan, Central Philippines. The data were gathered through an interview of selected households in Barangay Pinamuk-an, <b>Aklan</b> <b>from</b> March 2 - 26 2010. Of the 93 respondent-households, 67 or 72 % is engaged in fishing. The most popular fishing gear was the small set net with synthetic fiber, which was introduced to the community in the latter part of 1970 s. The relatively lower cost of this small fishing gear, and a few labor force requirement, including its availability in nearby market made it easier for the fisherfolks to acquire this fishing gear. The small set net with synthetic fiber has been widely used by the fishers, which led to the overuse of the fishing grounds in the Batan Estuary. Thus, this paper argues that the introduction of new fishing gear and method triggered the excessive fishing in coastal areas in Philippines...|$|R

50|$|The Boracay Island of the Philippines is a vivid island {{noted by}} long white sand beaches among the popular beach {{destinations}} such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia. Boracay {{can only be}} reached by ferry from Caticlan. SEAir serves up to 28 flights a day, each flight about as 35 minutes, from Manila to Caticlan Airport. Another way is through the Kalibo Airport {{on the other side}} of <b>Aklan</b> Island. <b>From</b> Kalibo, visitors take a two-hour (2-hour) ride to Caticlan. Three transportations get tourists from Kalibo to Catlican: Mini-vans, buses and other rental vehicles.|$|R

Boracay Island and its beaches have received awards from numerous travel publications and agencies.The island comprises the barangays of Manoc-Manoc, Balabag, and Yapak in the municipality of Malay, in Aklan Province. The island {{is administered by the}} Philippine Tourism Authority and the provincial government of <b>Aklan.</b> Apart <b>from</b> its white sand beaches, Boracay is also famous for being one of the world's top destinations for relaxation. It is also emerging among the top destinations for tranquility and nightlife.|$|R
50|$|As {{an island}} municipality, {{the only means}} to reach San Jose is via sea travel. There are several sea routes going to the island. From Manila or Batangas City, there are daily RORO trips going to Odiongan, Romblon or Caticlan in <b>Aklan</b> province. <b>From</b> Odiongan, there are jeepneys that take {{passengers}} to Santa Fe, where travellers can take pump boats or bancas going to San Jose. From Caticlan, there are bancas as well that take passengers to San Jose. The island is approximately a 45-minute boat ride from either Santa Fe or Caticlan. San Jose has a municipal port in Brgy. Poblacion where passengers and cargo disembark.|$|R

30|$|Research {{has focused}} mainly on MnPs <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus, {{probably}} because of their abundance in the genome of this species (Yao et al. 2017). MnPs <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus are important in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {{and are able to}} efficiently decolorize different groups of dye (Novotný et al. 2001; Kasinath et al. 2003; Baborová et al. 2006). Recent research indicated that two MnPs <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus CD 2 were able to degrade veratryl alcohol, a nonphenolic lignin compound (Qin et al. 2017). The ability of MnP purified <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus F 17 to degrade synthetic dyes has also been shown (Chen et al. 2015). However, {{little is known about the}} catalytic properties of DyP <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus. To the best of our knowledge, only a wild DyP <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus grown in liquid medium, has been isolated and characterized (Salvachúa et al. 2013). Thus, we selected a DyP gene (No. 8293, GenBank: MG 209114) <b>from</b> the <b>I.</b> lacteus F 17 genome and expressed it in Escherichia coli, and compared it with a MnP gene (No. 6398, GenBank: MG 209112) from the same genome. Any similarities and differences between the two enzymes in terms of their sequence homologies, molecular structures, biochemical and spectroscopic properties, as well as their ability to decolorize different types of dye, were investigated. The results of this study will further reveal the catalytic characteristics of DyPs <b>from</b> <b>I.</b> lacteus F 17 to provide a better understanding of the lignin degradation potential of this strain.|$|R
