5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble into two {{different}} holes and meet two different fates: Finn becomes the guest of the unstable King Huge (voiced by Jones), who insists that Finn remain with him <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> his idiosyncratic cuckoo clock; whereas Jake meets Seven (voiced by Isaak), a bear whose makeshift air raft has been falling down the hole for years. Eventually, {{it turns out that}} the hole Jake and Seven are falling through is the chimney to the kitchen where Finn is being held captive. As such, Jake is eventually able to save Finn.|$|E
500|$|Karan Grewal, {{who shared}} a suite with Cho at Harper Hall, {{reported}} that Cho [...] "would {{sit in a}} wood rocker by the window <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the lawn below". According to Grewal, [...] "Cho appeared to never go to class or read a book during his senior year," [...] adding that Cho just typed on his laptop, went to the dining hall and clipped his hair in the toilet, cleaning up the hair afterwards. Grewal also reported that he witnessed Cho riding his bicycle in circles {{in the parking lot}} of the dormitory.|$|E

500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> you and have that stupid grin on his face. He would make your skin crawl." ...|$|E
500|$|Vikings coach Dennis Green {{has been}} criticized for his {{decision}} to kneel on 3rd down and play for overtime instead of attempting to score before the end of regulation. Radio host Bob Sansevere, author of The Best Minnesota Sports Arguments, called it [...] "one of the all-time boneheaded decisions a coach has ever made in any sport." [...] Of Green's play call, Peter King of Sports Illustrated wrote, [...] "Minnesota coach Dennis Green did a great job this year, but if he doesn't wake up <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the ceiling {{in the next few days}} and say out loud: 'Boy, I screwed that one up,' then he's not being honest with himself." [...] Nonetheless, local Minneapolis newspaper Star Tribune has contended that taking a knee was the correct decision due to the performance of the Vikings' offense, whose struggles that day were also noted by Carter.|$|E
500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "Â¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa <b>and</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> her with an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone wants me I'll be in my room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{campaign}} is successful. Farley offers Ramshaw a Finster cigarette {{as they leave}} the office to celebrate, but the offer is declined. Farley {{is the only one}} who smokes.
