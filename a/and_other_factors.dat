5|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} a location in the galaxy as {{being a part of}} the galactic habitable zone, a variety of factors must be accounted for.

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>factors</b> can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense core region through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>factors.</b> All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are {{the leading cause of}} death worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>factors,</b> becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is a major cause of death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{have a high}} {{breeding}} rate. Under controlled breeding, {{they can}} be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering, {{as well as the}} abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control. In certain areas outside cats' native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>factors,</b> to the extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and {{may have contributed to the}} extinction of isolated island populations. Cats are thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds, and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.|$|E

Social support <b>and</b> <b>other</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> related to ESRD and its treatment were measured by patient self-reports of health interference with social activities, isolation, feeling like a burden, and support from family and dialy-sis staff. Cox regression and logistic regression were used to examine associations of baseline social support <b>and</b> <b>other</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> with all-cause mortality <b>and</b> with <b>other</b> measured outcomes at baseline, ad-justing for potential confounders.

5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, but more than 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years.

However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world.
