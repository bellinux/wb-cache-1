40|$|FRIDA (inFRared Imager and Dissector for the <b>Adaptative</b> <b>optics</b> {{system of}} the GTC) will be a NIR (1 - 2. 5 microns) imager and Integral Field Unit {{spectrograph}} to operate with the <b>Adaptative</b> <b>Optics</b> {{system of the}} 10. 4 m GTC telescope. FRIDA will offer broad and narrow band diffraction-limited imaging and integral field spectroscopy at low, intermediate and high spectral resolution. The Extragalactic Astrophysics and Astronomical Instrumentation group of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (GUAIX) is developing the Data Reduction Pipeline for FRIDA. Specific tools for converting output, reduced datacubes to the standard Euro 3 D FITS format will be developed, {{in order to allow}} users to exploit existing VO applications for analysis. FRIDA is to be commissioned on the telescope in 2011.

40|$|Observations of {{different}} star forming regions {{have been performed}} with the <b>adaptative</b> <b>optics</b> system (PUEO) at CHFT in order to detect binaries around lowmass stars (M ! 1 : 5 M fi). Companion star fraction are determined in the Pleiades and in a very young cluster, IC 348. Preliminary estimations are also presented for Praesepe and ff Per. All clusters show overall fractions and period distributions similar to the expectations from main sequence figures. We argue {{that the difference between}} these star forming regions and other young associations, like Taurus and Chameleon, are probably not due to time evolution, but that the formation initial conditions may {{have an impact on the}} final binary fraction, with the loosest associations forming more wide binaries (separations ?¸ 10 AU). 1. Introduction Various studies in the last ten years have shown that binarity is a very common property of low-mass main sequence (MS) stars: about 53 % of G-type stars and 42 % of M dwarfs are in fact multipl [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Aims: As a {{continuation}} of a previous work, in which we found strong evidence of massive molecular outflows toward a massive star-forming site, we present a new study of this region based on very high angular resolution observations {{with the aim of}} discovering the outflow-driven mechanism. Methods: Using near-IR data acquired with Gemini-NIRI at the broad H- and Ks-bands, we studied a region of 22 ´´ × 22 ´´ around the UCHii region G 045. 47 + 0. 05, a massive-star forming site at a distance of about 8 kpc. To image the source with the highest spatial resolution possible we employed the <b>adaptative</b> <b>optics</b> system ALTAIR, achieving an angular resolution of about 0. 15 arcsec. Results: We discovered a cone shaped nebula that has an opening angle of about 90 ° and extends eastward of the IR source 2 MASS J 19142564 + 1109283, which is very likely a massive young stellar object (MYSO). This morphology suggests a cavity that was cleared in the circumstellar material, and its emission may arise from scattered continuum light, warm dust, and probably also from emission lines from shock-excited gas. The nebula, which presents arc-like features, is connected with the IR source through a jet-like structure, which is aligned with the blueshifted CO outflow found in a previous study. The near-IR structure lies ~ 3 ´´ north of the radio continuum emission, revealing that it is not spatially coincident with the UCHii region. The observed morphology and structure of the near-IR nebula strongly suggest the presence of a precessing jet. We resolved the circumstellar environment (in scale of a thousand AU) of a distant MYSO, indeed one of the farthest currently known. Fil: Paron, Sergio Ariel.
