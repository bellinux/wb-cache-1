5|$|The {{station was}} granted the Freedom of the London Borough of Hillingdon on 19 March 1960, an honour {{allowing}} the station's personnel to march throughout the borough in uniform. On 1 November that year, the Queen's Colour Squadron of the RAF Regiment moved to Uxbridge and the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. After the war, {{the station was}} already home to the London <b>Area</b> <b>Control</b> Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton but remained under the parentage of RAF Uxbridge.|$|E

The Boeing did not break up, explode or plummet immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then leveled off at 16,424feet (5,006 m) (18:30–18:31UTC), rather than continue descending to 10,000 (3,000 m) as previously reported to Tokyo <b>Area</b> <b>Control</b> Center, continuing at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35UTC).|$|E
5|$|As of 20April 1942, {{operational}} {{authority over}} all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was {{invested in the}} newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under South West Pacific Area Command (SWPA). On 15May, Southern Area, which by then was considered too large, yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern <b>Area.</b> <b>Control</b> of maintenance units under Southern Area {{was transferred to the}} newly established No.4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne on 14September. September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA.

Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960.

25|$|The mid-air {{incident}} occurred as flight attendants began to serve drinks onboard Flight 907. JA8904's 'Traffic Collision Avoidance System' (TCAS) sounded 20minutes after its departure as the jet climbed towards 39,000 feet. The DC-10, JA8546, cruised at 37,000 feet. The pilots of both planes had received {{instructions from the}}ir TCAS, but Flight 907 received conflicting instructions from the flight controller at the Tokyo <b>Area</b> <b>Control</b> Center in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. Flight 907, headed by 40-year-old pilot , followed an order to descend issued by the flight controller while Flight 958, headed by pilot , descended as instructed by the TCAS, meaning that both planes remained on a collision course.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) {{took over}} Skattøra in 1945 and from 1947 it was {{designated}} a main air station. Until the military left in 1959, it hosted the 21 Transport Flight of Noorduyn Norseman transporters and the 333 Squadron with Consolidated PBY Catalina reconnaissance aircraft. It also hosted the <b>area</b> <b>control</b> center for Northern Norway until 1957. Civilian traffic commenced in 1946, first by DNL and later its successor Scandinavian Airlines System. Widerøe {{took over the}} scheduled flights in 1954, but withdrew in 1964 {{with the opening of}} Tromsø Airport, Langnes. Later operators at the airport included Helikopter Service from 1948 and Nor-Wing, and its successor Norving, from 1965. The control tower was closed in 1967 and the aerodrome abandoned in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Two-thirds of the {{building}} complex at the station was demolished {{in the remainder of}} 1945. This was done to secure building material for the reconstruction of Finnmark. For instance Gunnarnes Chapel is a former barracks built at Skattøra. Skattøra was the only naval air station of the Navy Air Service to resume use after the war. All other seaplane bases were jointly located with land airport. The Air Force decided in 1947 to make Skattøra one of its five main air stations—and the only one of these to be a water airport. The Air Force and the civilian aviation authorities determined that Norway would receive two <b>area</b> <b>control</b> centers for its air traffic control. One of these was located at Tromsø and located in the subterranean structure at Marielund. This also acted as a rescue coordination center. The fire station was converted to a joint control tower and weather station.|$|E
