40|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{recurring}} indication for caesarean section vaginal delivery in subsequent pregnancy is a “trial of scar,” with potentially serious implications for mother and baby. Labour under caudal analgesia was carefully supervised for 75 women with a surgically scarred uterus—due to lower segment section in 72, <b>abdominal</b> <b>hysterotomy</b> in one, and transcavity myomectomy in two. Every caesarean scar was assessed digitally during labour and every uterus was examined after delivery. Caudal analgesia provided a painless labour and delivery and made scar assessment easy. Controlled intravenous Syntocinon infusion was given to 25 patients. One scar dehiscence occurred early in labour and one in the second stage. Seventy mothers had 71 vaginal deliveries with one pair of twins and one breech. There was one stillbirth and no neonatal death. There were five repeat sections...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-seven placentae were {{obtained}} by <b>abdominal</b> <b>hysterotomy,</b> between the 10 th and 20 th weeks of pregnancy, from women who had had a thera-peutic abortion. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) in extracts from these placentae was assayed by a biological and a radioimmunological method. When the concentration and total amount of HCG in placentae {{was related to the}} sex of the foetus no significant difference between 'male' and 'female ' placentae was found. This is contrary to findings at term when there is a significant (P < 0 =. 05) difference in the concentration of HCG/g and/placenta in 'male ' and 'female ' placentae. The amount ofbio-logically active HCG in 'female ' placentae significantly increased but was unchanged in 'male ' placentae when the periods 10 =n- 0 and 37 =n- 1 weeks were compared. Similarly, the amount of immunologically active HCG in 'female ' placentae was unchanged but in 'male ' placentae it decreased. The possible reasons for the different results obtained with the biological and the radioimmunological assays are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that maternal interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) pretreatment and induction of fetal cortisol synthesis activates MAP kinases and thereby affects lung fluid absorption in preterm guinea pigs. Methods IL- 1 β was administered subcutaneously daily to timed-pregnant guinea pigs for three days. Fetuses were obtained by <b>abdominal</b> <b>hysterotomy</b> and instilled with isosmolar 5 % albumin into the lungs and lung fluid movement was measured over 1 h by mass balance. MAP kinase expression was measured by western blot. Results Lung fluid absorption was induced at 61 days (D) gestation and stimulated at 68 D gestation by IL- 1 β. Maternal IL- 1 β pretreatment upregulated ERK and upstream MEK expression at both 61 and 68 D gestation, albeit being much more pronounced at 61 D gestation. U 0126 instillation completely blocked IL- 1 β-induced lung fluid absorption as well as IL- 1 β-induced/stimulated ERK expression. Cortisol synthesis inhibition by metyrapone attenuated ERK expression and lung fluid absorption in IL- 1 β-pretreated fetal lungs. JNK expression after maternal IL- 1 β pretreatment remained unaffected at either gestation age. Conclusion These data implicate the ERK MAP kinase pathway as being important for IL- 1 β induction/stimulation of lung fluid absorption in fetal guinea pigs. </p...|$|E
50|$|Hysterotomy {{abortion}} {{is a form}} of abortion in which the uterus is opened through an abdominal incision and the fetus is removed, similar to a caesarean section, but requiring a smaller incision. As major <b>abdominal</b> surgery, <b>hysterotomy</b> is performed under general anaesthesia, and is only used in rare situations where less invasive procedures have failed or are medically inadvisable (such {{as in the case of}} placenta accreta).|$|R
