This benchmark is intended for testing data-based modeling techniques. The ultimate goal is the development of models to improve the forecast and control of environmental variables. Among the numerous challenges related to this framework, we point out the problem of occupancy estimation using information on CO$_ 2 $ concentration. This can be seen as a blind identification problem. For benchmarking purposes, we present two different identification approaches: a baseline overparametrization method and a kernel-based method.

40|$|AbstractNowadays the {{increasing}} trend to make buildings {{more and more}} energetically efficient leads to an improvement of the thermal performance of the elements such us walls, windows and doors, making the envelope a strong barrier between the indoor and outdoor environment, also for <b>air</b> <b>infiltrations.</b> If this circumstance results useful for energy consumption reduction, it constitutes a problem for indoor air quality and comfort. Mechanical ventilation systems are often provided, and, at the aim of abating the thermal (or cooling) loads linked to the inlet of air from the external environment, heat recovery systems {{became more and more}} popular; for high values of air mass flow treated, many national regulations make the installation of heat recovery systems compulsory. An experimental test bench was built at the Thermal Engineering Laboratory of the University of Perugia, aimed at evaluating the performance of air heat recovery devices. The first measurements were carried out on a commercial plate-type heat exchanger, made of polystyrene. This plastic material is characterized by a low value of thermal conductivity, but its easiness of workability allows to increase the heat exchange surface, overcoming also issues linked to the weight and the cost of the product. The flow-rates, the pressure drops, and all temperatures of interest for the heat exchanger were acquired. The energy efficiency index of the heat recovery system was assessed with several tests conducted with different boundary conditions of the indoor and outdoor ambient, as well as different air flow rates. Results were compared with data gathered from the manufacturer, highlighting the points of contact and the differences between the experimental outcomes and the company information sheet, providing further details that are commonly not available...|$|R

40|$|Water {{infiltration}} {{into the}} unsaturated zone {{especially in a}} shallow water table environment is affected by air compression ahead of the wetting front and air counterflow. Neglecting <b>air</b> compression in <b>infiltration</b> modeling can overestimate infiltration and infiltration rates, whereas not accounting for air counterflow can underestimate infiltration and infiltration rates due to unrealistic buildup of air pressure resistance ahead of the wetting front. A method, derived {{on the basis of}} the Green and Ampt (1911) infiltration model, is introduced to simulate air compression and <b>air</b> counterflow during <b>infiltration</b> into a shallow water table. The method retains the simplicity of the Green and Ampt (1911) model but adds the air pressure resistance term ahead of the wetting front. Infiltration equations are derived {{on the basis of the}} Green and Ampt (1911) and Sabeh’s (2004) infiltration model which accounts for air compression and air counterflow. The difference between this method and Sabeh’s (2004) model is that air counterflow, <b>air</b> compression, and <b>infiltration</b> are decoupled and updated with each wetting front increment whereas Sabeh’s (2004) method uses time step as a decoupling mechanism. Air compression ahead of the wetting front is predicted using the perfect gas law. Laboratory experiments showed that the introduced method is reasonably accurate when modeling cumulative infiltration values. Results of laboratory experiments were compared to results of the modeled infiltration methods: original Green and Ampt (1911) model and Green and Ampt with air compression and counterflow. The advantage of this new method is its simplicity. The new method uses parameters that are generally needed for modeling infiltration with the Green and Ampt (1911) approach. Disadvantages of the model are assumptions of the uniform water content and the uniform pressure. Another shortcoming of the model is that it does not account for air compression and air counterflow prior to ponding. Laboratory experiments described in this work and a proposed model can be further used for modeling and studying <b>infiltration</b> with <b>air</b> effects. In addition, this work can be of use to someone studying irrigation techniques of rice or other crops...|$|R
