40|$|A {{patented}} new {{growing medium}} (NGM), made of biodegradable polyurethane <b>agglomerated</b> <b>peat,</b> was developed. On a weight basis, {{it consists of}} water (80 %), peat (12 - 15 %), and aggregating polymers (5 - 8 %). The use of materials alternative to peat is under study. Among them, a promising one is bark fiber. Several plug shapes (also concerning seed niche) and sizes have been investigated over the time. A TFS-TP system was developed, consisting of plug units of the NGM, floating on a reusable polystyrene foam flat panel. Management in the greenhouse {{is similar to a}} standard TFS-TP system. Also more environmental-friendly alternatives to polystyrene foam panels are under study: made both of biodegradable foam polymers (BFP) or BFP-agglomerated paper/wood derivative...|$|E
