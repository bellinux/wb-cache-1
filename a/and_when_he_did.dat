5|$|Over the years, Stevens held several {{important}} NWP leadership positions, including Legislative Chairman and membership {{on the executive}} committee. In 1920, Alva Belmont {{was elected president of}} the NWP and Stevens served as Belmont’s personal assistant, even writing Belmont's autobiography. Belmont and Steven's relationship was contentious, but the younger Stevens accepted years of control by Belmont over many of her personal actions. Traveling to Europe with Belmont for work of the NWP, Belmont insisted that Steven's fiance could not join them <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Belmont removed to France without Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|Before {{arrival at}} the Ely Road, a small {{detachment}} of troops were ordered across the Hemp Field to enter the village from the east. The larger group then charged at a hard gallop down the Mill Street incline through to Main Street. The rioters were found making a stand in The George and Dragon near {{the west end of}} Station Road. The militia were called to the front when the rioters would not come out after being ordered to by Bate Dudley. Thomas South, shooting from a window, hit trooper Wallace in the forearm. The militia got the rioters out of the public house and assembled them in the street, surrounded by the troopers. Thomas Sindall attempted to take a musket from trooper William Porter but was not successful. Sindall ran away <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not stop after being called on to do so by Porter, he was shot through the back of the head. Thomas Sindall was killed; he was the only person known to be at both Downham Market and Littleport. The result of this shooting was to subdue the rest of the rioters. Those captured were taken to Ely gaol {{and the rest of the}} rioters were rounded up.|$|E

5|$|Justice David Josiah Brewer's {{death on}} March 28, 1910 gave Taft a second {{opportunity}} {{to fill a}} seat on the high court; he chose New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes. Taft told Hughes that should the chief justiceship fall vacant during his term, Hughes would be his likely choice for the center seat. The Senate quickly confirmed Hughes, but then Chief Justice Fuller died on July 4, 1910. Taft took five months to replace Fuller, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> it was with Justice Edward Douglass White, who became the first associate justice to be promoted to chief justice. According to Lurie, Taft, who still had hopes of being chief justice, may have been more willing to appoint an older man than he (White) than a younger one (Hughes), who might outlive him, as indeed Hughes did. To fill White's seat as associate justice, Taft appointed Willis Van Devanter of Wyoming, a federal appeals judge. By the time Taft nominated White and Van Devanter in December 1910, he had another seat to fill due to William Henry Moody's retirement because of illness; he named a Louisiana Democrat, Joseph R. Lamar, whom he had met while playing golf, and had subsequently learned had a good reputation as a judge.|$|E

25|$|Warren's biggest {{difficulty}} was the Jack the Ripper case. He was criticised {{for failing}} {{to track down the}} killer and faced press accusations that were frequently baseless. He was accused of failing to offer a reward for information, although in fact he supported the idea and it was blocked by the Home Office. He was accused of not putting enough police officers on the ground, whereas in fact Whitechapel was swamped with them.. He was accused of being more interested in uniformed policing than detective work, which was true, but failed to take into consideration the fact that he allowed his experienced detective officers to conduct their own affairs and rarely interfered in their operations.

25|$|The barracks {{was being}} guarded by three patrolling sentries with two {{watching}} the wall facing the town while a third soldier guarded back wall covering approximately 100 yards. The raid {{was supposed to}} have taken place at the changing of the guard but O'Broin had trouble securing a lorry and was forced to steal one. This caused a three-hour delay and, at 3:30 am, Boyce and 15 other men scaled the wall while the rest waited outside. Three of the men were armed with knives, assigned to neutralise the sentry on duty, and broke away from Boyce's group once inside the base. They headed towards an archway where the soldier was to supposed take shelter, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not, the three attacked him.

25|$|The Court of Arches {{finally took}} {{evidence}} on the case in May 1770, {{two years after the}} bishop who appointed Bowles, John Egerton, had left the see of Bangor. Richard Williams and John Thomas testified that Bowles had seldom conducted services at St Beuno's, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was only in English. Another witness, Henry Jones, testified that Bowles had conducted a service at St Beuno's no more than three times. Williams and Jones testified that soon afterwards Bowles tried to minister in Welsh, but his grasp of the language was so poor that none of the congregation could understand him. Several witnesses, including his own curate, declared that when Bowles tried to minister the sacraments at Holy Communion, his Welsh was so bad that many communicants either burst out laughing or had to stifle themselves to avoid doing so. Since then Bowles had but seldom attended St Beuno's, and had employed a Welsh-speaking perpetual curate, John Griffith, to officiate in his stead. Griffith testified that he never saw Bowles conduct a service at St Cwyfan's.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not believe}} that Congress {{contemplated}} that such a taxpayer, without risking criminal prosecution, could ignore the duties imposed upon him by the Internal Revenue Code and refuse to utilize the mechanisms provided by Congress to present his claims of invalidity to the courts and to abide by their decisions. There is no doubt that Cheek, from year to year, was free to pay the tax that the law purported to require, file for a refund and, if denied, present his claims of invalidity, constitutional or otherwise, to the courts. See 26 U.S.C. 7422. Also, without paying the tax, he could have challenged claims of tax deficiencies in the Tax Court, 6213, with the right to appeal to a higher court if unsuccessful. 7482(a)(1). Cheek took neither course in some years, <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> was unwilling to accept the outcome. As we see it, he is in no position to claim that his good-faith belief about the validity of the Internal Revenue Code negates willfulness or provides a defense to criminal prosecution under 7201 and 7203. Of course, Cheek was free in this very case to present his claims of invalidity and have them adjudicated, but, like defendants in criminal cases in other contexts who “willfully” refuse to comply with the duties placed upon them by the law, he must take the risk of being wrong.|$|E

500|$|A {{follow-up}} visit, in 1521, by Bishop Atwater's successor, John Longland, {{showed that}} things had not improved. Abbot Pescall rarely attended church services <b>and,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> he would often bring his jester who [...] "disturbed the services with his buffoonery". The Abbot's bad example had affected the canon's behaviour, who ate and drank at improper times, failed to attend services (an average of 11 of the 25 canons attended) and roamed freely outside the abbey: visiting the town's alehouses and frequently going hunting. Two canons were also accused of [...] "incontinence". This visit revealed the abbey was severely in debt, leading the Bishop to appoint two administrators {{to oversee the}} abbey's finances.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, the {{archaeologist}} John Charlton {{referred to}} Crawford as [...] "one {{of the pioneers}} of British archaeology this century", while nine years later Ascherson described him as [...] "beyond question {{one of the great}} figures of the 'modern' generation which transformed British archaeological practice and its institutions between 1918 and – say – 1955". Ascherson noted that Crawford's contributions to archaeology {{had little to do with}} archaeological theory and more to do with [...] "the institutions and tools... which he bequeathed to his profession", including Antiquity. Crawford devoted little time to interpreting the archaeological record, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so usually embraced functionalist interpretations, believing that people in traditional societies devoted almost all of their time to survival rather than behaving according to religious or symbolic concepts; in this he was typical of his time and was influenced by Marxist materialism.|$|E

The text of one song, The Long Whip, seems to have been lost completely as a result. Vaughan Williams knew that the texts of many of the songs he was preserving had been printed as broadsides and he sometimes used broadside texts to fill out his songs for publication. He did not bowdlerise the material he collected for publication, as some other collectors did, but was as much as they were forced to recognise the constraints of the time when it came to publishing [...] "unsuitable" [...] material. Sometimes too he failed to note singers' names or occupations.|$|E

His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press (some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay.

At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a [...] "slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence." [...] When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; [...] "he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them," [...] Nosanchuk recalled. Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described.|$|E
