50|$|Pinus cembra, {{also known}} as Swiss pine, Swiss stone pine or <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> or Austrian stone pine or just Stone pine, is a species of pine tree that grows in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains of central Europe, in Poland (Tatra Mountains), Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia (Tatra Mountains), Ukraine and Romania. It {{typically}} grows at 1,200 m to 2,300 m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is typically between 25 m and 35 m in height, and the trunk diameter can be up to 1.5 m. The species is long-lasting and can reach an age between 500 and 1000 years. However, it grows very slowly and it may take 30 years for the tree to reach 1.3 m.|$|E
40|$|Seed {{predation}} and dispersal are key {{processes in}} the survival and distribution of plant species. Many animals cache seeds for later consumption, and, failing to recover some of these seeds, act as seed dispersers, influencing post-dispersal seed and seedling survival. Both animal and plant benefit from scatterhoarding and natural selection of seed characteristics and adaptations of seed predators (and dispersers) {{is one of the}} most important examples of co-evolution and mutualism. We studied the producer – consumer <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) – red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) system in a subalpine forest in the Italian Alps. <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> produced large seed-crops (masting) at irregular intervals, followed by years with poor or moderate seed production. Squirrel density fluctuated in synchrony with the food resource, eliminating the time-lag normally present when resources are produced in pulses. In all years except 2009 (a mast-crop year), all <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> cones were harvested (their seeds consumed and/or cached) by September to late October by different species. Both squirrels and nutcrackers (Nucifraga caryocatactes) fed on seeds, and their relative pre-dispersal predation rates (on cones in the canopy) differed between years. Overall, nutcrackers consumed more seeds between July and October than squirrels, but in one year squirrels took the largest number of seeds. Pre-dispersal seed predation by squirrels tended to be lower in years with large seed-crop size and there was a positive correlation, over the entire study period, between density of recovered hoards and <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> seed-density of the previous year. We conclude that (i) squirrels and nutcrackers are important pre-dispersal seed predators and seeds dispersers; (ii) squirrels are also post-dispersal seed predators, and (iii) the proportion of cached seeds consumed by squirrels increased with the size of the <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> seed-crop, suggesting that red squirrel is a conditional mutualistic scatterhoarder of <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> seeds...|$|E

40|$|High {{altitude}} alpine {{ecosystems are}} likely to be highly sensitive to future climate change. Understanding long-term tree stand dynamics may be a key requirement for forecasting such changes. Here, we present a high resolution record of paleobotanical macroremains covering the last 11 700 years, from a small subalpine pond situated in the inner French Alps, at 2035 m a. s. l. The early presence of larch (Larix decidua), <b>arolla</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) and birch (Betula) at this elevation, just {{after the end of the}} Younger Dryas cold transition, suggests the occurrence of either glacial tree-refugia located nearby in the northwestern Alps, or a previously unrecorded early and rapid tree migration. The 8200 cal. BP cooling event is characterized by a rapid and limited expansion of mountain pine (Pinus mugo/uncinata type). Mixed stands of larch, birch and <b>arolla</b> <b>pine</b> established at 8300 cal. BP and were present through the mid Holocene. After the Holocene climatic optimum, at 5600 cal. BP, recurrent fires led to the development of highly dynamic and more diversified forests, with larch, birch, <b>arolla</b> <b>pine,</b> mountain pine and fir (Abies alba). Natural and anthropogenic disturbances, e. g., fires, avalanches, slash-and-burn and other agricultural practices, influenced subsequent vegetation until the last millennium when tree-pasture established around the lake. The data indicate that the vegetation was progressively dominated by open larch woodland from 4000 years ago, and was clearly established during the Middle Ages (1250 cal. BP) up to the nineteenth century, when land began to be abandoned. The modern vegetation, dominated by larch and <b>arolla</b> <b>pine</b> and resulting from land abandonment, tends to resemble the communities that occurred from 8300 to 4000 cal. BP, before the postulated anthropogenic alteration of subalpine forest ecosystems. The plant macroremains analysis provides a unique and precise record of stand-to-local vegetation composition and dynamics that can bridge paleoecology and forest management...|$|E
40|$|Hoarding {{patterns}} can {{be classified}} into two general types: scatter-hoarding and larder-hoarding, but there are intermediate types. Various factors affect hoarding patterns. Animals hoarding identical seeds in different habitats may use different hoarding patterns to adapt to habitat variation. We used a sample-plot investigation method to study cache features and recovery rate of seeds of <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) by Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in 2009 and 2010 in two subalpine forests with different tree-species composition in the Italian Alps. Hoarding patterns of red squirrels varied among habitats: the typical scatter-hoarding pattern with most caches including 2 - 6 seeds is found in spruce (Picea abies) dominated forest, while a combination of few large caches (≥ 10 seeds) and many small caches (less than 10 seeds) is found in <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> dominated forest. Consequently, average number of seeds/cache was higher in the latter habitat. Among five microhabitats, shrubs, grass, moss, fallen leaves, and stone, Eurasian red squirrels preferred fallen leaves and moss as hoarding substrate. Cache recovery investigation indicated that recovery rate was 62 % in spruce forest and only 21 % in <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine</b> forest. A lower availability of suitable hoarding microhabitat resulted in changes in hoarding patterns of red squirrels in Pinus cembra dominated forest. We suggest that the main factor influencing differences in recovery rate was a higher cone production per tree in Pinus cembra forest. Download the complete issue...|$|E
40|$|As an {{efficient}} seed-disperser, Eurasian nutcrackers (Nucifraga caryocatactes) generally consume and hoard mature, edible pine seeds for future use. In 2009, when the <b>Arolla</b> <b>pine,</b> Pinus. cembra, produced a mast-crop, we investigated cones discarded by nutcrackers. Most cones were only partly eaten and some mature seeds {{remained in the}} distal part. This was in contrast to years of lower seed production when nearly all seeds were harvested from the majority of cones. To determine whether nutcracker cone-discarding behaviour maximised intake rate, seed kernels and the aborted seeds rate were measured from the different cone parts. In 2009, seeds from cone-tops were on average 17...|$|E
40|$|The {{analyses}} of archaeobotanical assemblages recovered in recent excavations {{in the northern}} French Alps permit {{a better understanding of}} the way people managed plant resources in a mountain context during the Middle Neolithic (4500 – 3500 cal b. c.). The aim of this paper is to shed new light on the question of crop cultivation as well as wood gathering and management from the results of the new archaeobotanical investigations at “Le Chenet des Pierres” in Bozel (Savoie, France; 1, 000 m. a. s. l.). The study reveals the presence of cereals like einkorn (Triticum monococcum), emmer (T. dicoccum), naked wheat (T. aestivum/durum/turgidum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare/distichon). In addition wild fruits and nuts, probably gathered, such as hazelnuts (Corylus avellana), wild apples (Malus sylvestris), <b>arolla</b> <b>pine</b> kernels (Pinus cembra), sloes (Prunus spinosa) and raspberries (Rubus idaeus) were recorded. The anthracological analysis shows that the occupants exploited mostly a mixed oak forest, and the available woodland from the alluvial forest to the mountain areas. With the archaeobotanical study of “Le Chenet des Pierres” we also want to raise the question of crop cultivation in a mountain context. Although present data show that cultivation at higher altitudes is common, it is still difficult to demonstrate the inhabitants cultivated plants near their settlement during the Neolithic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Forecasting {{the effects}} of global changes on high {{altitude}} ecosystems requires {{an understanding of the}} longterm relationships between biota and forcing factors to identify resilience thresholds. Fire is a crucial forcing factor: both fuel build-up from land-abandonment in European mountains, and more droughts linked to global warming are likely to increase fire risks. Methods: To assess the vegetation response to fire on a millennium time-scale, we analyzed evidence of stand-to-local vegetation dynamics derived from sedimentary plant macroremains from two subalpine lakes. Paleobotanical reconstructions at high temporal resolution, together with a fire frequency reconstruction inferred from sedimentary charcoal, were analyzed by Superposed Epoch Analysis to model plant behavior before, during and after fire events. Principal Findings: We show that fuel build-up from <b>arolla</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus cembra) always precedes fires, which is immediately followed by a rapid increase of birch (Betula sp.), then by ericaceous species after 25 – 75 years, and by herbs after 50 – 100 years. European larch (Larix decidua), which is the natural co-dominant species of subalpine forests with Pinus cembra, is not sensitive to fire, while the abundance of Pinus cembra is altered within a 150 -year period after fires. A long-term trend in vegetation dynamics is apparent, wherein species that abound later in succession are the functional drivers, loading the environment with fuel for fires. This system can only be functional if fires are mainly driven by external factors (e. g. climate) ...|$|E
40|$|In a high {{altitude}} region {{such as the}} Silvretta Alps (Switzerland/Austria), past and extant settlement activities {{are known to have}} had large influences on the alpine flora and vegetation. The Silvretta Massif harbors more than 230 archaeological sites above 2000 m a. s. l. on a total area of 550 km 2, from the Mesolithic period to Modern Times, but received little attention in these matters up to recently. The Fimba Valley within the Silvretta area e with 47 known archaeological sites (6 prehistoric, 21 from the Medieval and/or Modern Times, 20 undated) located over an area of 62 km 2 e provides evidence of a broad range of former human presence, as well as peat records allowing the reconstruction of Holocene climatic change and anthropogenic impact on past vegetation. Here, we present a high resolution, multiproxy study (including pollen, cryptogam spores, and non-pollen palynomorphs) on a 177 -cm-long radiocarbon dated peat core from the Las Gondas Bog in the Fimba Valley (2363 m a. s. l.). Palynological evidence adds and confirms previous dendrochronological results, revealing extensive high Pinus cembra (<b>Arolla</b> <b>pine)</b> stands around the bog at 10, 400 cal BP and between ca. 8600 e 6700 cal. BP, more than 300 altitudinal meters above today’s timberline, and belonging therefore to the highest population known for Central Europe. In addition, our palaeoecological results correlate well with the archaeologically known human impact during the Neolithic, Iron Age and Medieval periods. The exploitation of alpine landscape resources (cultivation of cereals in the valleys) and livestock grazing (in the subalpine and alpine areas) has therefore a long tradition going back at least for 6200 years in the Silvretta region...|$|E
