5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} outside world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Following Martyn Woolford's {{departure}} from York, Brodie {{played on the}} left wing in the 1–0 away victory over Crawley Town on {{the opening day of}} the season. His first goal of the season came after being assisted by Simon Rusk in a 2–2 away draw with Northwich Victoria. After coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute, he was sent off in the 76th minute of a 3–1 away defeat against Wrexham on 7 October 2008, after initially being shown a yellow card for kicking the ball <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> receiving a second card for a tackle on Carl Tremarco, which resulted in him being suspended for York's match against Woking.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{automatic}} flushes {{solve the}} problems of previous approaches, and are common in new installations. A passive infrared sensor identifies when the urinal has been used, by detecting when someone has stood in front of it and moved <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> activates the flush. There usually is also a small override button, to allow optional manual flushing.|$|E

However, it was Mansell who made a mistake first, spinning off at the start of lap 10. He was out and Senna was World Champion for the third time.|$|E
25|$|Many {{membrane}} proteins are glycoproteins {{and can be}} purified by lectin affinity chromatography. Detergent-solubilized proteins can {{be allowed}} to bind to a chromatography resin that has been modified to have a covalently attached lectin. Proteins that do not bind to the lectin are washed <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> specifically bound glycoproteins can be eluted by adding {{a high concentration of}} a sugar that competes with the bound glycoproteins at the lectin binding site. Some lectins have high affinity binding to oligosaccharides of glycoproteins that is hard to compete with sugars, and bound glycoproteins need to be released by denaturing the lectin.|$|E
25|$|In retaliation, the Russo-Mongol army took {{dozens of}} captives and burned entire villages to the ground. Alexander fled to Novgorod, who turned him <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to Pskov, {{where he was}} made the prince, to escape capture by Ivan. Novgorod managed to avoid {{the wrath of the}} army for {{involving}} themselves with the prince by paying the Mongol horde two thousand silver hryvnias and providing them with many gifts. Meanwhile, Ivan and his allies demanded the extradition of Alexander from Pskov, and Metropolitan Theognostus of Kiev excommunicated the prince and all the people of Pskov from the church. In order to alleviate the threat of invasion from his host city, Alexander fled once again to Lithuania in 1329, where he would remain for over a year.|$|E

While standing on a chair {{in an attempt to}} reach the dollhouse, she falls and is knocked unconscious. Rachel Wheaton and Steve Rimbauer see her fall and attempt to render first aid. Meanwhile, {{on the other side of}} the house, Rose Red's windows and doors mysteriously open again. Emery Waterman, realizing that his mother's screams were not an illusion, rushes outside to look for his mother. He runs into Dr. Miller, who warns him to stay <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> flees. Emery chases Miller but cannot catch him, so he returns to Rose Red. Miller, continuing to frantically run around the grounds of the house, is found and attacked by the ghost of Kevin Bollinger.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1857, at {{an early}} stage in the Indian Mutiny, Lord Palmerston offered Campbell the command of all British forces in India. Promoted to the local rank of full general in India the same day, he left England the next day and reached Calcutta in August 1857. He {{relieved}} and then evacuated Lucknow in November 1857 and, after attacking and decisively defeating Tantia Tope at the Second Battle of Cawnpore in December 1857, he captured Lucknow again in March 1858. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full general on 14 May 1858 and raised to the peerage as Baron Clyde, of Clydesdale in Scotland on 3 August 1858. In Autumn 1858, faced with a further mutiny by the East India Company's European troops, who had not received their enlistment bounties, he used British troops to enforce discipline until the British Cabinet agreed some concessions. He continued in charge of the operations in India until all aspects of the revolt had died <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returned to England in June 1860.|$|E
25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted to be special. Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle <b>away,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E

500|$|This is an architecturally {{outstanding}} Neolithic chambered tomb on the Mainland of Orkney, Scotland – probably {{dating to}} the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island Hoy, about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just {{to the left of}} Ward Hill on Hoy. [...] Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m <b>away</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to [...] sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch {{at the base of the}} right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively – the Old Celtic festivals of Samhain and Imbolc. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines. [...] Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.|$|E
2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence.

To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E

2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process.

I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go <b>away.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
