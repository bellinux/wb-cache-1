40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{three-phase}} state estimation (SE) in power distribution network including on-load tap changers (OLTC) for voltage control. The OLTC tap positions are essentially discrete variables from the SE point of view. Estimation of these variables in SE presents a formidable challenge. The proposed methodology combines discrete and continuous state variables (voltage magnitudes, angles, and tap positions). A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) is applied to obtain the solution. The method is tested on standard IEEE 13 - and 123 -bus unbalanced test system models. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the network bus voltage magnitudes and angles, and discrete tap values. The HPSO-based tap estimation provides a more accurate estimation of losses in the network, which helps in fair <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> of losses in arriving at overall cost of electricity...|$|E

Twenty-five SI case studies were analysed under SIMPACT, a research project funded under the European Union’s 7 th Framework Programme. The results of this analysis demonstrated that SIs differ from traditional business models in the following ways: (i) they operate on paradoxical strategies; (ii) they cope with unfit legal frameworks; (iii) they are built on a divergence in the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost,</b> use and benefit; and (iv) they employ frugal innovation strategies. As social innovators often work under extreme resource scarcity, keeping the end game on creating a business model that drives meaningful change while being cost-effective and sustainable is king.

This paper is concerned with the development of an empirical rutting progression model using an experimental data set from WesTrack. The data used in this paper consist of an unbalanced panel data set with 860 observations. The salient features of the model specification are: 1) three properties of the mix are sufficient to model the performance of the asphalt concrete pavement accurately, 2) the model captures the effects of high air temperatures at WesTrack, and 3) the model predicts rut depths by adding predicted values of the increment of rut depth for each time period, which is particularly advantageous in a pavement management context. The three mix properties are a gradation index, which is obtained from the aggregate gradation, the voids filled with asphalt obtained for the construction mix in the Superpave gyratory compactor, and the initial in-place air voids. The specified model is non-linear in the variables and the parameters, and is estimated using a random effects specification to account for unobserved heterogeneity.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to analyse the {{possibilities}} and problems facing a privatised work injury insurance. This discussion includes the element of premium differentiation. Todays´ Swedish social insurance system is ineffectively formed. The costs have dramatically increased during the 1990 ´s. The Swedish government is now {{looking for ways to}} improve the efficiency of the system. The work injury insurance has not followed this pattern of increased costs. On the other hand there are reasons to believe that many of the costs derived from work injuries have been allocated o burden other social insurance. This is one of the distortions in which the system results. With focus on a privately financed work injury insurance the aim is to increase the fairness of the social insurance system. The <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> burdens on the right party is included in this aim. It is believed that the motive of prevention for an injury to occur and the efforts in rehabilitation will improve when introducing a private work injury insurance. More responsibility is given to the insured, i. e. the employer. Private insurance companies can specialise and are, on a competitive market, able to keep the premiums on a fair price level. The conclusion is that efficiency can, in several aspects, increase when introducing a privately financed work injury insurance...|$|E

40|$|Properly {{specified}} pavement deterioration {{models are}} an important input for the efficient management of pavements, the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> responsibilities to various vehicle classes for {{their use of the}} highway system, and the design of pavement structures. However, most empirical deterioration progression models developed to date have had limited success. This paper is concerned with the development of an empirical rutting progression model using experimental data. The data used in this paper comprise an unbalanced panel data set with more than 14, 000 observations taken from the AASHO Road Test. The salient features of the model specification are (1) the model eschews conventional (predefined) axle load equivalencies and structural numbers in favor of relationships determined entirely by the data itself; (2) a thawing index variable has been incorporated to capture the effects of the environmental factors in the AASHO Road Test; and (3) the model predicts incremental changes in rut depth, which is particularly advantageous in a pavement management context. The specified model is nonlinear in the variables and the parameters and is estimated using both fixed-effects and random-effects specifications to account for unobserved heterogeneity. The estimation results show that the model replicates the pavement behavior well, that the inclusion of an environmental variable is important to avoid biases in other parameters, and that the size of the unobserved heterogeneity is significant. It is also found that interactions between some parameters in the nonlinear specification leads to significant differences between parameter estimates among the two wheel paths rutting models...|$|E

Thus in practice, majority of distribution tariffs in the world price electricity through traditional averaging. This {{is because of the}} difficulties in implementation of advanced pricing strategies mainly complexity, caused by high density of nodes compared to transmission networks and lack of advanced metering infrastructure. This thesis analyzes the question of allocating infrastructure of fixed cost, leading to a more absolute solution. It proposes a time based pricing model (TBPM) which can be easily adopted in distribution networks and transmission networks. Further this study also includes the recovery of cost of losses which is more in line with proposed costing of infrastructure. The proposed TBPM is cost causation based and suitable for distribution networks. TBPM recovers the costs by allocating to either active energy or both active and orreactive energies. It works out a price in a particular time interval basis such ashourly basis etc. It comprises of two components  A time based pricing per energy to allocate fixed cost which is derived from incremental fixed cost per energy unit.  <b>Allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> of losses pertaining to the network at the time of delivery per energy.

40|$|Purpose – The {{literature}} on activity-based costing (ABC) {{that deals with}} the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> indirect purchasing <b>costs</b> primarily draws on a transactional approach to purchasing. This presents a problem, since {{a large share of}} purchasing takes place within relationships. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to point out complexities in applying ABC to indirect purchasing costs, when purchasing takes place within long-term relationships. The interaction model is used as a framework. Design/methodology/approach – A case study is conducted on a first-tier supplier in the Swedish automotive industry to illustrate real-life purchasing practices and to point out subsequent difficulties in applying ABC principles. This firm is selected because efforts have simultaneously been undertaken to employ supplier relationship management (SRM) and to implement costing techniques. About 23 interviews were conducted and approximately 31 hours of interview data were collected. Findings – The case shows that many functions tend to be involved in exchange within long-term relationships. This generates additional purchasing-related costs not previously recognized in the costing literature. It also leads to difficulties in allocating these costs. Originality/value – Complexities when implementing ABC are presented, concerning: <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> relating to SRM; <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> pertaining both to transactions and to relationships; less apparent cost drivers due to involvement of many functions in exchanges; and cost allocation over time.
