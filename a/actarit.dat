50|$|<b>Actarit</b> is an disease-modifying {{antirheumatic}} drug (DMARD) {{developed in}} Japan {{for use in}} rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method based on {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} with ultraviolet detection (245 nm) was developed for the determination of <b>actarit</b> in human plasma. Coumarin {{was used as an}} internal standard. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a C 8 column using a mobile phase of methanol: 1 % acetic acid (50 - 50, v/v) with a flow rate of 1. 0 ml/min. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0. 1 – 4. 0 μg/ml (r 2 > 0. 99) and the lower limit of quantification was 0. 1 μg/ml. The method was validated for sensitivity, accuracy, precision, recovery and stability. The method was used to determine the concentration-time profiles of <b>actarit</b> in the plasma following oral administration of 100 mg <b>actarit</b> tablets...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of the drug <b>actarit</b> was studied under different stress conditions like hydrolysis (acid, alkaline and neutral), oxidation, photolysis and thermal degradation as recommended by International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines. Drug {{was found to be}} unstable in acidic, basic and photolytic conditions and produced a common degradation product while oxidative stress condition produced three additional degradation products. Drug was impassive to neutral hydrolysis, dry thermal and accelerated stability conditions. Degradation products were identified, isolated and characterized by different spectroscopic analyses. Drug and the degradation products were synthesized by a new route using green chemistry. The chromatographic separation of the drug and its impurities was achieved in a phenomenex luna C 18 column employing a step gradient elution by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and mass spectrometry detectors (HPLCâPDAâMS). A specific and sensitive stability-indicating assay method for the simultaneous determination of the drug <b>actarit,</b> its process related impurities and degradation products was developed and validated.

40|$|This {{study used}} <b>actarit</b> (ACT), an {{antirheumatic}} drug, {{to examine the}} molecular interaction of ACT and γ-CD in a solid state {{as a result of}} cogrinding or freeze-drying and it assessed the dissolution of ACT. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that coground ACT and γ-CD at molar ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 3 and freeze-dried ACT and γ-CD at molar ratios of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 lacked an endothermic peak due to melting of ACT crystals. Thus, coground ACT and γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 had molecular interaction, as did freeze-dried ACT and γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 1. Powder x-ray diffraction revealed that coground and humidified ACT and γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 2 produced a characteristic diffraction peak at 2 θ = 15. 2 ° and 16. 5 ° due to the cage structure of γ-CD. In addition, freeze-dried ACT and γ-CD at a molar ratio of 1 : 1 that had been humidified produced a diffraction peak at 2 θ = 6. 0 ° and 15. 9 ° characteristic of a hexagonal structure with head-to-head channels due to γ-CD. Assessment of dissolution revealed that ground mixtures (GMs) and freeze-dried mixtures had improved dissolution of ACT compared to ACT, ground ACT alone, and physical mixtures. The mechanism for this is presumably the result of molecular interaction in a solid state or molecular interaction in an aqueous solution. 1 H– 1 H NOESY NMR spectra suggested that in a GM of ACT and γ-CD the benzene ring and methyl group of ACT partially enter the CD cavity. In addition, spectra for freeze-dried ACT and γ-CD suggested that protons of the methylene group of ACT and the benzene ring of ACT partially enter the CD cavity. These findings indicate that ACT and γ-CD inclusion complexes feature different forms of inclusion depending on how they are prepared, e. g., cogrinding or freeze-drying. Findings also indicated that selection of a method of preparation may {{play a major role in}} drug development...|$|E
