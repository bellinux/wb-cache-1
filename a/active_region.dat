The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically <b>active</b> <b>region</b> in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year.

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2013, a {{broad and}} diffuse {{cyclonic}} disturbance developed over eastern Mexico and northern Central America, incorporating the remnants of easternPacific Hurricane Barbara. As a tropical wave approached from the east, an inverted trough developed on {{the northern edge of}} the <b>active</b> <b>region</b> on June2, setting the stage for the formation of a weak surface low pressure system over the southern Gulf of Mexico the next day. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system in their Tropical Weather Outlooks, bulletins issued every six hours regarding the probability of tropical cyclone formation within 48hours. A nearby upper trough created unfavorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis, subjecting the low to wind shear and abundant dry air that kept it indistinct and disorganized. On June5, the environment became less hostile, and the system began to improve in structure.|$|E
40|$|Using {{high-resolution}} ring analysis (HRRA) we deduce subsurface flows within magnetic <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> {{and within}} quiet sun. With this procedure we {{are capable of}} measuring flows with a horizontal spatial resolution of 2 ◦ in heliographic angle (or roughly 20 Mm). From the resulting flow fields we deduce mean inflow rates into <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> mean circulation speeds around <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> and probability density functions (PDFs) of properties of the flow field. These analyses indicate that <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> have a zonal velocity that exceeds that of quiet sun at the same latitude by 20 m s − 1, yet <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> advect poleward {{at the same rate}} as quiet sun. We also find that almost all <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> possess a mean inflow (20 – 30 m s − 1) and a cyclonic circulation (≈ 5 m s − 1) at their peripheries, whereas their cores, where the sunspots are located, are zones of strong anticyclonic outflow (≈ 50 m s − 1). From the PDFs, we find that <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> modify the structure of convection with a scale greater than that of supergranulation. Instead of possessing an asymmetry between inflows and outflows (with a larger percentage of the surface occupied by outflows), as is seen in quiet sun, <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> possess symmetric distributions...|$|R

All the <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> with dark X-ray gaps at the proper place and with the correct polarity predicted by global potential extrapolation of photospheric magnetic fields are shown to be old <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> indicating that field opening is accomplished only in a late phase of active-region development.

40|$|Interplanetary {{scintillation}} {{measurements of}} the disturbance factor, g, from October 1991 to October 1992 are used to construct synoptic Carrington maps. These maps, which show {{the structure of the}} quiet solar wind, are compared with X-ray Carrington maps from the Yohkoh Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) instrument. For the period studied the global structure outlined by (weakly) enhanced g-values apparent in the interplanetary scintillation (IPS) maps tend to match the <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> (as shown in the X-ray maps) significantly better than the heliospheric current sheet. Contrary to traditional opinion, which views <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> as magnetically closed structures that do not have any significant impact on the solar wind flow, our results suggest that density fluctuations in the solar wind are significantly enhanced over <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> These results support the suggestion by Uchida et al.

As expected from earlier results, the f- and p-mode frequencies of high-degree modes are found to be signiÐcantly larger in magnetically <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition, we Ðnd that the power in both f-and p-modes is lower in <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> while the widths of the peaks are larger, indicating smaller life-times. We also Ðnd that the oscillation modes are more asymmetric in <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> than those in quiet regions, indicating that modes in <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> are excited closer to the surface.

40|$|The spatial {{inhomogeneity}} of {{the distribution}} of coronal mass ejection (CME) occurrences in the solar atmosphere could provide a tool to estimate the longitudinal position of the most probable CME-capable <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> in the Sun. The anomaly in the longitudinal distribution of <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> themselves {{is often referred to as}} active longitude (AL). In order to reveal the connection between the AL and CME spatial occurrences, here we investigate the morphological properties of <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> The first morphological property studied is the separateness parameter, which is able to characterise the probability of the occurrence of an energetic event, such as solar flare or CME. The second morphological property is the sunspot tilt angle. The tilt angle of sunspot groups allows us to estimate the helicity of <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> The increased helicity leads to a more complex built-up of the magnetic structure and also can cause CME eruption. We found that the most complex <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> appear near to the AL and the AL itself is associated with the most tilted <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> Therefore, the number of CME occurrences is higher within the AL. The origin of the fast CMEs is also found to be associated with this region. We concluded that the source of the most probably CME-capable <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> is at the AL. By applying this method we can potentially forecast a flare and/or CME source several Carrington rotations in advance. This finding also provides new information for solar dynamo modelling...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this work is to image solar {{far-side}} <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> using acoustic signals with three skips and {{improve the quality of}} existing images. The mapping of far-side <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> was first made possible using the helioseismic holography technique by use of four-skip acoustic signals. The quality of far-side images was later improved with the combination of four- and fiveskip signals using the time-distance helioseismology technique. In this work, we explore the possibility of making three-skip far-side images of <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> and improving the image quality by combining the three-skip images with the images obtained from existing techniques. A new method of combining images is proposed that increases the signal-to-noise ratio and reduces the appearance of spurious features.

25|$|Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers, or VECSELs, {{are similar}} to VCSELs.

As a result, the cavity includes a free-space region. A typical distance from the diode to the external mirror would be 1cm.|$|E
25|$|Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) {{have the}} optical cavity axis along the {{direction}} of current flow rather than perpendicular to the current flow as in conventional laser diodes. The <b>active</b> <b>region</b> length is very short compared with the lateral dimensions so that the radiation emerges {{from the surface of}} the cavity rather than from its edge as shown in the figure.

25|$|The <b>active</b> <b>region</b> of {{an organic}} device {{consists}} of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor.

The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.|$|E

The movies show ubiquitous expansions above the <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> with velocities in the range of a few to a few tens km/s. The expansion appears to preserve the overall structure of the active-region corona. This finding of almost continual expansion of the active-region corona may affect some of the basic ideas concerning <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> {{as well as those of}} the mass-loss from the Sun and Sunlike stars...|$|R
40|$|Using solar vector magnetograms of {{the highest}} {{available}} spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio we perform a detailed study of electric current patterns in two solar active regions: a flaring/eruptive, and a flare-quiet one. We aim to determine whether <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> inject non-neutralized (net) electric currents in the solar atmosphere, responding to a debate initiated nearly two decades ago that remains inconclusive. We find that well-formed, intense magnetic polarity inversion lines (PILs) within <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> are the only photospheric magnetic structures that support significant net current. More intense PILs seem to imply stronger non-neutralized current patterns per polarity. This finding revises previous works that claim frequent injections of intense non-neutralized currents by most <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> appearing in the solar disk but also works that altogether rule out injection of non-neutralized currents. In agreement with previous studies, we also find that magnetically isolated <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> remain globally current-balanced. In addition, we confirm and quantify the preference of a given magnetic polarity to follow a given sense of electric currents, indicating a dominant sense of twist in <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> This coherence effect is more pronounced in more compact <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> with stronger PILs and must be of sub-photospheric origin. Our results yield a natural explanation of the Lorentz force, invariably generating velocity and magnetic shear along strong PILs, thus setting a physical context for the observed pre-eruption evolution in solar <b>active</b> <b>regions.</b> Comment: 41 pp, 9 Figures, ApJ, in press - Please notice that the resolution of some figures has been degraded due to size consideration...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{intended}} to reveal the differential isoesterase expression in leaves and roots of Vigna unguiculata L. in response to saline stress. Influence of NaCl (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 %) on seedlings of Vigna unguiculata L. was analyzed. The seedlings were grown in the centre {{for a period of}} 30 days. The randomly collected whole plants were used as a source for isoesterase isolation. The seedlings showed the maximum tolerance up to 10 % of NaCl. The Poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by Anbalagan method. The staining and fixation of the enzyme was performed by the Sadasivam and Manickam method. Seedlings treated with various concentrations of NaCl showed different banding profile based on the concentration (0 - 10 %) and duration (5 - 30 days) of salt treatment as follows: 32 bands with five <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> 56 bands with eight <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> 102 bands with eight <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> 47 bands with seven <b>active</b> <b>regions,</b> 64 bands with nine <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> and 84 bands with nine <b>active</b> <b>regions</b> on 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th day respectively.

25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another {{way to look at}} it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves in parts of the Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically <b>active</b> <b>region</b> evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which is important to understand large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|In an {{n-channel}} 'depletion-mode' device, {{a negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the <b>active</b> <b>region</b> expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called 'pinch-off', and the voltage at which it occurs is called the 'pinch-off voltage'. Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E

This correlation implies that magnetic helicity, besides free magnetic energy, may be an essential ingredient for major solar eruptions.

25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The <b>active</b> <b>region</b> {{of the laser}} diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower threshold current and higher efficiency.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most <b>active</b> <b>region</b> for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|E
