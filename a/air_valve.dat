25|$|After the accident, {{investigators}} {{recovered a}} partially burned {{copy of the}} safety instructions for loading HTP torpedoes, but the instructions were for a significantly different type of torpedo and failed to include essential steps for testing an <b>air</b> <b>valve.</b> The 7th Division, 1st Submarine Flotilla never inspected the Kursks crew's qualifications and readiness to fire HTP torpedoes. Kursks crew had no prior experience with and had not been trained in handling or firing HTP-powered torpedoes. Ryazantsev believed that due to their inexperience and lack of training, compounded by incomplete inspections and oversight, and because Kursks crew followed faulty instructions when loading the practice torpedo, they set off {{a chain of events}} that led to the explosion. Ryazantsev asserted that signatures on the records documenting that the sailors had been trained in handling and firing HTP torpedoes had been faked. He stated that the warhead fuses on combat torpedoes 1, 3, 5, and 6 were set off when the first compartment collapsed after striking the sea bottom.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the emergency dive at about 13:40, Waddle invited {{two of the}} civilian guests, John Hall, CEO of a Texas oil company, and Jack Clary, a free-lance sports writer from Massachusetts, to operate the controls for the emergency main ballast blow. Clary sat in the helmsman's chair and Hall stood at the high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> levers, under close supervision by Greeneville crewmen. [...] After the two civilians had taken their positions, at 13:42:25 Waddle ordered the maneuver executed, and they threw the control levers as instructed. [...] The submarine began its rapid ascent toward the surface.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the limited}} fuel allowance, the cars were towed to the start line by horses. The first car, a Rolls-Royce being driven by Charles Rolls, started at 9am, and the {{following}} 41 cars were released at one minute intervals. Due to the fuel-saving nature of the event most of the drivers began the race by letting their car coast down the initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear. Early on the first lap of the race Rolls heard a crunching noise from his gear box and the car stopped. He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at it happening in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> bent, causing his engine to overheat. Before the race Rolls and Arnott had been two of the favourites, and The Automobile magazine said that [...] "this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from the success of the race." ...|$|E

5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> is linked to metering rods which are raised as the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|E

The lower legs are different as the different brake disk diameter used on the two models require the mounting points to be different.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{regulate}} airflow between cavities. Airflow {{occurs when}} an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> {{is open and}} there is a pressure difference between the connecting cavities. When an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> is closed, there is no airflow. The air valves are the vocal folds (the glottis), which regulate between the supraglottal and subglottal cavities, the velopharyngeal port, which regulates between the oral and nasal cavities, the tongue, which regulates between the oral cavity and the atmosphere, and the lips, which also regulate between the oral cavity and the atmosphere. Like the pistons, the air valves are also controlled by various muscles.|$|E

According to the accident report, [...] "The aircraft was not Ô¨Åtted with a high cabin altitude aural warning device, nor was it required to be."

40|$|The {{emptying}} {{procedure is}} a common operation that engineers have to face in pipelines. This generates subatmospheric pressure caused by the expansion of air pockets, which can produce {{the collapse of the}} system depending on the conditions of the installation. To avoid this problem, engineers have to install <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> in pipelines. However, if <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are not adequately designed, then the risk in pipelines continues. In this research, a mathematical model is developed to simulate an emptying process in pipelines {{that can be used for}} planning this type of operation. The one-dimensional proposed model analyzes the water phase propagation by a new rigid model and the air pockets effect using thermodynamic formulations. The proposed model is validated through measurements of the air pocket absolute pressure, the water velocity and the length of the emptying columns in an experimental facility. Results show that the proposed model can accurately predict the hydraulic characteristic variables...|$|R
