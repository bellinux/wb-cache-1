5|$|Having a green thumb. To be passionate <b>about</b> <b>or</b> talented at gardening. The {{expression}} was popularized beginning in 1925 by a BBC gardening program.|$|E
5|$|Forests make up <b>about</b> , <b>or</b> 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests {{consist of}} pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information <b>about,</b> <b>or</b> when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution was unclear and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
50|$|The Melanotaenia pygmaea {{is known}} to reach the maximum {{recorded}} length of <b>about</b> 5.5 centimeters <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 2.1 inches as an unsexed male. A female can reach the maximum recorded length of <b>about</b> 3.5 centimeters <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 1.37 inches. The common length of these species is <b>about</b> 4 centimeters <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 1.57 inches.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} represents work produced between September of 2014 and April of 2016. These are poems <b>about</b> structure. <b>Or</b> <b>about</b> difference. <b>Or</b> <b>about</b> love. <b>Or</b> {{they are}} an attempt to decipher what it can feel like in 2016, in the lonelinesses and in the solidarities that emerge in the apparent collapse of utopian possibility, in the efforts at its reconstruction, and {{in the search for}} the next rupture...|$|R
50|$|The host is Alari Kivisaar. The prizes {{originally}} {{went from}} {{as little as}} 10 senti (<b>about</b> €0.006 <b>or</b> $0.01) to as big as 250,000 Estonian krooni (<b>about</b> €16,000 <b>or</b> $21,000), but the money tree was changed in August 2007 and the prizes went from 1 sent (<b>about</b> €0.0006 <b>or</b> $0.001) to 1,000,000 krooni (<b>about</b> €63,900 <b>or</b> $85,000). The set {{is very similar to}} the US counterpart.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} table presents global {{sales of}} the top selling highway-capable electric cars and light utility vehicles produced between 2008 and December 2016.

5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting <b>about,</b> <b>or</b> after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E
5|$|Other media {{based on}} the game has been released. A novelization was {{published}} by Enterbrain in two parts: Remember 11 Ue Cocoro-hen on April 1, 2004, and Remember 11 Shita Satoru-hen on June 1, 2004. A music album with the game's soundtrack was released on March 24, 2004, by Scitron, with the title Remember 11: The Age of Infinity - Sound Collection. Another album, which features songs with vocals <b>about</b> <b>or</b> inspired by the game, was released with the title Remember 11: The Age of Infinity - Vocal Collection on September 23, 2004, also by Scitron. Scitron also released a drama CD {{based on the}} game on May 19, 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Platanichthys platana {{can reach}} the maximum {{recorded}} length of <b>about</b> 6.7 centimeters <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 2.63 inches as an unsexed male. The common length of this species is <b>about</b> 5 centimeters <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 1.96 inches.|$|R
50|$|Oberägeri has an area, , of 36.2 km2. Of this area, 0.3 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 0.8% is {{occupied}} with buildings and 1.04 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 2.9% is roads <b>or</b> transportation infrastructure. <b>About</b> a third <b>or</b> 12.24 km2 {{is used for}} agriculture, while 0.71 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 2.0% is used for small gardens. Forests or other wooded areas cover 13.53 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 37.4% of the municipality. Of the rest, 6.33 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 17.5% is covered with water, including the Ägerisee, and 2.07 km2 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 5.7% is marsh or moorland.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} higher culture. I know that culture. I would not set any man free for it if I could help it. The effect {{of it on}} the rich men who are free for it is so horrible that it is worse {{than any of the other}} amusements of the millionaire--worse than gambling, worse even than philanthropy. It means {{thinking}} the smallest poet in Belgium greater than the greatest poet of England. It means losing every democratic sympathy. It means being unable to talk to a navvy <b>about</b> sport, <b>or</b> <b>about</b> beer, <b>or</b> <b>about</b> the Bible, <b>or</b> <b>about</b> the Derby, <b>or</b> <b>about</b> patriotism, <b>or</b> <b>about</b> anything whatever that he, the navvy, wants to talk about. It means taking literature seriously, a very amateurish thing to do. It means pardoning indecency only when it is gloomy indecency. Its disciples will call a spade a spade; but only when it is a grave-digger's spade. The higher culture is sad, cheap, impudent, unkind, without honesty and without ease. In short, it is [...] "high." [...] That abominable word (also applied to game) admirably describes it.|$|R
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking <b>about</b> <b>or</b> attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was <b>about,</b> <b>or</b> what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (<b>about)</b> <b>or</b> be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move <b>about,</b> <b>or</b> during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E

5000|$|More recent {{measurements}} seem {{to point}} to more encouraging values for the α-sticking probability, finding the α-sticking probability to be <b>about</b> 0.5% (<b>or</b> perhaps even <b>about</b> 0.4% <b>or</b> 0.3%), which could mean as many as <b>about</b> 200 (<b>or</b> perhaps even <b>about</b> 250 <b>or</b> <b>about</b> 333) muon-catalyzed d-t fusions per muon. [...] Indeed, the team led by Steven E. Jones achieved 150 d-t fusions per muon (average) at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. [...] Unfortunately, 200 (or 250 or even 333) muon-catalyzed d-t fusions per muon is still not enough to reach break-even. Even with break-even, the conversion efficiency from thermal energy to electrical energy is only <b>about</b> 40% <b>or</b> so, further limiting viability. The best recent estimates of the electrical [...] "energy cost" [...] per muon is about [...] with accelerators that are (coincidentally) about 40% efficient at transforming electrical energy from the power grid into acceleration of the deuterons.|$|R
