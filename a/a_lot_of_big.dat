500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} episode 6.8/10, {{explaining}} {{that after the}} premiere's [...] "exciting, new direction" [...] of an episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] helped Lost [...] "take a step back [...] delivers nothing new or substantial". He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and [...] "a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as [...] "the only compelling scene in the whole episode". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining [...] "A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on-island plot." [...] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing [...] "it felt appropriate for Losts third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others {{was a big part}} of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin have had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> issues in their marriage' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point." ...|$|E

In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily." [...] Her acting coach advised her to learn the lines ahead of time so that she would [...] "really understood what [...] was talking about, it would come through a little more true." [...] MacFarlane commented on this, saying, [...] "She made an effort , so let me just put it that way." [...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E

Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the entry [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "visually captivating", particularly praising the installment's [...] "use {{of light and}} dark symbolism". Ultimately, he noted that [...] "it's good to once again see Mulder and Scully temporarily set free from the show's overarching conspiracy." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "there were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big,</b> big things going on in this ep , starting with Millenniums ace profiler Frank Black [...] reluctantly helping Mulder and Scully solve the apparent suicides of four FBI agents." [...] Rosell ultimately concluded that the reason the episode was a success was due to Mulder and Scully's kiss, a moment he called [...] "inevitable" [...] although he did note that [...] "many think [...] really signaled the beginning of the end." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review and called it [...] "highly entertaining" [...] and [...] "cause for celebration". He noted that, while he had never seen an episode of Millennium, the series mythology and story-arcs [...] "integrated seamlessly into this episode" [...] in a way that non-Millennium fans could still enjoy it. John Drake of Xposé considered the episode [...] "excellent" [...] and rated it 5 stars out of 5. Drake commended Lance Henriksen's performance, saying that [...] "not only provides continuity with Millennium, but adds a new dimension as Frank tries to leave the wreckage of his professional life behind". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". He called the entry [...] "tired" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "both too ambitious and not epic enough" [...] to bring closure to Millennium. Furthermore, he felt that the story's basic plot was too confusing and almost laughable. Despite this, he enjoyed Johnson's role as the villain, calling him [...] "interesting", and he wrote that the scene with Mulder and Black in the cellar was [...] "kind of cool" [...] because of the [...] "creepy zombie sequences".|$|E

2500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, observing the chemistry between Spears and Azalea {{as well as}} praising Spears's dancing and noting a nod to her earlier music videos. Mike Wass for Idolator wrote, [...] "Yes, it lifts product placement to previously unimagined heights and I can’t see an Academy Award in either diva’s future — but it’s {{a hell of a}} lot of fun. And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. There’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E

While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred {{to be on the}} stage with the actors instead of [...] "behind glass" [...] in a control room, which he describes as [...] "the norm" [...] while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, Rocko's Modern Life [...] "skewed kind of older". Murray noted, [...] "There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> kids out there. People went to see 'Roger Rabbit' and saw all these characters they'd grown up with and said, 'Yeah, why don't they have something like that anymore?'" [...] When he began producing Rocko, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was [...] "driving me crazy". This led him to allow for other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko's Modern Life production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg's first job in the animation business as a director.|$|E
