40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen the {{construction}} of many (high-rise) double facade (DF) buildings, for which the glazing is mounted in a pair steel or aluminium frames separated by a large cavity. In many cases, a key aspect of this system is the improved acoustic performance compared with single facades. Therefore, it has become eminent to understand the acoustic properties of DF. It also seemed that a crucial need had arisen {{to be able to}} predict the acoustic performances of DF <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> stage (as is already possible from a thermal point of view). In <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> stage of a project the project managers are dealing with large amounts (typically more than 10. 000 m²) of glazing {{to be used in the}} facade. The choice of a particular type of glazing has an important impact on the total cost of the building. In the years before many decisions led to over-dimensioning of the glass types due to a lack of knowledge, which obviously led to higher building costs, leaving economic optimisation out of the loop. This crucial factor led to the research on the acoustic properties of DF systems, which consist of more than two glass panes, in contrast to the usually referenced double systems, which only have two (glass) panes. The goals for this research were set: a clear and detailed picture on the acoustic behaviour of DF and the creation of an acoustic calculation model to predict the facade insulation of DF with sufficient accuracy and with limited computation time, which is crucial <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> stage of a building project. This model is a semi-empiric hybrid model (SEHM) which consists of existing adapted and new models based on statistical energy analysis (SEA) and semi-empiric models. The SEHM has been validated by comparison with a large amount of experimental results and reveals to be very encouraging, showing high accuracy over the investigated frequency bands and minimal computation time.

60|$|I was {{too young}} myself to take much part {{in the war of}} the revolution, though {{accident}} made me an eye-witness of some of its most important events, and that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> age of fifteen. At twelve--the American intellect ever was and continues to be singularly precocious--I was sent to Nassau Hall, Princeton, to be educated, and I remained there until I finally got a degree, though it was not without several long and rude interruptions of my studies. Although so early sent to college, I did not actually graduate until I was nineteen, the troubled times requiring nearly twice as long a servitude to make a Bachelor of Arts of me as would have been necessary in the more halcyon days of peace. Thus I made a fragment of a campaign when only a sophomore, and another the first year I was junior. I say the first year, because I was obliged to pass two years in each of the two higher classes of the institution, in order {{to make up for lost}} time. A youth cannot very well be campaigning and studying Euclid in the academic bowers, at the same moment. Then I was so young, that a year, more or less, was of no great moment.|$|E
