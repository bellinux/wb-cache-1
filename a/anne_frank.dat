5|$|Over the years, several {{films about}} <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> appeared. Her life and {{writings}} have inspired {{a diverse group}} of artists and social commentators to make reference to her in literature, popular music, television, and other media. These include The <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> Ballet by Adam Darius, first performed in 1959, and the choral work Annelies, first performed in 2005. The only known footage of the real <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> comes from a 1941 silent film recorded for her newlywed next-door neighbour. She is seen leaning out of a second-floor window in an attempt to better view the bride and groom. The couple, who survived the war, gave the film to the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> House.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, at a {{performance}} of The Diary of <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> in Vienna, Simon Wiesenthal was challenged {{by a group of}} protesters who asserted that <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> had never existed, and who challenged Wiesenthal to prove her existence by finding the man who had arrested her. Wiesenthal indeed began searching for Karl Silberbauer and found him in 1963. When interviewed, Silberbauer admitted his role, and identified <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> from a photograph as one of the people arrested. Silberbauer provided a full account of events, even recalling emptying a briefcase full of papers onto the floor. His statement corroborated the version of events that had previously been presented by witnesses such as Otto Frank.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1944, {{the group}} was {{deported}} on {{what would be the}} last transport from Westerbork to the Auschwitz concentration camp and arrived after a three-day journey. On the same train was Bloeme Evers-Emden, an Amsterdam native who had befriended Margot and Anne in the Jewish Lyceum in 1941. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot, and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, and was interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the television documentary The Last Seven Months of <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> (1988) by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer and the BBC documentary <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> Remembered (1995).|$|E

5|$|Bloeme was {{deported}} to Auschwitz {{on the last}} train leaving Westerbork on 3 September 1944. On the same train were the Frank family who had been discovered in hiding on 4 August. Bloeme saw Anne, Margot and their mother regularly in Auschwitz, although {{she was part of}} a separate group of eight women who stayed together, encouraging and helping one another. In October 1944, Bloeme and her group were selected for transfer to the Liebau labor camp in Upper Silesia. For the filming of the 1995 BBC documentary <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> Remembered, Bloeme recalled that Anne, Margot, and their mother, Edith, also planned to join the transport, but Anne was prohibited from joining because she had developed scabies. Her mother and sister opted to stay with her, and Bloeme went on without them. Bloeme was also interviewed for her remembrances of the Frank women in Auschwitz in the 1988 television documentary The Last Seven Months of <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> by Dutch filmmaker Willy Lindwer.|$|E

5|$|Cornelis Suijk—a former {{director}} of the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> Foundation and president of the U.S. Center for Holocaust Education Foundation—announced in 1999 {{that he was in the}} possession of five pages that had been removed by Otto Frank from the diary prior to publication; Suijk claimed that Otto Frank gave these pages to him shortly before his death in 1980. The missing diary entries contain critical remarks by <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> about her parents' strained marriage and discuss Frank's lack of affection for her mother. Some controversy ensued when Suijk claimed publishing rights over the five pages; he intended to sell them to raise money for his foundation. The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the formal owner of the manuscript, demanded the pages be handed over. In 2000 the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science agreed to donate US$300,000 to Suijk's foundation, and the pages were returned in 2001. Since then, they have been included in new editions of the diary.|$|E
5|$|Filming in Pittsburgh {{included}} the interior scenes at the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> House, which was recreated on a soundstage at Pittsburgh Studios located in Churchill Borough, Pennsylvania {{in the east}} suburbs of Pittsburgh.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the film, Spielberg founded the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit {{organization}} with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories.

I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> House {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a plausible {{explanation for the}} raid {{that led to the}} arrest of the Franks.

5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of the Holocaust and more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E

Adjoining the church is a sensory herb garden and The Normandy Garden of Peace, which was opened on 5 November 1995, with five Silver Birch trees, managed by Bristol's D-Day veterans, {{in memory of the}} five D-Day beaches. There are also memorials for trees for <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{published}} in Germany and France in 1950, and after being rejected by several publishers, {{was first published}} in the United Kingdom in 1952. The first American edition, published in 1952 under the title , was positively reviewed. The book was successful in France, Germany, and the United States, but in the United Kingdom it failed to attract an audience and by 1953 was out of print. Its most noteworthy success was in Japan, where it received critical acclaim and sold more than 100,000 copies in its first edition. In Japan, <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> quickly was identified as an important cultural figure who represented the destruction of youth during the war.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank,</b> who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank</b> House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's {{employers}} terminated {{his services}} in 1960, {{as there were}} too few refugees left {{in the city to}} justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of several hundred dollars per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested {{as a result of his}} activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in the newspaper that Karl Silberbauer, the man who had arrested famed diarist <b>Anne</b> <b>Frank,</b> had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended from the force, but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family.|$|E
