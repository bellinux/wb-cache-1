[...] Badu's lyrics, delivered in an incantation style, make reference to various names of God, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jah, and Rastafari, while asserting hip hop to be [...] "bigger than" [...] social institutions such as religion and government.

God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script.
