5|$|Around {{the time}} the highway was completed, the federal {{government}} began to promote suburbanization by moving several federal agencies out of the capital {{in order to protect}} them against nuclear <b>attack.</b> <b>As</b> a result, suburban neighborhoods began to appear in Laurel, Severn, Bowie, and Greenbelt. In addition, the road became a prime commuting route into both Washington and Baltimore, leading to suburban growth that would eventually cause the two distinct cities to merge into one large metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary <b>attack.</b> <b>As</b> a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E

5|$|Muirhead-Gould {{gave the}} general alarm, along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the alarm was {{repeated}} at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against <b>attack,</b> <b>as</b> an enemy submarine {{might be in}} the harbour. At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 2013, two rockets hit a Hezbollah area of Beirut {{injuring}} {{five people}} whilst another two rockets caused property {{damage to buildings}} in the al-Hermel district of Beirut. Syrian rebels have been blamed for the <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> they had promised to attack Hezbollah targets in Lebanon in retaliation for their helping the Syrian army particularly in the border town of Al-Qusayr. Syrian rebels have also shelled al-Hermel previously.|$|E
5|$|On 6October 1971, American soldier Jacob Singer is {{with the}} 1st Air Cavalry Division, {{deployed}} in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War, when his close-knit unit comes under <b>attack.</b> <b>As</b> many of Jacob’s comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering catatonia, convulsions and seizures. A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut by an unseen assailant.|$|E
50|$|Some analysts see the <b>attacks</b> <b>as</b> a {{shift away}} from {{reliance}} on suicide bombing, which was previously Hamas's main method of <b>attacking</b> Israel, <b>as</b> an adoption of the rocket tactics used by Lebanese group Hezbollah.|$|R

5|$|Pericles and {{his friends}} were never immune from <b>attack,</b> <b>as</b> preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Just before the eruption of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles and two of his closest associates, Phidias and his companion, Aspasia, faced a series of personal and judicial attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain {{began in}} July 1940 with the Luftwaffe making attacks on British {{shipping}} in the English Channel and Britain's East Coast. In August RAF Fighter Command's bases came under <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> the Germans attempted to establish air superiority over southern England. The battles grew larger in scale, but 41 Squadron, {{based in the}} north, were well clear of the main combat zone and saw little action {{for the first four}} weeks of the German air offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian {{high command}} {{did not attempt}} to perform a spoiling <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> they lacked the {{necessary}} vehicles and pack animals. The barrage did not cause a significant number of casualties but severely affected the Bulgarian esprit de corps. On the night between 14 and 15 September, Franco-Serbian patrols reported that the artillery barrage had dealt sufficient damage to the barbed wire entanglements separating the trenches.|$|E

An extensive compensation program was quickly established by Congress in the aftermath to compensate the victims and families of victims of the 9/11 <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the shooting, Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik stated that the Taliban gunman who shot Yousafzai had been identified.

5|$|When the teamsheets were released, Wenger's {{selection}} showed Rosický and Giroud {{would start}} the match as substitutes and competitive debuts {{were given to}} Mathieu Debuchy, Calum Chambers and Alexis Sánchez. Arsenal employed a 4–1–4–1 formation to start the game, with a defensive midfielder (Mikel Arteta) sitting between a flat back four and a four-man midfield; Yaya Sanogo led the Arsenal <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> a lone centre-forward.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} passed on April 2, Melkonian's armor entered the intersection and encountered {{a line of}} Azeri tanks and infantry. A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed. Many of the Azeri forces were ill-prepared for the <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment. Despite having his force reduced down {{to a total of}} sixty-eight men, a force too weak to take the capital, he ordered them to continue forward.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish <b>attack,</b> <b>as</b> it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect the crops against Scottish attacks.|$|E

5|$|Eleven of {{the twelve}} USAF {{personnel}} lost {{on the day of}} the battle were listed first as missing in action (MIA), then later as KIA/body not recovered. Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border. In 2002 two of the former VPA soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.|$|E
5|$|From March to September 1937, Lützow, now an Oberleutnant (first lieutenant), claimed five victories, {{including}} the first ever recorded claim by a Messerschmitt Bf 109 pilot. Flying a Bf109B, he shot down an Polikarpov I-15, a Soviet built biplane fighter aircraft, on 6 April 1937. On 26 April 1937, air elements of the Condor Legion targeted and bombed Guernica, an attack which has been characterised as a war crime by Wette and Ueberschär, but Lützow {{did not participate in}} the <b>attack</b> <b>as</b> he was on home leave from 8–29 April 1937. After he returned, Lützow claimed three more I-15s shot down, one on 22 May, another on 28 May, and his last on 18 August 1937. His final aerial victory in Spain was over a Polikarpov I-16, a monoplane fighter aircraft, which he shot down on 22 August 1937.|$|E
5|$|Hadleigh Castle is {{a ruined}} {{fortification}} in the English county of Essex, overlooking the Thames Estuary from {{south of the}} town of Hadleigh. Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role. The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III, who turned it into a grander property, designed to defend against a potential French <b>attack,</b> <b>as</b> well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London. Built on a geologically unstable hill of London clay, the castle has often been subject to subsidence; this, combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century, has led to it now being ruined. The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
