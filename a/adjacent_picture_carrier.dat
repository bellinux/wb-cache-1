40|$|Algorithms {{developed}} to reduce number of radar polarimetric data processed to synthesize image of arbitrary combination of transmitting and receiving polarizations. Brings image-processing requirements within computing capabilities of typical users, without degrading images excessively. In scattering-matrix approach to reduction of image data, four <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture</b> elements combined into one by synthesizing new scattering matrix from scattering matrices of four elements. In phase-matrix approach, phase matrices generated from scattering matrices of four <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture</b> elements, and four phase matrices added to combine four picture elements into one...|$|R

50|$|For a {{continuous}} function {{on the real}} line, one branch is required between each pair of local extrema. For example, the inverse of a cubic function with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture).</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to carrying the static forces, the members serve additional functions of stabilizing each other, preventing buckling. In the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture,</b> the top chord is prevented from buckling {{by the presence}} of bracing and by the stiffness of the web members.|$|R
50|$|Grand Island's geology is an {{extension}} of the sandstone strata of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>Pictured</b> Rocks National Lakeshore. Island sandstone cliffs as tall as 300 ft in height plunge down into the lake. A 23 mi perimeter trail skirts much of the island's shoreline.|$|R
50|$|The bloated stomach, {{as seen in}} the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture,</b> {{represents}} a form of malnutrition called kwashiorkor which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake.

25|$|The bloated stomach, {{as seen in}} the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture,</b> {{represents}} a form of malnutrition called kwashiorkor which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake. Better medicine will prevent the pictured symptoms in which included is weight loss and muscle wasting from further taking form.|$|R

No actual use of the weapons was made although there were many trials using 'live' chemical weapons (such as shown in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first logo of the Mercury brand was its namesake, the Roman god Mercury. The {{side profile}} {{of his head}} (complete with {{signature}} bowl hat with wings) was used during the early years, seen in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture.</b> From 2003 to 2004, this logo {{was used for the}} wheel centers of the Mercury Marauder.|$|R

25|$|Titan's {{atmosphere}} supports an opaque {{cloud layer}} that obscures Titan's surface features at visible wavelengths. The haze {{that can be}} seen in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture</b> contributes to the moon's anti-greenhouse effect and lowers the temperature by reflecting sunlight away from the satellite. The thick atmosphere blocks most visible wavelength light from the Sun and other sources from reaching Titan's surface.|$|R
50|$|Besides having {{almost all}} the legends in Amharic, there are two {{features}} that help to immediately identify an Ethiopian birr. Early dated coins, those dated before EE1969, feature a crowned rampant lion holding a cross. This {{can be seen in}} the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture.</b> Later dated coins, those dated EE1969 or after, picture the head of a roaring lion, with a flowing mane.|$|R
50|$|The chairs {{still exist}} to this day. One of them (also {{known as the}} Hall Porter's Chair) stands in the {{entrance}} to 10 Downing Street; the other is owned by a private collector of furniture.

50|$|Originally, {{the term}} photomosaic {{referred}} to compound photographs created by stitching together {{a series of}} <b>adjacent</b> <b>pictures</b> of a scene. Space scientists have been assembling mosaics of this kind since at least {{as early as the}} Soviet Union space satellite missions to the moon in the late 1950s. The name photomosaic and an implementation concept were trademarked by Robert Silvers' Runaway Technology, Inc.|$|R
5000|$|A {{clue that}} {{indicated}} that the Ice Borer story was a hoax {{can be found in}} the name of the biologist who discovered the animal, [...] "Aprile Pazzo" [...] ("April Fool" [...] in Italian). Secondly, for those familiar with the creature, the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture</b> is clearly a manipulated image of a naked mole-rat, a curious burrowing rodent found in East Africa.|$|R

The haze {{that can be}} seen in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture</b> contributes to the moon's anti-greenhouse effect and lowers the temperature by reflecting sunlight away from the satellite.

50|$|Caves {{found in}} this reserve include the Victoria Arch, {{one of the most}} popular due to its {{proximity}} to the camping grounds, and Fig Tree Cave, shown in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>picture.</b> Other caves include Junction, Wollondilly, Mulwaree and Kooringa caves. Several NSW caving groups run regular trips to Wombeyan Caves, these are official caving groups that obtain permits for various cave related expeditions.|$|R
