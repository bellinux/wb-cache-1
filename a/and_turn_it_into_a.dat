5|$|Sampson {{also made}} enemies when he backed Samuel Insull's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to {{generate}} hydroelectric power. An {{ally of the}} traditional southern power groups—the utility companies and textbook manufacturers—Sampson cited the jobs {{to be gained from}} the plan. The plan was opposed conservationists in the state and by most of the state's newspapers. An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville-born millionaire and Delaware senator T. Coleman du Pont, who offered to purchase the falls for $230,000 <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> state park. The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of eminent domain over the falls, then voted to accept the du Pont's offer. Sampson vetoed the Assembly's action, but his veto was overridden.|$|E
5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Blast Corps for the Nintendo 64. The game sold {{one million}} copies, which was considered disappointing by Rare. At that time, Rare was split into several teams, working on different projects. A large-scaled platformer {{was set to}} be released afterwards but was delayed. As a result, Rare changed their schedule and released their smaller projects first. The first project was GoldenEye 007, a game based on the titular film. The project was led by Martin Hollis and development was conducted by an inexperienced team. Inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, Goldeneye 007 had originally been an on-rail shooter before the team decided to expand the gameplay <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> free-roaming first-person shooter. New elements, such as stealth, headshot mechanics and reloading, were introduced. A split-screen multiplayer {{was added to the}} game by the end of its development. GoldenEye 007 was the first console first-person shooter developed by Rare and it was released two years after the release of the film. The game received very high critical praise and received numerous awards. It is often credited for having revolutionised the genre of first-person shooting video games. Goldeneye 007 remained as one of the best-selling games for two years, and sold more than eight million units worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The flood had {{a massive}} effect on Fairbanks. Four people were killed, {{and the damage}} ran into the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars. It helped push the city's remaining farm, Creamer's Dairy, into bankruptcy, and it forced the closure of St. Joseph's Hospital. Fairbanks residents responded to the problems with aplomb. The annual Tanana Valley State Fair was postponed but not canceled. Seven thousand dollars were raised to buy Creamer's Dairy <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bird sanctuary. KTVF, one of the few town businesses to have flood insurance, rebuilt its studio and became the first Fairbanks TV station to broadcast in color, four months after the flood. When two bond measures to build a government-run hospital were turned down by Fairbanks voters, residents raised $2.6 million from private contributions and $6 million from the state and federal government to build Fairbanks Memorial Hospital.|$|E

5|$|The Avon then {{flows through}} Bathford, {{where it is}} joined by the Bybrook River, and Bathampton where it passes under the Bathampton Toll Bridge. It is joined by the Lam Brook at Lambridge in Bath and then passes under Cleveland and Pulteney Bridges and over the weir. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine, owner of the Coalbrookdale Ironworks, with Henry Goodridge as the architect, {{on the site of}} a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further {{development}} of Georgian Bath to take place {{on the south side of}} the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using Bath Stone and a cast iron arched span. Pulteney Bridge was completed in 1773 and is designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The bridge was designed by Robert Adam, whose working drawings are preserved in the Sir John Soane's Museum, and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It is named after Frances Pulteney, heiress in 1767 of the Bathwick estate across the river from Bath. Pulteney approached the brothers Robert and James Adam with his new town in mind, but Robert Adam then became involved in the design of the bridge. In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops. Adam had visited both Florence and Venice, where he would have seen the Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte di Rialto. But Adam's design more closely followed Andrea Palladio's rejected design for the Rialto. Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops marred the elegance of the façades. Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. It was rebuilt by John Pinch the elder, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam's design. 19th century shopkeepers altered windows, or cantilevered out over the river as the fancy took them. The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match. In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument, with plans being made for the restoration of the original façade. The restoration was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951, with further work being carried out in 1975. Bath and North East Somerset council have discussed plans to ban vehicles from the bridge <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pedestrianised zone, however it remains open to buses and taxis.|$|E

25|$|In March 1978, Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland {{introduced}} legislation in Congress to designate {{the entire area}} bounded by Rock Creek Park, Key Bridge, the Potomac River and the C Canal a national park.

The legislation died, but in early 1979 Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon {{introduced legislation}} requiring the NPS to buy just the Chessie System and Inland Steel land in the area <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> national park. This legislation began to move forward in the Senate, which provided new urgency to settle the park issue on the waterfront.|$|E
25|$|Business slumped with General Motors {{after the}} second {{sponsorship}} deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new ride that focused only on cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a test car against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.|$|E

During Operation Hirondelle, the French Union paratroopers captured and destroyed tons of Soviet supplies in the Ky Lua area. According to General Giap, the Viet Minh used 400 GAZ-51 soviet-built trucks {{at the battle of}} Dien Bien Phu. Because the trucks were using highly effective camouflage, the French Union reconnaissance planes were not able to notice them. On May 6, 1954, during the siege, Katyusha were successfully used against the outpost. Together with China, the Soviet Union sent 2,000 military advisors to train the Viet Minh <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fully organized army.|$|E
25|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Junction 11, near Reading, was {{extensively}} remodelled {{with a new}} four-lane motorway junction, two {{new road}} bridges and other works. The £65m scheme included work on the Mereoak roundabout {{and part of the}} A33 Swallowfield Bypass near Shinfield, and also the conversion of the two existing bridges, one of which is available only to pedestrians and cyclists and the other to buses. It also involved the movement of the local Highways Agency and Fire Service offices, and the construction of a long footbridge network, a new bus-lane and a new gyratory. Sound barriers for nearby residential areas were also installed. In April 2008, the decision to preserve a rare Vickers machine gun pillbox <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bat roost was announced by the developers.|$|E
25|$|When the Lumia 920 was {{announced}} in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly. Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation: the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft. The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, {{as well as for}} Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> devices and services company.

25|$|Leonard Goldenson, the {{president}} of UPT (which sought to diversify itself at the time), approached Noble in 1951 on a proposal for UPT to purchase ABC. Noble received other offers, including one from CBS founder William S. Paley; however, a merger with CBS would have forced that network to sell its New York City and Los Angeles stations at the very least. Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> subsidiary {{of the company that}} would retain autonomy in its management. On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors. However, the transaction had to be approved by the FCC {{because of the presence of}} television networks and the recent separation between Paramount and UPT. Insofar as Paramount Pictures was already a shareholder in the DuMont Television Network, the FCC conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether Paramount was truly separated from United Paramount Theatres, and whether it was violating antitrust laws.|$|E
25|$|Kirksville’s other railroad, the Wabash Railroad, {{became the}} Norfolk and Western Railway in October, 1964. This north-south line {{later became the}} Norfolk Southern Railway in 1982 after N merged with Southern Railway. In April 1992, the last {{official}} NS train ran the line between Albia, IA and Moberly, MO as the railroad announced it would abandon the line due to a loss in profit. During the summer of 1993, the railroad reopened to train traffic as the floods of the midwest affected lines around the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Trains continued to run the line until 1995. After failed attempts from buyers wanting to purchase the line <b>and</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> shortline railroad, work began on tearing down the railroad from Moberly, MO northward toward La Plata, MO where it has a connection with the BNSF Railway and from Moulton, IA southward toward La Plata, MO. The portion of the line from Moulton, IA northward towards Albia was purchased by the Appanoose County Community Railroad. In late September 1997, the tracks through Kirksville were finally torn down leaving the city without a rail line. The project {{to tear down the}} abandoned line was completed by the end of 1997.|$|E
