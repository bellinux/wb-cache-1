50|$|<b>As</b> <b>high-powered</b> {{graphics}} hardware draws considerable {{power and}} generates significant heat, {{many of the}} 3D effects developed between 2000 and 2010 are not practical on this class of device.

50|$|The lack of <b>a</b> single <b>high-powered</b> {{frequency}} for {{the east}} of the county was because of international frequency clearance problems due to the proximity to France across the English Channel. Instead three low-powered transmitters were installed in Ashford, Folkestone/Dover and Thanet. This problem did not affect BBC national and local radio, which use <b>a</b> single <b>high-powered</b> site at Swingate, near Dover.|$|R
5|$|Mardas {{was jealous}} about the control the Maharishi had over Lennon, and {{during one of}} their {{frequent}} walks through the woods he asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Lennon replied that the Beatles (or Lennon and Harrison) were considering donating {{a large part of}} their income to the Maharishi's bank accounts in Switzerland. When Mardas questioned the Maharishi about this, he offered money to Mardas to build <b>a</b> <b>high-powered</b> radio station, so he could broadcast Maharishi's teachings to the whole of India.|$|E
5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is <b>a</b> <b>high-powered</b> {{digital radio}} signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. More {{than half a million}} people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, <b>a</b> <b>high-powered</b> device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E

5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are {{low-power}} and high-power devices. Low-power devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices must act as low-power devices when starting out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. <b>A</b> <b>high-powered</b> device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration.

5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced <b>a</b> <b>high-powered</b> gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings have been gone through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with <b>a</b> <b>high-powered</b> electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific.|$|E

40|$|Service {{discovery}} protocols for mobile ad hoc networks at- tempt {{to overcome}} the inability to locate resources presented by networks in which prior knowledge of node identity and capability is not available. Existing approaches continue to rely on underlying address-based rout- ing protocols in order to communicate with discovered services. These two-tier approaches generate routing overheads which negatively impact on performance and network scalability. <b>As</b> <b>high-powered</b> mobile computing devices with wireless connectivity be- come increasingly ubiquitous, the need for routing protocols which can operate at increased network densities becomes more acute. Cross-layer approaches to service discovery in MANETs have attempted to optimize the discovery process through direct integration with underlying rout- ing protocols, however additional steps are necessary to improve service discovery performance, network scalability and application throughput. This paper describes the Service Discovery and Routing Protocol (SDRP), a novel service-oriented routing protocol for MANETs. This protocol es- chews the use of network-wide unique addresses or underlying address- based routing protocols and focuses instead on routing only to and from nodes which provide services. A comparison with existing approaches demonstrates that this approach improves discovery success rates and application throughput at higher node densities...|$|R
