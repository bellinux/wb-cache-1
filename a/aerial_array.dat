A distinctive diamond-shaped DF aerial was fitted on the cabin roof, replacing the loop antenna.

50|$|In 1935 the BBC {{started looking}} for {{transmitter}} sites to improve radio coverage in Devon, Dorset and Cornwall. After investigating 23 sites and carrying out extensive tests, two sites were selected: Start Point and Clevedon in Somerset. Start Point came on air on June 14, 1939 using an ST&C type C100 100 kW transmitter on 1050 kHz, and broadcast the West of England regional programme. A directional <b>aerial</b> <b>array</b> was used to avoid wasting power over the English Channel and to enhance the signal {{to the east and}} west. It consisted of two 137 m stayed lattice masts, one being a mast radiator and the other a parasitic reflector. Both masts had a break at 94.5 m to allow for the insertion of a loading coil.|$|E
50|$|The 189-acre {{site was}} {{acquired}} by the BBC in November 1939 and the station, known as Overseas Extension 3 (OSE3), was equipped with four Marconi type SWB 18, 100 kW short-wave transmitters. The transmitter halls, each containing a pair of these transmitters, were separated by heavy blast walls. A comprehensive aerial system was installed consisting of 29 arrays supported between 15 masts of heights varying between l00 ft and 325 ft. Full world coverage was given by this aerial system, although the transmissions were primarily intended for areas outside Europe. This {{was the first of}} the BBC's short-wave stations to be provided with 4-wire transmission lines, following tests made at Daventry (OSE1). A remotely controlled switching tower was used for connecting any transmitter to any <b>aerial</b> <b>array</b> (antenna).|$|E

Additional rhombic aerials were erected to boost shortwave reception from the Middle East and North Africa, alongside those already used for signals from Europe and the Soviet Union, the latter having been the station's priority target during the Cold War. One of the two curtain aerials (which had been used for the relaying by the BBC of the Voice of America) was taken down. The remaining curtain aerial was taken down in more recent years.|$|R

40|$|WiMAX可允許採用智慧型天線（Smart Antenna）的技術，而所謂的智慧型天線的「智慧」便是來自於天線內含一組數位訊號處理器（Digital Signal Processor；DSP）。以陣列天線為例，便是將數個天線陣列排列，同時接收數個不同方向的訊號，並經由DSP計算每個訊號的角度，進而找出在某個角度時最遠的通訊距離，此技術也提高了WiMAX的涵蓋率。而智慧型天線由於有數個天線接收及發送訊號，也附帶提高了非使用者攫取非法訊號的難度，進而提高了傳輸的安全性。以OFDM技術為基礎的WiMAX，其實是行動寬頻數據服務中最好的技術．尤其是當WiMAX再加入多輸入多輸出（MIMO）智慧型天線技術之後，更能讓WiMAX技術發揮到極致。同時，智慧型天線可以讓WiMAX系統克服建築物穿透 10 dB以上的損失，使得行動裝置不再受到建築物障礙的局限。WiMAX can {{utilize the}} smart antenna technology, which uses the digital signal {{processor}} (DSP) to process signals received from the antenna arrays. The smart antennas employ several <b>aerial</b> <b>arrays,</b> receiving the signals from several different directions at the same time. The smart antennas also calculate the angle of each signal which transmitted through the DSP, and then find out the farthest communication distance in a certain angle. This technology extends the coverage of WiMAX system. Smart antenna technology uses antenna arrays to transmit and receive signals, preventing the unauthorized users to acquire the information. The WiMAX system which based on the OFDM technology is the best technology for wideband transmission. If MIMO smart antennas are equipped in the WiMAX system, WiMAX system could achieve much better performance.

40|$|Abstract—Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{are used}} in various applications such as civil and military surveillance, law enforcement, and support in natural disasters {{as well as in}} hazardous environments. Approaching and landing are necessary steps for all UAVs, indicating that radio altimeters are needed. In this paper, a radio altimeter based on an antenna array is proposed. Our solution allows some improvements over the traditional radio altimeter such as more precise altitude estimation, ground imaging without the need of side looking radar, mapping the obstacles positions and detecting the ground inclination and topology. Another important contribution of this paper is a review of traditional radio altimeters along with a performance comparison between the level-crossing detection and the digital signal processing frequency detection- which is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm.

40|$|Pose estimation, which {{determines the}} {{position}} and {{the attitude of the}} camera, is a prerequisite for a variety of photogrammetric tasks such as image matching, surface reconstruction, ortho-photo generation, and object recognition. As digital imagery is becoming more popular in photogrammetric applications, features other than points are increasingly employed in pose estimation. For frame imagery, prior research has incorporated geometric constraints into the bundle adjustment to take advantage of high-level features, such as straight lines. This study introduces high-level feature constraints into the pose estimation problem for aerial line scanners. Traditionally, it has been assumed that robust pose estimation for a dynamic (non-frame) sensor cannot be obtained without direct measurements using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation system (INS). This study attempts to challenge, in part, this argument by showing that the unknown orientation parameters for all scan lines, within a scene captured by line scanner, can be estimated by including linear features in an indirect orientation procedure that is less dependent on GPS/INS data. This indirect orientation is achieved by incorporating straight-line constraints in the bundle adjustment for <b>aerial</b> linear <b>array</b> scanners. A scene captured by an aerial line scanner is composed of sequence of scan lines, each of which may be slightly shifted against each other due to changes in the system’s trajectory. As a result, straight lines in object space do not appear as straight lines in image space. The straight-line constraint is proposed in this study to cope with this phenomenon. This constraint makes use of straightlin...|$|R

More significantly, the cell could be amorphized by a reset pulse of 1. 8 V height and 100 ns width, where the reset current was 100 mu A. Such a low reset current, presumably caused by nanoscale small cell dimension, is greatly beneficial for low power consumption device operation.

40|$|In this paper, the {{effective}} use of multiple quadrotor drones as an <b>aerial</b> antenna <b>array</b> that provides wireless service to ground users is investigated. In particular, under the goal of minimizing the airborne service time needed for communicating with ground users, a novel framework for deploying and operating a drone-based antenna array system whose elements are single-antenna drones is proposed. In the considered model, the service time is minimized by jointly optimizing the wireless transmission {{time as well as}} the control time that is needed for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the transmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the drone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques, the drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive, perturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the drones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time for the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones, the drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so as to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor drones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the destinations of the drones and external forces (e. g., wind and gravity). In particular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well as the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground users compared to a multi-drone scenario in which the same number of drones are deployed separately to serve ground users. The results also show that, in comparison with the multi-drones case, the network's spectral efficiency can be significantly improved...|$|R

Observations of the 557. 7 nm airglow intensity emitted by atomic oxygen (OI) at heights near 97 km and the 730. 0 nm airglow intensity emitted by hydroxyl (OH) near 87 km have been made simultaneously with MF spaced antenna observations of wind velocities in the 80 – 100 km height region. The 3 FP measures the intensity of the 557. 7 nm airglow in three fields separated by about 13 km at heights near 97 km, and then the intensity of the 730 nm airglow in three fields separated by about 12 km at heights near 87 km, on a 60 s cycle. These data have been analyzed to yield gravity wave observed phase speeds and horizontal wavelengths.
