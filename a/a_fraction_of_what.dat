At the time of Barr's death, both wrestlers were in negotiations to work for ECW part-time, which became full-time in 1995. Guerrero would later end up working full-time for World Championship Wrestling, which had produced When Worlds Collide. After Barr's death, AAA retired the AAA World Tag Team Championship in Barr's honor. With Barr dying and Guerrero leaving, Los Gringos Locos was abandoned as well.|$|E

The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side. Bent on becoming the new messiah for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the United Nations in New York and issues an ultimatum: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive - or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.|$|E

25|$|At {{the onset}} of the First World War, the cost of gold was very low and {{therefore}} the pound sterling had high value. But during the First World War, the value of the pound fell alarmingly due to rising war expenses. At the conclusion of the war, the value of the pound was only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it used to be prior to the commencement of the war. It remained low until 1925, when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, restored it to pre-War levels. As a result, the price of gold fell rapidly. While the rest of Europe purchased large quantities of gold from the United Kingdom, there was little increase in her gold reserves. This dealt a blow to an already deteriorating British economy. The United Kingdom began to look to its possessions as India to compensate for the gold that was sold.|$|E

At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E
25|$|On his return, de Hory {{discovered}} that his paintings were fetching high prices at several art galleries, and was incensed that the galleries had only paid him <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{they thought the}} paintings were worth. Further compounding de Hory's plight was that the manner of his forgeries had become recognizable, and he was now {{a person of interest}} to the FBI. This unwanted attention may have prompted de Hory to temporarily abandon his fakery and resume creating his own artwork once more. This led him to an ascetic existence in a low-rent apartment near Pershing Square in Los Angeles. Here, he had limited success, mostly selling paintings of pink poodles to interior decorators. However, his self-imposed exile was not to his liking. He decided to return to the East Coast and try his luck once more at his illicit craft, for which he always found an eager buyer—eventually. In Washington DC, de Hory began an ill-fated association with a picture dealer that ended in disaster. In 1959, suffering from depression, he attempted suicide by overdose of sleeping pills. A friend rescued him and called an ambulance. His stomach was pumped, and after a stay in the hospital, de Hory convalesced in New York City, helped by an enterprising young man, Fernand Legros.|$|E

Markham accused Bruce of [...] "mischievous rivalry", and of attempting to [...] "cripple the National Expedition... {{in order to get}} up a scheme for yourself".

40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{two-stage}} algorithm for computing the PageRank vector [16]. The algorithm exploits the following observation: the homogeneous discrete-time Markov chain associated with PageRank is lumpable, with the lumpable subset of nodes being the dangling nodes [13]. Time to convergence is only <b>a</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> {{required for the}} standard algorithm employed by Google [16]. On data of 451, 237 webpages, convergence was achieved in 20 % of the time. Our algorithm also replaces a common practice which is in general incorrect. Namely, the practice of ignoring the dangling nodes until the last stages of computation [16] does not necessarily accelerate convergence. In comparison, our algorithm is provable, generally applicable, and achieves the desired speedup. The paper ends {{with a discussion of}} possible extensions that generalize the divide-and-conquer theme. We describe two variations that incorporate a multi-stage algorithm. In the first variation, the ordinary PageRank vector is computed. In the second variation, the algorithm computes a generalized version of PageRank where webpages are divided into several classes, each incorporating a different personalization vector. The latter represents a major modeling extension and introduces greater flexibility and a potentially more refined model for web traffic...|$|R

Shortage and disease afflicted the massively overpopulated valley of Copán when its last known king, UkitTook', came to the throne on 6February 822. He commissioned AltarL in the style of AltarQ but the monument was never finished — one face shows the enthronement of the king and a second face was started but two others were completely blank. The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite.

And when long-term fiscal benefits are taken into consideration, it is clear that expenditures for universally available ECE services can more than pay for themselves (Belfield, 2005; Karoly et al., 2005; Morrissey & Warner, 2007). In addition, costs can be phased in, so that the system incrementally expands to include an increasing number of children and programs.|$|R
