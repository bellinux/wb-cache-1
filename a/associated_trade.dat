500|$|Spain's socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party ( [...] , PSOE) and its <b>associated</b> <b>trade</b> union, the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), gained support. The UGT {{grew from}} 8,000 members in 1908 to 200,000 in 1920. Branch offices (Casas del pueblo) of the unions were {{established}} in major cities. The UGT was constantly fearful of losing ground to the anarchists. It was respected for its discipline during strikes. However, it was centrist and anti-Catalan, with only 10,000 members in Barcelona as late as 1936. The PSOE and the UGT {{were based on a}} simple form of Marxism, one that assumed an inevitable revolution, and were isolationist in character. When the UGT moved their headquarters from Barcelona to Madrid in 1899, many industrial workers in Catalonia were no longer able to access it. Some elements of the PSOE recognised the need for cooperation with republican parties.|$|E
