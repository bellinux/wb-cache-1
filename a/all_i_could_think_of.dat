[...] "Temple's story brought me hope and (her mother)'s story gave me direction and purpose," [...] Gerson Saines said in a later interview. [...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, but <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here. This woman's my hero.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{determined}} to do summat in honour o't", said the dairyman. [...] "And as you wouldn't hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi' fiddles and bass-viols complete, as we should ha' done in old times, this was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> o' as a noiseless thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{to do was}} {{to go out and get}} in the buggy. The horse turned {{round and}} took me back to the hotel. I hitched him and went in to see Andy. In his room I told him about this farmer, word for word; and I sat picking at the table cover like one bereft of sagaciousness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your wife is fine," [...] {{the wall}} speaker above him said tonelessly. [...] "It was a fraud. I {{am sorry to}} trick you that way, Philip, but it was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of.</b> Another day {{and you would have}} been back on Terra. I don't want to remain in this area any longer than necessary. They have been so certain of finding me out in deep space that I have been able to stay here without too much danger. But even the purloined letter was found eventually." ...|$|E
60|$|It sounded footling even to myself, but I {{had been}} reading a novel of the {{realistic}} school that had been greatly praised for its actuality. There is a demand in some quarters for this class of observation. I likewise made a note that the pigeon and the corncrake appear {{to be among the}} earliest of Nature's children to welcome the coming day; and added that the screech-owl may be heard, perhaps at its best, by anyone caring to rise for the purpose, some quarter of an hour before the dawn. That was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> just then. As regards emotions, I did not seem to have any.|$|E
5000|$|The Website Black Horror Movies {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars, stating: [...] "By the end, the action is so ridiculous, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was the Simpsons episode about Snake Whacking Day.

60|$|I {{have now}} said <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> {{convenient}} with relation to your conduct in the pulpit: your behaviour in life[13] is another scene, upon which I shall readily offer you my thoughts, if {{you appear to}} desire them from me by your approbation of what I have here written; if not, I have already troubled you too much.|$|R
60|$|This went on {{for five}} glorious years, the only {{years of my life}} I'd ever lived, and then came, as I thought, the end of everything. John Henry took typhoid and died. At first that was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of; and when I got so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of other things, there was, as I have said, nothing for me to do but go back east.|$|R
6000|$|... “If it {{was anxious}} to go,” said Adela Pingsford rather angrily, “I should not have come here to chat with you about it. I’m {{practically}} all alone; the housemaid is having her afternoon out and the cook is lying down with an attack of neuralgia. Anything that I may have learned at school or in after life about how to remove a large ox from a small garden seems to have escaped from my memory now. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was {{that you were a}} near neighbour and a cattle painter, presumably more or less familiar with the subjects that you painted, and that you might be of some slight assistance. Possibly I was mistaken.” ...|$|E
60|$|In my town house, in Oakland, I {{finished}} {{the stock of}} liquor and wilfully refused to purchase more. It was no use, because, unfortunately, there remained {{in the bottom of}} the liquor cabinet a case of beer. In vain I tried to write. Now beer is a poor substitute for strong waters: besides, I didn't like beer, yet <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was that beer so singularly accessible {{in the bottom of the}} cabinet. Not until I had drunk a pint of it did the words begin to reel off, and the thousand were reeled off to the tune of numerous pints. The worst of it was that the beer caused me severe heart-burn; but despite the discomfort I soon finished off the case.|$|E
6000|$|... "('Of {{course you}} couldn't,' said Miss Amanda. 'You were a fine little manager; but when I {{looked out of}} my window that {{afternoon}} and saw a boy carrying a trunk to the barn I was very likely to suspect something; and when I {{went down to the}} barn myself and found Peter getting the buggy ready to go away early the next morning, I suspected a great deal more. I {{did not know what to}} do, for I did not want to make a scandal by letting Peter know anything was out of the way, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was to have a slow horse put in the buggy instead of a fast one. I thought that might help, anyway.') ...|$|E
50|$|I {{was feeling}} like death when I {{should have been}} {{on top of the}} world. The band picked up awards for Best British Band and Album and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was how much I wanted to be in bed. It was two days later that my doctor phoned to say she was worried I might be about to slip into a coma.|$|R
500|$|He told Rose: [...] "And look, I'm on bail for a murder. I know I'm stupid, but I'm {{not that}} stupid. There's helicopters, police photographers everywhere. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> about was that I didn't {{want to lose}} my bail."

2500|$|The bell {{located in}} front of the camper dining hall is used by the Rangers before lunch and dinner.

6000|$|... "That's just it!" [...] exclaimed Eleanor. [...] "I like him. I think he's sincere. And {{that first}} Sunday he came, when I saw him {{get up in}} the pulpit and wave that long arm of his, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was a modern Savonarola. He looks one. And then, when he began to preach, it was maddening. I felt all the time that he could say {{something}} helpful, if he only would. But he didn't. It was all about the sufficiency of grace,--whatever that may be. He didn't explain it. He didn't give me one notion as to how to cope a little better with the frightful complexities of the modern lives we live, or how to stop quarrelling with Phil when he stays at the office and is late for dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a fool}} to come, but I couldn't see it then. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was to {{get away}} {{to a place where}} {{something}} was happening. I wanted to get into Ferguson's--everybody in Madison knew about Ferguson's, what a grand store it was,--but I couldn't. And after a while I got a place at the embroidery counter at Pratt's. That's a department store, too, you know. It looked fine, but it wasn't long before I fell wise to a few things." [...] (She relapsed into slang occasionally.) [...] "Have you ever tried to stand on your feet for nine hours, where you couldn't sit down for a minute? Say, when Florry Kinsley and me--she was the girl I roomed with--would get home at night, often we'd just lie down and laugh and cry, we were so tired, and our feet hurt so. We were too used up sometimes to get up and cook supper on the little stove we had. And sitting around a back bedroom all evening was worse than Madison. We'd go out, tired as we were, and walk the streets." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{then try}} the next word in my {{specimen}} page of Curtis; {{but there is}} no 'Phalangium' at all in Loudon's index. And now I have neither time nor mind for more search, but will give, in due place, such account as I can {9} of my own dwarf branched lily, which I shall call St. Bruno's, as well as this Liliastrum--no offence to the saint, I hope. For it grows very gloriously on the limestones of Savoy, presumably, therefore, at the Grande Chartreuse; though I did not notice it there, and made a very unmonkish use of it when I gathered it last:--There was a pretty young English lady at the table-d'hôte, in the Hotel du Mont Blanc at St. Martin's,[3] and I wanted to get speech of her, and didn't know how. So <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was to go half-way up the Aiguille de Varens, to gather St. Bruno's lilies; and I made a great cluster of them, and put wild roses all around them as I came down. I never saw anything so lovely; and I thought to present this to her before dinner,--but when I got down, she had gone away to Chamouni. My Fors always treated me like that, in affairs of the heart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Peggotty?' 'I have tried, my dear, <b>all</b> ways <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of--all {{the ways}} there are, {{and all the}} ways there ain't, in short--to get a {{suitable}} service here, in Blunderstone; but there's no such a thing, my love.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Green Man is a persona {{assumed by}} Charlie wearing a green spandex suit in several episodes. The persona has spawned imitators, most notably at {{sporting}} events. Rob McElhenney adapted the idea {{after watching the}} Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys at Lincoln Financial Field. Without warning, {{in the parking lot}} after the game, a friend of McElhenney's stripped off his clothes and donned a full-body green spandex suit. McElhenney said: [...] "Everyone started chanting, 'Green Man! Green Man!' It went on for several hours, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> was, 'My God, {{there has to be a}} way I can take advantage of this on the show.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, {{after the}} release of Sun, Marshall began having trouble {{breathing}} and was hospitalized multiple times, though doctors were unable to diagnose her. [...] "I thought I was dying," [...] she recounted. [...] "They told me they were going to put me in a coma to save my lungs. My friend came to visit and told me I'd made the Billboard Top 10 and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> was: 'I don't want to die.'" [...] Marshall was subsequently diagnosed with hereditary angioedema, an immune disorder that causes sporadic swelling of the face and throat. In September 2012, she stated she had been hospitalized due to the condition over eight times, which led her to cancel her European tour.|$|R
6000|$|I {{started the}} next morning to call upon St. Leonard. Near to the house I {{encountered}} young Hopkins on a horse. He was waving a pitchfork over his head and reciting [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade." [...] The horse looked amused. He told me I should find [...] "the gov'nor" [...] up by the stables. St. Leonard is not an [...] "old man." [...] Dick must have seen him in a bad light. I should describe him as about the prime of life, a little older than myself, but nothing to speak of. Dick was right, however, in saying he was not like a farmer. To begin with, [...] "Hubert St. Leonard" [...] does not sound like a farmer. One can imagine a man with a name like that writing a book about farming, having theories on this subject. But in the ordinary course of nature things would not grow for him. He does not look like a farmer. One cannot say precisely what it is, but there is that about a farmer that tells you he is a farmer. The farmer has a way of leaning over a gate. There are not many ways of leaning over a gate. I have tried <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> but it was never quite the right way. It has to be in the blood. A farmer has a way of standing on one leg and looking at a thing that isn't there. It sounds simple, but there is knack in it. The farmer is not surprised it is not there. He never expected it to be there. It {{is one of those things}} that ought to be, and is not. The farmer's life is full of such. Suffering reduced to a science is what the farmer stands for. All his life he is the good man struggling against adversity. Nothing his way comes right. This does not seem to be his planet. Providence means well, but she does not understand farming. She is doing her best, he supposes; that she is a born muddler is not her fault. If Providence could only step down for a month or two and take a few lessons in practical farming, things might be better; but this being out of the question there is nothing more to be said. From conversation with farmers one conjures up a picture of Providence as a well-intentioned amateur, put into a position for which she is utterly unsuited.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few weeks}} later some one tapped me on the {{shoulder}} in Oxford Street. It was Scudamour. [...] "Heard from Henry?" [...] he asked. I said I had heard by the last mail. [...] "Anything particular in the letter?" [...] I felt it would not do to say that there was nothing particular in a letter which had come all the way from India, so I hinted that Henry was having trouble with his wife. By this I meant that her health was bad; but he took it up in another way, and I did not set him right. [...] "Ah, ah!" [...] he said, shaking his head sagaciously; [...] "I'm sorry to hear that. Poor Henry!" [...] "Poor old boy!" [...] was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> replying. [...] "How about the children?" [...] Scudamour asked. [...] "Oh, the children," [...] I said, with what I thought presence of mind, [...] "are coming to England." [...] "To stay with Alexander?" [...] he asked. My answer was that Alexander was expecting them by the middle of next month; and eventually Scudamour went away muttering, [...] "Poor Henry!" [...] In a month or so we met again. [...] "No word of Henry's getting leave of absence?" [...] asked Scudamour. I replied shortly that Henry had gone to live in Bombay, and would not be home for years. He saw that I was brusque, so what does he do but draw me aside for a quiet explanation. [...] "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "you are annoyed because I told Pettigrew that Henry's wife had run away from him. The fact is, I did it for your good. You see, I happened to make a remark to Pettigrew about your brother Henry, and he said that there was no such person. Of course I laughed at that, and pointed out not only that I had the pleasure of Henry's acquaintance, but that you and I had talked about the old fellow every time we met. 'Well,' Pettigrew said, 'this is a most remarkable thing; for he,' meaning you, 'said to me in this very room, sitting in that very chair, that Alexander was his only brother.' I saw that Pettigrew resented your concealing the existence of your brother Henry from him, so I thought the most friendly thing I could do was to tell him that your reticence was doubtless due to the unhappy state of poor Henry's private affairs. Naturally in the circumstances you did not want to talk about Henry." [...] I shook Scudamour by the hand, telling him that he had acted judiciously; but if I could have stabbed him in the back at that moment I dare say I would have done it.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian, Nasrallah commented on the charges he was facing by saying: [...] "I was completely shocked,I {{did not know how}} to respond. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> at that moment was that I needed to finish the book I was working on before things got worse. But I was unable to continue writing. I was confused and angry and also afraid." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{sessions}} at Monnow Valley were costing £800 a day. As the sessions proved increasingly fruitless, the group began to panic. Arthurs said, [...] "Noel was frantically {{on the phone}} to the management, going, 'This ain't working.' For it not to be happening was a bit frightening." [...] Batchelor was relieved of his duties, and Gallagher tried {{to make use of the}} music already recorded by taking the tapes to a number of London studios. Tim Abbot of Creation Records said while visiting the band in Chiswick, [...] "McGee, Noel, me and various people had a great sesh, and we listened to it over and over again. And <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> was, 'It ain't got the attack.' There was no immediacy." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Someone {{was quite}} {{interested}} in these words. They kept referring to them: they called them bad, dirty, filthy, foul, vile, vulgar, coarse, in poor taste, unseemly, street talk, gutter talk, locker room language, barracks talk, bawdy, naughty, saucy, raunchy, rude, crude, lewd, lascivious, indecent, profane, obscene, blue, off-color, risqué, suggestive, cursing, cussing, swearing... and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was: shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "While I was there, I {{was just}} {{gathering}} images and names, and ideas and rhythms, and I was storing {{all of these}} things ... in my mind somewhere. And {{when it was time to}} sit down and write songs, when I reached into the attic to see what I was gonna write about, that's what was there. I just felt a strong passion toward the discovery of going there, and it opened my eyes, and all my senses were overwhelmed by the feeling of that place.

5000|$|Joel Keller of The Huffington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "as {{the kids from}} that third-grade class praised Michael and told him how much his gift meant to them, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> was, 'this is so wrong.' ... The pain on Michael's face was palpable. I had the same expression." [...] He, however, was more {{critical}} of the episode's subplot, noting that he was [...] "getting tired of Dwight's diabolical plans". He felt that Jim should have caught onto Dwight's plan, rather than fall for it. Keller ultimately concluded that the episode was [...] "a solid job this week.

[...] "I do distinctly--and in spite of my having done <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of--to make him capable of a greater. I've done, earnestly, everything I could--I've made it, month after month, my study. But I haven't succeeded--it has been vividly brought home to me to-night. However," [...] she pursued, [...] "I've hoped against hope, for I recognise that, as I told you at the time, I was duly warned." [...] And then as she met in her friend's face the absence of any such remembrance: [...] "He did tell me that he wanted me just BECAUSE <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be useful about her." [...] With which Charlotte broke into a wonderful smile. [...] "So you see I AM!" ...|$|R

Once touted as the next big thing, his is a story of the almost made it, a tale of the machinations of the music industry, dropped in the 1970s, only to experience a resurrection since the early 2000s, that has included influencing emerging artists like Long.His are piano-driven pop ballads that I would liken to early Elton John with a bit of Bowie. The songs have a slight glam, show-tunes touch, but they don’t feel dated or twee — instead, it's mood-enhancing music with a story to tell, songs that you feel you've known your whole life.|$|R
