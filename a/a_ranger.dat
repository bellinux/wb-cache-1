5|$|Backcountry hiking is {{available}} in the Craters of the Moon Wilderness and the much larger Backcountry Area beyond (added in 2000).

All overnight backcountry hikes require registration with <b>a</b> <b>ranger.</b> No drinking water {{is available}} in the backcountry and the dry climate quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, camp fires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the wilderness area.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left {{a legacy of}} policies and practices that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks.

The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed <b>a</b> <b>ranger</b> force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
