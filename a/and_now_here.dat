He persisted by {{deepening}} the things which Cézanne wanted to do, {{but it was too}} hard a task for him: it killed him. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>here</b> we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.|$|E

500|$|On 8December the Norwegians passed Shackleton's Farthest South {{record of}} 88°23′. As they neared the pole, they looked for any {{break in the}} {{landscape}} that might indicate another expedition had got there ahead of them. While camped on 12 December they were momentarily alarmed by a black object that appeared on the horizon, but this proved to be their own dogs' droppings off in the distance, magnified by mirage. Next day they camped at 89°45′S, [...] from the pole. On the following day, 14December 1911, with the concurrence of his comrades Amundsen travelled {{in front of the}} sledges, and at around 3pm the party reached the vicinity of the South Pole. They planted the Norwegian flag and named the polar plateau [...] "King Haakon VII's Plateau". Amundsen later reflected on the irony of his achievement: [...] "Never has a man achieved a goal so diametrically opposed to his wishes. The area around the North Pole—devil take it—had fascinated me since childhood, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>here</b> I was at the South Pole. Could anything be more crazy?" ...|$|E

McRee days) for the [...] "cloth covered, block tin oval shaped Yankee canteen" [...] they found. Federal blankets, shelter halves, hats (which Matthews described as [...] "good") and overcoats were also prized by the 33rd Alabamathose who could not find them on the field, would purchase them from others who had extras.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{writing in}} Surfer magazine, Sam George summed up Blake’s accomplishments: [...] "To put it simply, because Tom Blake was, we are. The {{extraordinary}} contributions {{of this one}} man to the lifestyle we call surfing are almost impossible to gauge. They're too broad, too all-encompassing. Thomas Edward Blake's initials are {{at the root of}} so many innovations and influences as almost to be taken for granted. A dozen or so men might have eventually done everything Blake did singularly. Even a partial list of his accomplishments is overwhelming. His greatest contribution was a life - our life. Tom Blake didn't just surf, but made a life of surfing. And while the great Duke nobly represented a spiritual tie to his ancient Hawaiian sport, it was Blake who provided the modern mode for all who came after. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>here</b> we are {{at the end of the}} century - a century of surfing he shaped more than anyone - we still look like him, we still dress like him, we still surf like him." ...|$|E
