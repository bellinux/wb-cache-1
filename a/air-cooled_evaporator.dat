40|$|Carbon dioxide (R 744) {{is widely}} used as {{refrigerant}} in supermarkets located in cold weather sites thanks to its negligible environmental impact and its favourable thermo-physical properties. Due to its low critical temperature, transcritical operations in CO 2 refrigeration systems can commonly take place, increasing the energy consumption substantially. On the other hand, the high temperatures reached by the CO 2 in the high pressure heat exchanger (gas cooler) potentially allow recovering {{a large amount of}} heat at different temperature levels according to the supermarket needs. The paper deals with the energy performance evaluation of a R 744 refrigeration system, which provides the selected supermarket with DHW and heating, besides satisfying the cooling load required by the refrigerated and frozen food storage equipment. The system is equipped with an additional <b>air-cooled</b> <b>evaporator</b> which {{can be used as a}} supplemental heat source, to increase the amount of heat recovered and meet the full heating demand of the building. Different control strategies are examined in order to minimize the electric consumption and, contemporary, maximize the heat recovery...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Gregory F. Nellis, Sanford A. Klein, and Douglas T. Reindl; 288 pp. The main objective of an evaporator in any refrigeration system is to extract thermal energy from a conditioned space by recirculating air through a refrigerated coil. However, when an <b>air-cooled</b> <b>evaporator</b> operates at a temperature below the freezing point of water with a coincident entering air dew point temperature that is above the evaporator coil surface temperature, frost will form on the evaporator surface. The presence of frost reduces the performance of an evaporator and the penalty {{is proportional to the}} amount of frost that has accumulated. For this reason, the accumulated frost must be periodically removed by the use of a defrost process. A variety of methods are used to remove frost, however, the most widely-used defrost technique in industry is hot gas defrosting (HGD). The HGD technique depends on temporarily converting the evaporator to a condenser by passing hot gas through the coil; the hot gas is usually obtained directly from the compressor discharge. The HGD technique is a simple and effective method to remove frost rapidly, and the additional hardware required for the HGD process is relatively inexpensive to install. However, during the HGD process, a fraction of the energy supplied to the coil is ultimately transferred to the refrigerated in various forms and becomes a parasitic load (latent and sensible) on the refrigerated space. This additional energy added to the space must be extracted by other evaporators within the freezer space (or, if only one evaporator is in the space then the product temperature must rise). Hence, both the frosting and the defrosting processes penalize the efficiency of the cooling system. In this research, the performance of a large scale industrial evaporator operating under frosting conditions is experimentally monitored during both cooling mode (which occurs under frosting conditions) and defrost mode. Theoretical models of the evaporator coil during the cooling and the defrosting modes have been developed and validated using the experimental data. The degradation of the performance of the evaporator during the cooling mode and the parasitic heat load associated with the defrost mode are presented. The two models are used to optimize the net cooling by minimizing all the penalties associated with running the refrigeration system. Guidelines relative to the most energy efficient operation of industrial refrigeration systems are presented. Sponsored by Kuwait University...|$|E

40|$|Two-phase heat {{transfer}} is widely encountered in minichannels heat exchangers such as <b>air-cooled</b> condensers and <b>evaporators</b> for automotive, compact devices for electronic cooling, aluminum condenser for air-conditioning applications, loop heat pipes and capillary pumped loops for space applications. Nowadays {{there is also}} an increasing interest on new refrigerants, pure and blended, with a low-GWP. This thesis aims at studying the physical phenomena of condensation by investigating the effect of gravity inside small channels, presenting an experimental analysis during normal gravity and microgravity conditions. Another objective of this thesis is to analyze the two-phase {{heat transfer}} performance of non-azeotropic mixtures, with low-GWP, in minichannels. Regarding mixtures the work focused not only on condensation heat transfer but also on flow boiling and two phase pressure drop. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the design and the realization of a new test section to study the effect of gravity during convective condensation is presented. The new test section has an internal diameter of 3. 38 mm and it allows to measure quasi-local heat transfer coefficients and to visualize the flow pattern. Quasi-local heat transfer coefficients measured on ground during condensation of R 134 a at 40 Â°C and mass velocities between 50 and 200 kg m- 2 s- 1 are presented. The flow patterns visualized are compared with flow pattern maps available in the literature and the experimental heat transfer coefficients with different models for condensation. The new test section has been also used to study convective condensation in microgravity conditions during the 62 nd ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign. This has been one of the first attempts to perform heat transfer coefficients measurements and flow pattern visualizations on normal gravity and microgravity conditions during convective condensation inside tubes. The deep connection between gravity effect and flow pattern are shown in the images. Regarding on-ground applications, in the recent years much attention has been paid to the possible use of fluorinated propene isomers for the substitution of HFC fluids being in most cases high-GWP refrigerants. However, the available HFOs (hydrofluoroolefins) cannot cover all the air-conditioning, heat pump, and refrigeration systems when used as pure fluids because their thermodynamic properties are not suitable for all operating conditions; therefore some solutions may be found using blends of refrigerants, to satisfy the demand for a wide range of working conditions. The second part of this thesis presents an experimental study of the two-phase heat transfer for a R 32 /R 1234 ze(E) non-azeotropic mixture, at different mass compositions, inside a 0. 96 mm inner diameter minichannel. As first step, frictional pressure gradient during adiabatic two-phase flow has been investigated. The experimental data are also compared with several models available in the literature. Local heat transfer coefficients have been then measured during condensation of the R 32 /R 1234 ze(E) mixture at three different mass compositions (23 / 77...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MIng) [...] PU for CHE, 1999 The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a thermal cycle {{simulation}} for a micro heat pump. A feature of the simulation is that it can simulate the four qasic components in detail, based on fundamental principles. The product of this study is a simulation routine which can be used as a design tool for micro heat pumps as well as its individual components. Experimental tests were conducted on an existing R- 134 a micro heat pump. and the results were successfully used to verify the simulation routines. An extensive literature survey was conducted on heat pump component models as well as heat transfer correlations. In this study models were developed for each of the four basic components used in the micro heat pump, i. e. fluted tube water heating condenser, <b>air-cooled</b> <b>evaporator,</b> reciprocating compressor and capillary tube. The theory on which each model is based, was derived from first principles and the relevant model algorithms were developed and implemented in C++ computer routines. The component models were also integrated to allow a complete cycle simulation at different operating conditions. An advantage of the fluted tube condenser model is that it allows the surface area to be divided into any number of sections over which the change in refrigerant and water properties can be evaluated. The evaporator model calculates the change in refrigerant properties along the length of each tube in the coil. It can also predict in detail the state of the air across the coil face and along the depth of the coil. A model for simulating the compressor was derived which solves for both the mass flow rate and the refrigerant outlet conditions. Two capillary tube models were implemented. The first was based on a theoretical model obtained in the literature. This model did not provide sufficiently accurate results, however the second capillary tube model was based on a dimensional analysis providing a non-dimensional correlation for the mass flow rate. The coefficients of the correlation had to be modified for this application. The individual component models as well as the integrated cycle were both verified by means of the experimental data. The verification study showed that for the integrated cycle the condenser and evaporator heat transfer rates were predicted with average accuracies of 97 % and 96 % respectively. The refrigerant mass flow rates predicted by the compressor and the capillary tube models resulted in an average accuracy of 95 %. The high degree of accuracy obtained with the individual models as well as with the integrated cycle provides confidence in the simulation results. The simulation can therefore be applied as a design tool for micro heat pumps and its individual components. Master...|$|E
