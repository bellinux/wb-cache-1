5|$|The {{legacy of}} the herbal extends beyond {{medicine}} to botany and horticulture. Herbal medicine is still practiced {{in many parts of}} the world but the traditional grand herbal, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>here,</b> ended with the European Renaissance, the rise of modern medicine and the use of synthetic and industrialized drugs. The medicinal component of herbals has developed in several ways. Firstly, discussion of plant lore was reduced and with the increased medical content there emerged the official pharmacopoeia. The first British Pharmacopoeia was published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. Secondly, at a more popular level, there are the books on culinary herbs and herb gardens, medicinal and useful plants. Finally, the enduring desire for simple medicinal information on specific plants has resulted in contemporary herbals that echo the herbals of the past, an example being Maud Grieve's A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931 but with many subsequent editions.|$|E

For example, Cicero, Voltaire and René Descartes all used timepieces in arguments regarding purpose.

25|$|The {{addition}} of a strong reducing agent, such as ascorbic acid, to a sulfide-containing solution is sometimes used to prevent sulfide oxidation from atmospheric oxygen.

25|$|Before postal codes <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>here</b> were used, {{large cities}} were often divided into postal zones or postal districts, usually {{numbered}} from 1 upwards within each city. The newer postal code systems often incorporate the old zone numbers, as with London postal district numbers, for example. Ireland still uses postal district numbers in Dublin. In New Zealand, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch {{were divided into}} postal zones, but these fell into disuse, and have now become redundant {{as a result of}} a new postcode system being introduced.|$|E

2500|$|Both notions, <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>here,</b> are {{somewhat}} vague, {{and indeed the}} precise formulation of these principles is controversial. An additional aspect of minimalist thought {{is the idea that}} the derivation of syntactic structures should be uniform; that is, rules should not be stipulated as applying at arbitrary points in a derivation, but instead apply throughout derivations. Minimalist approaches to phrase structure have resulted in [...] "Bare Phrase Structure," [...] an attempt to eliminate X-bar theory.|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{hunting with}} hounds, as a formalised activity, {{originated}} in England {{in the sixteenth}} century, in a form {{very similar to that}} practised until February 2005, when a law banning the activity in England and Wales came into force. A ban on hunting in Scotland had been passed in 2002, but it continues to be within the law in Northern Ireland and several other countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, and the United States. In Australia, the term also refers to the hunting of foxes with firearms, similar to deer hunting or spotlighting. In much of the world, hunting in general is understood to relate to any game animals or weapons (e.g., deer hunting with bow and arrow); in Britain and Ireland, [...] "hunting" [...] without qualification implies fox hunting (or other forms of hunting with hounds—beagling, drag hunting, hunting the clean boot, mink hunting, [...] or stag hunting), <b>as</b> <b>described</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
