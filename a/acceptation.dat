25|$|Beginning in 1990, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints debated how Padre Pio {{had lived}} his life, and in 1997 Pope Saint John Paul II {{declared}} him venerable. A {{discussion of the}} effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's intercession. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad <b>acceptation</b> of the contested saint in spe in society.|$|E

He may however have been misled by the massing of the Prussian troops between the salient point of the position, Saint-Amand, and the road in question, {{as well as by the}} direction of the line of the occupied villages of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact, that Blücher did rely upon the arrival of a portion of Wellington's forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} Macedonian king Amyntas I {{surrendered}} his {{country to the}} Persians in about 512-511 BCE, Macedonians and Persians were strangers no more. Subjugation of Macedonia was part of Persian military operations initiated by Darius the Great (521–486). In 513 - after immense preparations - a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the European Scythians roaming {{to the north of}} the Danube river. Darius' army subjugated several Thracian peoples, and virtually all other regions that touch the European part of the Black Sea, such as parts of nowadays Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius left in Europe one of his commanders named Megabazus whose task was to accomplish conquests in the Balkans. The Persian troops subjugated gold-rich Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating and conquering the powerful Paeonians. Finally, Megabazus sent envoys to Amyntas, demanding <b>acceptation</b> of Persian domination, which the Macedonian accepted. Following the Ionian Revolt, the Persian hold over the Balkans loosened, but was firmly restored in 492 BC through the campaigns of Mardonius. The Balkans, including what is nowadays Bulgaria, provided many soldiers for the multi ethnic Achaemenid army. Several Thracian treasures dating from the Persian rule in Bulgaria have been found. Most of what is today Bulgaria remained firmly under the Persian sway until 479 BC. The Persian garrison at Doriscus in Thrace held out for many years even after the Persian defeat, and reportedly never surrendered. It remained as the last Persian stronghold in Europe.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHow is it {{possible}} for Foucault to present the body {{at the same time as}} the foundation and the result of history, as condition and horizon of the theory that takes hold of it ? One has to pay attention to the various registers in which Foucault distributes the <b>acceptations</b> ordinarily confused with the general notion of the body : from "my body" (as it appears in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology) to "the body' (as it is understood by modern medicine); from this body as an object for positive explanation and disciplinary, to the speaking and spoken body described in The Will of Knowledge; and from those <b>acceptations,</b> which take place in an history of the individual body, to the plurality of bodies that intervene, as a background, in Foucault's ethics...|$|R

Free will enters as follows: Free will is an [...] "appetitive power", that is, not a cognitive power of intellect (the term [...] "appetite" [...] from Aquinas's definition [...] "includes all forms of internal inclination").

2500|$|This word breviary (Lat. Breviarium), signifies in {{its primary}} <b>acceptation</b> an abridgment, or a compendium. It is often {{employed}} {{in this sense}} by Christian authors, e.g. Breviarium fidei, Breviarium in psalmos, Breviarium canonum, Breviarium regularum. In liturgical language Breviary has a special meaning, indicating a book furnishing the regulations for the celebration of Mass or the canonical Office, and may be met with under the titles Breviarium Ecclesiastici Ordinis, or Breviarium Ecclesiæ Rominsæ (Romanæ). In the ninth century Alcuin uses the word to designate an office abridged or simplified {{for the use of}} the laity. Prudentius of Troyes, about the same period, composed a Breviarium Psalterii (v. inf. V. HISTORY). In an ancient inventory occurs Breviarium Antiphonarii, meaning [...] "Extracts from the Antiphonary".

Since then, the words collaboration and collaborateur may have this very pejorative meaning in French (and the abbreviation collabo has only this pejorative and insulting meaning).
