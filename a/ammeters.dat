2500|$|The {{control room}} also had switchboards, {{a row of}} four periscopes, manometers, {{frequency}} gauges, voltmeters and <b>ammeters,</b> green/red/white signal lamps, and switches at the propulsion console and guidance panel to dynamically display approximately 15 measurement points within the rocket. Additionally, the control room had a big [...] "X-time" [...] countdown clock that display the time until launch, which was announced via loudspeakers as [...] "X minus four minutes", etc. [...] In addition to the control room, the blockhouse also contained offices, a conference room, a small dormitory with double bunks and an adjoining shower, a wash room, and a workshop. A long underground corridor led from the measurement blockhouse to {{a room in the}} concrete foundation by the flame pit, and multiple rows of measurement cables covered the walls of the tunnel. A different gradually rising tunnel led from the long flame pit room to the exterior of the arena near the pumphouse (...) [...] Near the pumphouse were high wooden towers to cool the water, and [...] high tanks for the recooling water were integrated into the ellipse wall.|$|E

Currently {{embedded}} software reliability testing of intellectual <b>ammeter</b> is through software comparison, which has poor scalability and can’t detect software’s fault tolerance ability after failure in running scene. In this regard, {{this paper presents}} a detection platform’s construction scheme for intellectual <b>ammeter</b> software reliability testing and designs testing communication protocol based on Ethernet master-slave mode.

50|$|Since the <b>ammeter</b> shunt has a {{very low}} resistance, mistakenly wiring the <b>ammeter</b> in {{parallel}} with a voltage source will cause a short circuit, at best blowing a fuse, possibly damaging the instrument and wiring, and exposing an observer to injury.|$|R
50|$|Moving magnet <b>ammeters</b> {{operate on}} {{essentially}} the same principle as moving coil, except that the coil is mounted in the meter case, and a permanent magnet moves the needle. Moving magnet <b>Ammeters</b> are able to carry larger currents than moving coil instruments, often several tens of Amperes, because the coil can be made of thicker wire and the current {{does not have to}} be carried by the hairsprings.Indeed, some <b>Ammeters</b> of this type do not have hairsprings at all, instead using a fixed permanent magnet to provide the restoring force.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of <b>ammeters</b> are either connected {{in series with}} the circuit carrying the current to be measured (for small fractional amperes), or have their shunt resistors connected similarly in series. In either case, the current passes through the meter or (mostly) through its shunt. <b>Ammeters</b> must not be connected directly across a voltage source since their internal resistance is very low and excess current would flow. <b>Ammeters</b> are designed for a low voltage drop across their terminals, much less than one volt; the extra circuit losses produced by the ammeter are called its [...] "burden" [...] on the measured circuit.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, an <b>ammeter</b> may be fitted. This {{indicates}} {{whether the}} battery is being charged or discharged. In {{the picture on}} the right, the <b>ammeter</b> is marked [...] "Alternator" [...] and the symbols are [...] "C" [...] (charge) and [...] "D" [...] (discharge).|$|R

40|$|A galvanometer, {{which is}} {{sensitive}} to small electrical currents, {{can be used as}} either a voltmeter or an <b>ammeter</b> by wiring it in the appropriate manner. The setup used for this demonstration is shown in Figure 1. When a small resistance is wired in parallel with the galvanometer, it functions as an <b>ammeter,</b> as in Figure 2. The <b>ammeter</b> is used to measure the current in several circuits. When a large resistance is wired in series with the galvanometer, it functions as a voltmeter, as in Figure 3. The voltmeter is used to measure the terminal voltage of several batteries...|$|R

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{range of}} devices {{referred}} to as integrating <b>ammeters.</b> In these <b>ammeters</b> the current is summed over time, giving {{as a result the}} product of current and time; which is proportional to the electrical charge transferred with that current. These can be used for metering energy (the charge needs to be multiplied by the voltage to give energy) or for estimating the charge of a battery or capacitor.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{moving coil}} {{voltmeter}} and <b>ammeter</b> itself takes a small current and thus loads the circuit {{to which it}} is attached. This can significantly alter the operating conditions in the circuit being measured.

50|$|Both the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 {{feature the}} new unit {{construction}} engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively. However the Classic 350 uses a carburettor for fuel delivery and the Classic 500 has EFI. Also the Classic 350 has an <b>ammeter</b> while the Classic 500 {{has a low}} fuel indicator light and engine check light instead of the <b>ammeter.</b> The <b>ammeter</b> on the Classic 350 {{is more of a}} vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the top dead centre (CB Points closed) then the <b>ammeter</b> would stay in the middle. This feature allowed the rider to use the decompresson lever to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500.|$|R
50|$|Zero-center <b>ammeters</b> {{are used}} for {{applications}} requiring current to be measured with both polarities, common in scientific and industrial equipment. Zero-center <b>ammeters</b> are also commonly placed in series with a battery. In this application, the charging of the battery deflects the needle {{to one side of}} the scale (commonly, the right side) and the discharging of the battery deflects the needle to the other side. A special type of zero-center ammeter for testing high currents in cars and trucks has a pivoted bar magnet that moves the pointer, and a fixed bar magnet to keep the pointer centered with no current. The magnetic field around the wire carrying current to be measured deflects the moving magnet.|$|E

50|$|Ayrton shunt or {{universal}} shunt is a high-resistance shunt used in galvanometers {{to increase}} their range without changing the damping.The circuit is named after its inventor William E. Ayrton. Multirange <b>ammeters</b> that use this technique are more accurate than those using a make-before-break switch. Also it will eliminate the possibility of having a meter without a shunt which is a serious concern in make-before-break switches.|$|E
50|$|The test is {{conducted}} on the high-voltage (HV) side of the transformer where the low-voltage (LV) side or the secondary is short circuited. A wattmeter {{is connected to the}} primary. An <b>ammeter</b> is connected in series with the primary winding. A voltmeter is optional since the applied voltage {{is the same as the}} voltmeter reading. The LV side of the transformer is short circuited. Now with the help of variac applied voltage is slowly increased until the <b>ammeter</b> gives reading equal to the rated current of the HV side. After reaching at rated current of HV side, all three instruments reading (Voltmeter, <b>Ammeter</b> and Watt-meter readings) are recorded. The <b>ammeter</b> reading gives the primary equivalent of full load current IL. As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the iron losses in transformer can be taken as negligible here.|$|R
