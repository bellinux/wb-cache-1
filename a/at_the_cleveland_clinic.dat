When Saban came to Miami, the football team had won just five games in the previous two seasons.|$|E

25|$|In 1960 F.

50|$|The BioMEMS and Renal Nanotechnology Laboratories <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic's</b> Lerner Research Institute {{have focused}} on {{advancing}} membrane technology to develop an implantable or wearable therapy for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Current dialysis cartridges are too large and require superphysiologic pressures for blood circulation, and pores in current polymer membranes have too broad of a size distribution and irregular features. Manufacturing a silicon, nanoporous membrane with narrow pore size distributions improves the membrane's ability to discriminate between filtered and retained molecules. It also increases hydraulic permeability by allowing the mean pore size to approach the desired cutoff of the membrane. Using a batch-fabrication process allows for strict control over pore size distribution and geometry.|$|R
40|$|To {{ascertain}} the prevalence and reversibility of the hepatopulmonary syndrome, we reviewed {{the cases of}} 98 patients undergoing liver transplantation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cleveland</b> (Ohio) <b>Clinic</b> Foundation from June 1988 through July 1992 and identified 4 patients with clinically recognized hepatopulmonary syndrome (prevalence 4 %). All 4 patients ultimately had complete reversal of their disorder. As reviewed herein, the prevalence of the hepatopulmonary syndrome in the current series is lower than in previous reports, possibly reflecting a dependence on its clinical recognition in this series rather than the use of routine screening tests. This report confirms previous experience that the hepatopulmonary syndrome may be reversible after transplantation. ...|$|R

25|$|The Batista {{procedure}} {{was invented by}} Brazilian surgeon Randas Batista in 1994 for use in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. It involves removal of a portion of viable tissue from the left ventricle to reduce its size (partial left ventriculectomy), with or without repair or replacement of the mitral valve. Although several studies showed benefits from this surgery, studies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic</b> concluded that this {{procedure was}} associated with a high early and late failure rate. At 3 years only 26 percent were event-free and survival rate was only 60 percent. Most hospitals have abandoned this operation and it is no longer included in heart failure guidelines.|$|E

40|$|Healthcare {{delivery}} in the United States exists <b>at</b> varying levels. <b>The</b> <b>Cleveland</b> <b>Clinic,</b> Johns Hopkins, Kaiser, and the Mayo Clinic are noted for typically providing world class care. However, there also exist several instances of inferior delivery of care, mostly {{as a result}} of inefficient and ineffective processes which in turn result in poor access and low quality. One segment of the community that continues to suffer from issues pertaining to poor access and low quality is the American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) population. Such a situation is clearly untenable, especially given the plethora of tools, techniques, technologies, and tactics afforded by today&# 039;s knowledge economy. In this chapter, we proffer a model incorporating a system of systems approach in order to streamline process flows and thereby provide better healthcare delivery to Native American patients. We note that while this chapter specifically focuses on the case study of Native American patients we strongly urge for the incorporation of a system of systems perspective in all areas of healthcare delivery...|$|R

[...] Despite having been cleared earlier to play in the pre-season by two sets of doctors, the Cleveland Clinic judged him unfit to play for a month. Previously undetected nerve damage in one leg was also revealed. Due to Hodgson's misdiagnosis, which was not corrected until a year later, subsequent treatment and rehabilitation was designed for a bulging disc, which further aggravated his real injury – a muscle strain.|$|E
