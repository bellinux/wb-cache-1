The bid auction (buyers propose prices), offer auction (sellers suggest prices) and double auction (both trader types initiate price quotes) make up the electoral candidates.

The former allows each trader to vote for, at most, one auction, whereas approval voting permits voters to either abstain or to vote for one, two or all three institutional alternatives. The main result is threefold. <b>First,</b> <b>plurality</b> rule induces <b>a</b> Duverger effect {{in the sense that}} only the bid and offer auctions emerge as viable auctions. Approval voting instead leads to close three-way races with each of the three auctions winning approximately one third of the elections.

The discursive presentation of certain actions or beliefs as normal at the same time constitutes their performers or holders as normal people.
