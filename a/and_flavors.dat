5|$|Alanis Morissette is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter and {{musician}} from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Morissette {{has released}} five studio albums internationally through Maverick Records: Jagged Little Pill (1995), Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), <b>and</b> <b>Flavors</b> of Entanglement (2008). Jagged Little Pill, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, and Under Rug Swept debuted at {{number one on}} the Billboard 200, and were among the top five on the Canadian Top 50 Album Chart. After leaving Maverick, Morissette released her most recent album, Havoc and Bright Lights (2012) independently via Collective Sounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to ripeness levels, the harvest yields {{can also have}} a strong influence in the resulting quality <b>and</b> <b>flavors</b> of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavors more on the green or herbaceous side. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after veraison.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas <b>and</b> <b>flavors.</b> It is common for Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed by earlier bottling.|$|E

40|$|Plants {{produce a}} diverse {{repertoire}} of specialized metabolites that have multiple roles throughout their life cycle. Some of these metabolites are essential {{components of the}} aroma <b>and</b> <b>flavor</b> of flowers <b>and</b> fruits. Unfortunately, attempts to increase the yield and prolong the shelf life of crops have generally been associated with reduced levels of volatile specialized metabolites and hence with decreased aroma <b>and</b> <b>flavor.</b> Thus, {{there is a need}} for the development of new varieties that will retain their desired traits while gaining enhanced scent <b>and</b> <b>flavor.</b> Metabolic engineering holds great promise as a tool for improving the profile of emitted volatiles of domesticated crops. This mini review discusses recent attempts to utilize metabolic engineering of the phenylpropanoid and its primary precursor pathway to enhance the aroma <b>and</b> <b>flavor</b> of flowers <b>and</b> fruits...|$|R
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles <b>and</b> <b>flavors</b> were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could be had virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E

25|$|Detecting an aroma is {{only part}} of wine tasting. The next step is to {{describe}} or communicate what that aroma is and it is in this step that the subjective nature of wine tasting appears. Different individuals have their own way of describing familiar scents and aromas based on their unique experiences. Furthermore, there are varying levels of sensitivity and recognition thresholds among humans of some aromatic compounds. This is why one taster may describe different aromas <b>and</b> <b>flavors</b> from another taster sampling the very same wine.|$|E
25|$|In the {{processing}} of edible oils, the oil is heated under vacuum to near the smoke point, and water is introduced {{at the bottom of}} the oil. The water immediately is converted to steam, which bubbles through the oil, carrying with it any chemicals which are water-soluble. The steam sparging removes impurities that can impart unwanted flavors and odors to the oil. Deodorization is key to the manufacture of vegetable oils. Nearly all soybean, corn, and canola oils found on supermarket shelves go through a deodorization stage that removes trace amounts of odors <b>and</b> <b>flavors,</b> and lightens the color of the oil.|$|E

25|$|Ice cream (derived {{from earlier}} iced cream or cream ice) is a {{sweetened}} frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It is usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream, and often combined with fruits or other ingredients <b>and</b> <b>flavors.</b> It is typically {{sweetened with sugar}} or sugar substitutes. Typically, flavourings and colourings are added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is stirred to incorporate air spaces and cooled below the freezing point of water to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (<nbsp&). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.|$|E

Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (e.g., eggs, hearts, coins) have become traditional on certain Western holidays, such as Easter, Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.|$|E
