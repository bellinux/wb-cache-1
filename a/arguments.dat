There are different styles of <b>argument</b> map but they are often functionally equivalent and represent an <b>argument's</b> individual claims and the relationships between them.|$|R

First, the <b>argument</b> structures based on types of complexity comprise a simple <b>argument</b> structure and a complex <b>argument</b> structure. The complex <b>argument</b> structure consists of an adjacent <b>argument</b> structure and a multi-layer <b>argument</b> structure.

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. <b>Arguments</b> from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. <b>Arguments</b> from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. <b>Arguments</b> from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|The <b>arguments</b> for {{evolution}} being {{a religion}} generally amount to <b>arguments</b> by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such <b>arguments</b> are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{scientific}} literacy {{has led to}} a steady increase in argument-based interventions in science education contexts. It has been suggested that student participation in <b>argument</b> develops communication skills, metacognitive aware-ness, critical thinking, an understanding of the culture and practice of science, and scientific literacy. Although <b>argument</b> does influence communication skills, metacognition, and critical thinking, not all forms of <b>argument</b> promote an under-standing {{of scientific}} practice and, subsequently, scientific literacy. This study of 54 articles from the research literature examines how <b>argument</b> interventions promote scientific literacy. Articles were classified across three domains to deter-mine structural patterns of the various <b>argument</b> interventions: (a) the nature of the <b>argument</b> activity, (b) the emphasis of the <b>argument</b> activity, and (c) the aspects of science included in the <b>argument</b> activity. The structures of the interventions suggest that researchers approach learning of <b>argument</b> through immersion, teaching the structure of <b>argument,</b> and emphasizing the interaction of science and society. Immersion-oriented interventions utilized <b>argument</b> as an integrated component to student investigations. <b>Argument</b> structure interventions taught the structure of <b>argument</b> separate from investigations and asked students to apply it across various explanatory activities. Science- and society-based interventions used socioscientific issues to contextualize and provide purpose for <b>argument.</b> The three orientations toward <b>argument</b> instruction are discussed in light of the epistemic nature of science and scientific literacy. The orientations can serve as an opportunity to refine understanding of <b>argument</b> interventions, particularly with regard to the pursuit of scientific literacy...|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of a formal fallacy in a deductive <b>argument</b> does not imply anything about the <b>argument's</b> premises or its conclusion.
