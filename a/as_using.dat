40|$|Recent {{reports from}} needle {{exchange}} programmes {{and other public}} health initiatives have suggested growing use of anabolic steroids (AS) in the UK and other countries. Data indicate that <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> {{is not confined to}} bodybuilders or high-level sportsmen. Use has spread to professionals working in emergency services, casual fitness enthusiasts and subelite sportsmen and women. Although the precise health consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> is largely undefined, <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> represents a growing public health concern. Data regarding the consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> on cardiovascular health are limited to case studies and a modest number of small cohort studies. Numerous case studies have linked <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> with a variety of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events or endpoints, including myocardial infarction, stroke and death. Large-scale epidemiological studies to support these links are absent. Consequently, the impact of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> upon known CVD risk factors has been studied in relatively small, case-series studies. Data relating <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> to elevated blood pressure, altered lipid profiles and ECG abnormalities have been reported, but are often limited in scope, and other studies have often produced equivocal outcomes. The <b>use</b> of <b>AS</b> has been linked to the appearance of concentric left ventricular hypertrophy as well as endothelial dysfunction but the data again remains controversial. The mechanisms responsible for the negative effect of AS on cardiovascular health are poorly understood, especially in humans. Possibilities include direct effects on myocytes and endothelial cells, reduced intracellular Ca 2 + levels, increased release of apoptogenic factors, as well as increased collagen crosslinks between myocytes. New data relating <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> to cardiovascular health risks are emerging, as novel technologies are developed (especially in non-invasive imaging) that can assess physiological structure and function. Continued efforts to fully document the cardiovascular health consequences of <b>AS</b> <b>use</b> is important to provide a clear, accurate, public health message to the many groups now <b>using</b> <b>AS</b> for performance and image enhancement...|$|R

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated <b>as</b> <b>using</b> fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants. They communicate with the ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well <b>as</b> <b>using</b> chemical signals.

5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such <b>as</b> <b>using</b> illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Magic can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E
