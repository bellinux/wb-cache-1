5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by reindeer husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer. The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with reindeer husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

50|$|The <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita autumnata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is found {{throughout}} the Palearctic region and the Near East and has a much wider distribution than its two close relatives (see below).

30|$|In {{northern}} Utsjoki, mass {{outbreaks of}} <b>autumnal</b> <b>moths</b> {{have been documented}} for 1844, 1905, 1909, 1927, 1957, 1965 and 1966 (Holtmeier et al. 2003). One herder recollected the following from the 1950 s: “I remember this time, I was less than 20  years old… My late father {{told me that the}} area was eaten some 35  years ago, and there were only stumps of this height left; nothing had grown afterwards. This was around 1920 – 1930, and no new trees have grown back in this area” (M 2). This story most likely refers to the moth outbreak of 1927.|$|R
30|$|Geometrid moths and semi-domesticated {{reindeer}} {{are both}} herbivores which feed on birch {{leaves in the}} subarctic mountain birch forests in northern Fennoscandia. The caterpillars of <b>autumnal</b> and winter <b>moths</b> have episodic outbreaks, which can occasionally lead to extensive defoliation of birch forests. Earlier {{studies have shown that}} reindeer {{have a negative effect on}} the regeneration of defoliated birches by grazing and browsing their seedlings and sprouts.|$|R
30|$|A {{few years}} after a mass moth outbreak, wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa) colonized the soil around the birches due to the {{combined}} impact of nutrients from moth larva faeces, increased light reaching the ground {{after the death of}} the birch canopy and decreased competition given that the larvae also destroy the dominant dwarf shrubs (Rybråten and Hovelsrud 2010). As a herder from Kaldoaivi explained: “It went like this; first there was lichen, then <b>autumnal</b> <b>moths</b> ate the buds, then there was grass, this height; the grass killed the lichen. Our reindeer were really fat; then the grass ran out and mosses came, which meant no more nutrition (M 6). As new forage appeared, the reindeer had no need to make any immediate changes. After 4 to 10  years, however, the disappearance of the grass affected the movements of the female reindeer and each year they had to enlarge their foraging areas. Changing the pasture rotation is a slow process, as seen in Abisko, Sweden, where the damaged pastures were abandoned slowly (Van Bogaert et al. 2011). Both the moth outbreaks and border closures were more serious and permanent incidents than the occasional harsh winter weather. Negotiations were conducted and new arrangements made between the siidas, which were forced to change their nomadic routes. In the worst case, the herders started to lose their reindeer for good. Reindeer took on the role from the moths as key constructor of the shared niche and modified their own forage resources by depleting them. Moths first destroyed the primary grazing lands of reindeer, after which the reindeer, as flexible herbivores, carried on the destruction by browsing the damaged birch trees and later grazing on the new grass that appeared. Because parts of the niche were abandoned, the reindeer were forced to extend their pasture rotation to new lands. Here one can see a niche being constructed in a positive way by the action of an animal itself.|$|R

40|$|Cyclic {{outbreaks}} of forest moth pest species have long remained a puzzle for foresters and ecologists. This paper presents time-series exhibiting a strong {{negative relationship between}} sunspot numbers and population indices of <b>autumnal</b> and winter <b>moths,</b> both in a mountain birch forest in central Norway and in a mixed lowland forest in southern Norway. In the latter area, also the population level of a moth species feeding entirely on lichens was negatively related to sunspot numbers. Low sunspot activity leads to a thinner ozone layer and thus higher surface ultraviolet (UV) -B radiation. As winter moth larvae prefer leaves subjected to enhanced UV-B radiation, we suggest that the causal relationship between sunspots and moths is that the metabolic costs of producing UV-B-protective pigments during periods of low sunspot activity reduce trees' and lichens' resistance to herbivores, and thus increase the survival of moth larvae. Higher peak densities of moth cycles in mountain forests {{could be explained by}} the general higher UV-B radiation at higher altitudes...|$|R

3000|$|The {{value of}} Sámi {{reindeer}} herders’ professional knowledge and/or indigenous knowledge (IK) has been acknowledged particularly when herding communities {{have been subjected}} to uncertain conditions (Tyler et al. 2007; Saijets and Helander-Renvall 2009; Riseth et al. 2010; Vuojala-Magga et al. 2011; Vuojala-Magga 2012; Syrjämäki and Mustonen 2013; Helander-Renvall 2014). Although reindeer herding {{has been one of the}} key activities in the mountain birch forests, there are only few studies in which Sámi herders’ IK has been integrated with scientific studies in biology, and particularly few in which the interaction between geometrid moths, mountain birches and reindeer grazing has been examined (Rybråten and Hovelsrud 2010). The caterpillars of <b>autumnal</b> and winter <b>moths</b> have episodic outbreaks which can occasionally lead to extensive defoliation of birch forests in Northern Fennoscandia (Tenow 1972; Kallio and Lehtonen 1975; Lehtonen and Heikkinen 1995; Holtmeier et al. 2003). Regeneration of these forests greatly depends on the environmental conditions, including the extent of reindeer grazing (Lehtonen and Heikkinen 1995; Helle 2001, den Herder and Niemelä 2003; Cairns and Moen 2004). We apply niche construction theory (NCT) to combine indigenous knowledge (IK) of Sámi herders from two herding co-operatives in northernmost Finland - Kaldoaivi and Paistunturi – with the results of scientific studies in biology. This approach enables us to analyse the changes in the niche from the perspective of herders. The key questions are: What is the importance, as viewed through NCT, for the reindeer herding environment of birch defoliation caused by moth outbreaks? How have the niche and its tempo-spatial attributes changed during the history of reindeer herding in northernmost Finland?

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to determine the impact of climate on mountain birch (Betula pubecens ssp. czerepanovii (Orlova)) growth {{and to develop a}} regional chronology of <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks. To accomplish the objective, cores of mountain birch were taken from 21 sites in Norrbotten, Sweden. Tree-ring chronologies were developed for each site. Climatic influences were determined by correlating ring widths to climatic variables (average monthly temperature, average monthly precipitation and NAO). Outbreaks were recovered from the ring width indices using the non-host method with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)) as the non-host. This method removes the climatic influence on growth to enhance other factors. Patterns of synchrony and regional outbreaks were detected using regression and cluster analysis techniques. The primary climatic influences on the tree ring growth of mountain birch are June and July temperatures; precipitation during October is of secondary importance. Climate explained 46 % of yearly tree ring width variation. Outbreaks of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> occur at varying time intervals depending on the scale of study. Intervals between outbreaks on the tree level are twice as long as at the plot level. On the regional scale plots within the same valley had more similar outbreak intervals and magnitudes of outbreaks. Elevation is a driver in determining the length of outbreaks and length between outbreaks. The percent monocormicity of a plot is also a determining factor of the length between outbreaks. This study is the first regional scale study on climate and outbreaks of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> on mountain birch. The results complement research being conducted on <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> larval densities and will help in modeling and assessing the effects of outbreaks with increasing climatic change...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The mast {{depression}} hypothesis {{has been}} put forward to explain the 9 - to 10 -year population cycle of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita autumnata; Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in northern Fennoscandia.

Since mast seeding has been suggested to occur {{at the expense of}} chemical defence against herbivores, we bioassayed the quality of birch leaves from the same trees by means of yearly growth trials with <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> larvae.

Abisko virus has a genome organization {{similar to that of the}} insect-infecting negeviruses, but phylogenetic and compositional bias analyses also reveal strong affiliations with plant-infecting viruses, such that both the primary host origin and taxonomic identity of the virus remain in doubt. In an extensive set of larval, pupal, and adult <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) outbreak samples, the virus was only detected in a few adult E. autumnata moths as well as the single larval transcriptome.

40|$|Among cyclic {{populations of}} herbivores, inter-specific {{temporal}} synchrony has {{been attributed to}} both climatic factors and trophic interactions. In northern Europe, winter and autumnal moths undergo regular 9 – 11 year population cycles. The winter moth cycle has typically been phase-locked with that of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> but with a 1 – 3 - year phase lag. We examined potential effects of natural enemies on this phase lag using field experiments and observational data. We found that larval parasitism was significantly higher in autumnal than in winter moths. Conversely, pupal predation by generalist invertebrates was clearly greater in winter than in autumnal moths. The difference in parasitism rates may contribute to the earlier collapse of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> cycle. In addition, the phase lag may be strengthened by higher pupal mortality in winter moths in the early increase phase of the cycles. As a consequence, we put forward a hypothesis on reversed effects of natural enemies, providing a potential explanation for phase-lagged population cycles of these moth species...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{respond to}} grazing by herbivorous insects by {{emitting}} {{a range of}} volatile organic compounds, which attract parasitoids to their insect hosts. However, a positive outcome for the host plant is a necessary precondition for making the attraction beneficial or even adaptive. Parasitoids benefit plants by killing herbivorous insects, thus reducing future herbivore pressure, but also by curtailing the feeding intensity of the still living, parasitised host. In this study, the effect of parasitism on food consumption of the 5 th instar larvae of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita autumnata) was examined under laboratory conditions. Daily food consumption, {{as well as the}} duration of the 5 th instar, was measured for both parasitised and non-parasitised larvae. The results showed that parasitism by the solitary endoparasitoid Zele deceptor not only reduced leaf consumption significantly but also hastened the onset of pupation in <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> larvae. On the basis of the results, an empirical model was derived to assess the affects on the scale of the whole tree. The model suggests that parasitoids might protect the tree from total defoliation at least at intermediate larval densities. Consequently, a potential for plant–parasitoid chemical signalling appears to exist, which seems to benefit the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) by reducing the overall intensity of herbivore defoliation due to parasitism by this hymenopteran parasitoid...|$|E
40|$|In the literature, various {{environmental}} factors {{are described as}} being capable of influencing the reproductive output of insect females irrespective of their body size. Still, female body size or weight is widely used {{as a proxy for}} fecundity. In the present study, a seven-year data set on the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae), was used to analyze whether the body weight-fecundity relationship in this capital breeding, cyclic forest defoliating lepidopteran is constant across years. Ambient temperature conditions and density of conspecifics during larval development, the length of the pupal period, as well as moth densities in the parent generation were examined as factors capable of modifying the body weight-fecundity relationship. While the regression slope of potential fecundity (total egg numbers per female) on pupal mass was constant across years, the mean total egg number per given body weight (the regression intercept) was significantly different between years. This residual variance in egg numbers after controlling for the effect of pupal mass was best explained by the pooled geometrid density (autumnal and winter moths) in the parent generation. The total egg number per given body weight decreased with increasing density of geometrid moths in the parent generation. Thus, maternal density effects on offspring fecundity were found in this system. Their rather weak nature suggests, however, that this maternal effect alone does not have the potential of causing cyclic population dynamics in the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth...</b>|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} DNA-barcoding of Scandinavian {{butterflies}} and moths show high intraspecific sequence differences in the <b>Autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> E. autumnata. One theory that might explain this finding is that E. autumnata comprises of several cryptic species. In this study, Epirrita samples from different locations in Norway, and some samples from Finland and Scotland were investigated, hoping to resolve the discrepancy found between mtDNA divergence and present division to species. The Small <b>Autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> Epirrita filigrammaria, which is presumed to be endemic to Great Britain, was also examined because there is some suspicion of E. filigrammaria being an upland ecotype of the circumpolar E. autumnata. Sequencing of the mitochondrial region COI, {{as well as the}} nuclear regions ITS 2 and Wingless, was performed. Genital preparations were made to see if morphological examinations supported the results from the molecular analysis. The results from genetic and morphological analysis showed no discrimination between E. autumnata and E. filigrammaria and support the theory of E. filigrammaria being an ecotype of E. autumnata. Results from sequencing the COI region suggest five different subgroups within the E. autumnata complex, and with no geographical structure. Sequencing of the nuclear markers and the morphological examinations shows little to no variation, and gives no indications of E. autumnata comprising of more than one species. As parasitic endosymbionts like Wolbachia is common in arthropods, all samples were sequenced with WSP primers. These results showed that several samples examined in this study were infected with Wolbachia, and with different strains corresponding to two of the mtDNA haplotypes found within E. autumnata. This might indicate indirect selection/selective sweeps on haplotypes. From these findings, a likely explanation for the high variation found within E. autumnata mtDNA is that variation arisen in allopatry, has at least partially been maintained by selective sweeps from multiple Wolbachia infections...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{surface of}} birch leaves {{contains}} glandular trichomes that secrete exudates containing flavonoid aglycones. We investigated the biological activi-ties of white birch (Betula pubescens) leaf surface exudates against larvae of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth,</b> Epirrita autumnata, a common insect pest of birch. We found that tree-specific mortality (up to 100 %) of first instar larvae correlated strongly with the tree-specific contents of surface flavonoid aglycones (rs = 0. 905) in emerging leaves. We {{also found that}} first instars clearly preferred birch buds from which surface exudates had been removed. In addition, {{the duration of the}} first instar was shortened by 29 %, and the weights and relative growth rates of first instars improved by 8 % and 52 %, respectively, as a result of removal of the exudates from their leaf diet. The correlation of tree-specific foliar con-tents of flavonoid aglycones, especially 5 -hydroxy- 4 ′, 7 -dimethoxyflavanone, with changes in larval performance, suggests that flavonoid aglycones are re-sponsible for the changes observed in first instar larval performance.

40|$|Variation in {{ring width}} in tree ring series of {{mountain}} birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) was analyzed {{and related to}} climate and herbivory. The effects of different defoliation levels were studied from natural outbreaks of the <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> (Epirrita autumnata) and from experimental defoliations. Short-term variation in ring width was mainly positively correlated with the current year July followed by June temperature. A warm May resulted in wider rings, probably due to earlier budburst.

The remaining foliage in the experiment showed increased photosynthetic capacity related to increased nitrogen content; this is presumably an important factor in maintaining growth performance after defoliation. Even after a defoliation level of 84 % only a one-year reduction in stem growth was observed, but a slightly higher defoliation level (93 %) resulted in a growth reduction during at least 4 years, which indicates that the defoliationgrowth relationship is non- linear.

The present study focused on three closely-related geometrid moth species, autumnal Epirrita autumnata, winter Operophtera brumata and northern winter moths Operophtera fagata, in southern Finland. There, winter and northern winter moth populations can reach outbreak densities, whereas <b>autumnal</b> <b>moth</b> densities stay relatively low. We tested the hypothesis that a lower vulnerability to pupal predation may explain the observed differences in population dynamics. The results obtained do not support this hypothesis because pupal predation probabilities were not significantly different between the two genera within or without the Operophtera outbreak area or in years with or without a current Operophtera outbreak. Overall, pupal predation was even higher in winter and northern winter moths than in autumnal moths. Differences in larval predation and parasitism, {{as well as in the}} reproductive capacities of the species, might be other candidates...|$|E
