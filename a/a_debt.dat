During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
