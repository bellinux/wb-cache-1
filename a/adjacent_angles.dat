25|$|The {{equality}} of vertically opposite angles {{is called the}} vertical angle theorem. Eudemus of Rhodes attributed the proof to Thales of Miletus. The proposition showed that since both {{of a pair of}} vertical angles are supplementary to both of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>angles,</b> the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note, when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles {{to make sure that they}} were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.|$|E
25|$|In the figure, {{assume the}} measure of Angle A = x. When two <b>adjacent</b> <b>angles</b> form a {{straight}} line, they are supplementary. Therefore, {{the measure of}} Angle C = 180 − x. Similarly, the measure of Angle D = 180 − x. Both Angle C and Angle D have measures equal to 180 − x and are congruent. Since Angle B is supplementary to both Angles C and D, either of these angle measures {{may be used to}} determine the measure of Angle B. Using the measure of either Angle C or Angle D we find the measure of Angle B = 180 − (180 − x) = 180 − 180 + x = x. Therefore, both Angle A and Angle B have measures equal to x and are equal in measure.|$|E
