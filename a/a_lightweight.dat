5|$|Hinton {{spent most}} of the next several years on the West Coast working in {{railroad}} construction, mining for gold, picking fruit, hauling coal, and saw milling. Sport was a passion; he boxed as <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> and also ran foot races and played rugby for Hokitika.|$|E
5|$|Historians have {{traditionally}} dismissed Anne as <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> queen, frivolous and self-indulgent. However, recent reappraisals acknowledge Anne's assertive independence and, in particular, her dynamic significance as a {{patron of the}} arts during the Jacobean age.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be {{the logical}} {{continuation}} of the FreeBSD 4.x series, DragonFly's development has diverged significantly from FreeBSD's, including a new Light Weight Kernel Threads (LWKT) implementation, <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> ports/messaging system, and feature-rich HAMMER file system. Many concepts planned for DragonFly were inspired by the AmigaOS operating system.|$|E

5|$|The Imme R100 was <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> {{motorcycle}} made by Riedel AG from 1948 to 1951. It {{is noted}} for its simple and innovative design with many advanced features. With low cost and technical innovation, the R100 sold well, but reliability problems and low profit margins resulted in warranty costs driving Riedel AG into bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{at the age}} of 20, he {{was sent}} to the frontline, where he took {{photographs}} of life in the trenches with <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> camera (a Goerz Tenax). Most of these photographs were destroyed during the violence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919. Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kert√©sz suffered temporary paralysis of his left arm.|$|E
5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E

In 2008 PHP 5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had been missing from PHP and was added in version 5.3.|$|E
5|$|Relatively light {{horses were}} used by many cultures, {{including}} the Ancient Egyptians, the Mongols, the Arabs, and the Native Americans. Throughout the Ancient Near East, small, light animals were used to pull chariots designed to carry {{no more than two}} passengers, a driver and a warrior. In the European Middle Ages, <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> war horse became known as the rouncey.|$|E
5|$|Stamp {{booklets}} {{were first}} put on sale on 21 August 1931. Booklet construction was <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> cardboard cover stitched on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and interleaving bound in. Until 1956 most booklets had {{half of the}} front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had serial numbers on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the serial numbers ceased.|$|E

5|$|The GLC's {{solution}} entailed adding two concrete piers in {{the middle}} of the river to support the central span and thus transform the bridge's central section into a beam bridge. The bridge's main girder was also strengthened, and <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> replacement deck was laid. The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure to extend the bridge's life by five years while a replacement was being considered; in the GLC's estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30years, but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then.|$|E
5|$|The SS90 was {{an early}} {{prototype}} round used only in the earliest examples of the P90. It used <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> 1.5-g (23grain) {{full metal jacket bullet}} with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). The SS90 was abandoned in 1994 in favor of the heavier and shorter 2.7 mm (0.11in) SS190 projectile.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E

5|$|As an amateur, Cotto {{represented}} Puerto Rico in {{the lightweight}} and light welterweight divisions at various international events, including the 1999 Pan American Games, the 2000 Olympics, and the 1998 Junior World Championships; {{the latter in}} which he won <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated Kelson Pinto for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title to move up in weight. In his first welterweight fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated Carlos Quintana for the vacant WBA title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to Antonio Margarito in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it once before losing it to Manny Pacquiao in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{before the}} {{founding}} of BuroHappold, Edmund Happold, Ian Liddell, Vera Straka, Peter Rice and Michael Dickson established <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> structures research laboratory corresponding to Frei Otto's similar research institute {{at the university of}} Stuttgart. Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory {{led to the development of}} the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study. As the projected main user of the weapon, the Infantry Branch was chosen to oversee the work. They wanted <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> gun that could be moved around by the crew, so any ideas of using a larger caliber {{than that of the}} German gun were discarded. The 37mm was a popular caliber of anti-tank guns in the 1930s; other anti-tank guns of the same caliber included Swedish Bofors gun, Czechoslovakian vz. 34 and vz. 37, Japanese Type 94 and Type 1.|$|E
5|$|Pigeon {{photography}} is an aerial photography technique invented in 1907 by the German apothecary Julius Neubronner, who also used pigeons to deliver medications. A homing pigeon was fitted with an aluminium breast harness to which <b>a</b> <b>lightweight</b> time-delayed miniature camera could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition {{and at the}} 1910 and 1911 Paris Air Shows.|$|E
