500|$|Manchester United manager Ferguson was {{critical}} {{of the performance of}} referee D'Urso: [...] "I felt sorry for the referee today, it doesn't matter how much training you have in any job. It's about temperament, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

Basically my script from Stripped to Kill was re-worked and re-used by Roger Corman and a very bad movie {{was the result of}} that. That’s my opinion <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>think</b> that film was well done. I don’t like that Roger Corman does that. I love Roger, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn’t like that.|$|R
500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E
500|$|In a May 2012 interview, Whedon {{said that}} it was his {{decision}} to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. [...] "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [...] was Avengers Annual #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were {{some of the most important}} texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'" [...] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown. Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release. Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the Angel episode, [...] "A Hole in the World". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, [...] "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," [...] which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.|$|E

2500|$|The album's title, Two Eleven, is a {{reference}} to both Norwood's birthday and the day her idol and mentor, entertainer Whitney Houston, died in 2012. Norwood declared selecting a title a [...] "tough decision". About the title, she stated: [...] "Some of the titles I was working with were Rebirth, Reincarnation, Reinvention, Resurrection [...] I just felt like Two Eleven describes all of that. It’s the day I was born, and each year, I evolve and change with time. It also has {{a whole new meaning}} to it because I gained my angel. My icon is my angel now. It’s all tied in there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it best represents who I am and the responsibilities I have moving on." [...] Dismissing ongoing reproaches, that she was [...] "trying to use the passing of Whitney Houston to sell records," [...] Norwood remarked that the title was nothing but a homage, “I need for everybody to know that, if it wasn’t for Whitney Houston, there would be no me, because she was the possibility for me. She was the vision of my dreams actually coming true, and she meant everything to me.” The official album, photograpphed by Gomillion & Leupold, cover was revealed on August 29, 2012. The deluxe edition cover is entirely identical to the standard edition but is tinged yellow.|$|E

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and we are a much heavier band, both live <b>and</b> on record. <b>I</b> {{have a lot of respect}} for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically <b>and</b> musically. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it's lazy journalism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though the Tea Party {{has had a}} large {{influence}} on the Republican Party, it has attracted major criticism by public figures within the Republican coalition as well. Then-Speaker of the House John Boehner particularly condemned many Tea Party-connected politicians for their behavior during the 2013 U.S. debt ceiling crisis. [...] "I think they're misleading their followers,” Boehner was publicly quoted as saying, [...] "They're pushing our members in places where they don't want to be, <b>and</b> frankly <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that they've lost all credibility."

3000|$|The {{students}} also described {{several aspects of}} Studio STEM that they considered boring, with more responses concerning the presentations being boring than the activities.

Inversely, five additional responses (8 %) suggested that the presentations and activities were boring when the students felt like the material was reviewed too extensively (e.g., “Usually the stuff I already know [is boring] . [...]. [...]. <b>and</b> sometimes <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>think,</b> ‘I know all of this stuff, can we just go on?’”). Finally, several responses (11 %) indicated that some topics and tasks were boring. Most of the responses concerned the presentations (five out of seven responses; e.g., presentations about solar cells, electricity, voltage, current, motors and engines). One student attributed the problem to the instructional methods: “Sometimes it would get a little boring because they just didn’t explain {{it in a very}} exciting way, it was just very dull.” Further, two students said that an activity was boring (working on the computers and creating a device to lift a basket).|$|R

Albarn's singing is mostly in his mid-range, falling out as easily as breath.
