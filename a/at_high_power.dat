5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn {{to develop the}} loudspeaker system of the 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT). Arriving in the marketplace in 1945, it offered better coherence and clarity <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> levels. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the movie theater industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer drivers have large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of these power ceramic capacitors {{can be very}} large. <b>At</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> applications the losses of these capacitors can generate a lot of heat. For this reason some special styles of power ceramic capacitors have pipes for water-cooling.|$|E

25|$|Initial phase: {{the bulb}} is driven with {{controlled}} overload. Because the arc is operated <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power,</b> {{the temperature in}} the capsule rises quickly. The metallic salts vaporize, and the arc is intensified and made spectrally more complete. The resistance between the electrodes also falls; the electronic ballast control gear registers this and automatically switches to continuous operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the Civil Aeronautics Board concluded that a failure in the propeller governor of engine No. 3 caused the propeller to go into reverse during climb-out. The engine was left running <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power,</b> while engine No. 4 was mistakenly feathered. Under such conditions, the aircraft was {{no longer able to}} maintain altitude and descended into the ground.|$|E
25|$|Westinghouse then {{developed}} {{steam turbines}} for maritime propulsion. Large turbines were most efficient at about 3,000rpm, while an efficient propeller operated at about 100rpm. That required reduction gearing, but building reduction gearing that could operate at high rpm and <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> was difficult, since a slight misalignment would shake the power train to pieces. Westinghouse and his engineers devised an automatic alignment system that made turbine power practical for large vessels.|$|E

30|$|Since the NAF {{algorithm}} {{does not}} allocate the transmit power optimally and equally divides the power among multiple data streams instead, the inter-stream interference and the inter-user interference increase significantly <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> transmit <b>power.</b> Hence, the MSE of the NAF algorithm does not improve notably <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> transmit <b>power.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most 3D {{systems will}} {{cut down the}} {{brightness}} of the picture considerably - the light loss can be as high as 88%. Some of this loss may be compensated by running the projector's bulb <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>power</b> or using more powerful bulbs.|$|R
25|$|Unlike some {{cars and}} motorcycles, a Wankel aero-engine will be {{sufficiently}} warm before full power is asked {{of it because}} of the time taken for pre-flight checks. A Wankel aero-engine spends most of its operational time <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> outputs, with little idling. This makes ideal the use of peripheral ports. An advantage is that modular engines with more than two rotors are feasible. If icing of any intake tracts is an issue, there is plenty of waste engine heat available to prevent icing.|$|E
25|$|Others {{speculate}} {{that some of}} these stations {{may be related to the}} smuggling of illegal drugs although this is unlikely and has never shown a case. Unlike government stations, smugglers' stations would need to be lower-powered and irregularly operated, to avoid location by triangulated direction finding. However, numbers stations have transmitted with impunity for decades, so they are generally presumed to be operated or sponsored by governments. Additionally, numbers station transmissions in the international shortwave bands typically transmit <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> levels that might be unavailable to ranches, farms, or plantations in isolated drug-growing regions.|$|E
25|$|By June 1939, Power Jets {{could barely}} {{afford to keep}} the lights on when yet another visit was made by Air Ministry personnel.

One {{of the members of}} the team was the Director of Scientific Research, David Randall Pye, who walked out of the {{demonstration}} utterly convinced of the importance of the project.

25|$|Yet the {{majority}} of World War II engines used superchargers, because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbochargers, which were larger, involved extra piping, and required exotic high-temperature materials in the turbine and pre-turbine section of the exhaust system. The size of the piping alone is a serious issue; American fighters Vought F4U and Republic P-47 used the same engine, but the huge barrel-like fuselage of the latter was, in part, needed to hold the piping {{to and from the}} turbocharger {{in the rear of the}} plane. Turbocharged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines. Pilots must make smooth, slow throttle adjustments to avoid overshooting their target manifold pressure. The fuel/air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of stoichiometric combustion needs to avoid pre-ignition or detonation in the engine when running <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> settings. In systems using a manually operated wastegate, the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbocharger's maximum rpm. The additional systems and piping increase an aircraft engine's size, weight, complexity and cost. A turbocharged aircraft engine costs more to maintain than a comparable normally aspirated engine. The great majority of World War II American heavy bombers used by the USAAF, particularly the Wright R-1820 Cyclone-9 powered B-17 Flying Fortress, and Pratt & Whitney R-1830 Twin Wasp powered Consolidated B-24 Liberator four-engine bombers both used similar models of General Electric-designed turbochargers in service, as did the twin Allison V-1710-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning American heavy fighter during the war years.|$|E

25|$|Designing Stirling engine heat {{exchangers}} is {{a balance between}} high heat transfer with low viscous pumping losses, and low dead space (unswept internal volume).

500|$|Ground {{testing of}} the R {{involved}} the use of three Kestrel engines: one to simulate a headwind or airspeed, one to provide ventilation of the test area, and another to cool the crankcase. Superchargers could be tested on a separate rig that was driven by another Kestrel engine. Eight men were required to run a test cell, led by the [...] "Chief Tester" [...] who had the tasks of logging the figures and directing the other operators. One of these chief testers was Victor Halliwell who later lost his life whilst on board the water speed record contender Miss England II. The conditions in the test cell were particularly unpleasant; deafness and tinnitus lasting up to two days were experienced by test personnel even after plugging their ears with cotton wool. Development time was short and the deafening sound of three Kestrels and an R engine running <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> for 24hours a day took its toll on the local population. The Mayor of Derby stepped in and asked that the people endure the noise {{for the sake of}} British prestige; subsequently testing continued for seven months.|$|E
500|$|The jump is a three-stage process. First, the {{grasshopper}} fully flexes {{the lower}} part of the leg (tibia) against the upper part (femur) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle (the back legs of the grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position). Second, there is a period of co-contraction in which force builds up in the large, pennate extensor tibiae muscle, but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle. The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle, but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed. [...] Co-contraction can last for up to half a second, and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg. The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow (almost isometric), which allows it to develop high force (up to 14N in the desert locust), but because it is slow only low power is needed. The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle, which releases the tibia from the flexed position. The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures, rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle. In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult, or the bow of a bow-and-arrow. Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction, and retrieved from the store <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures.|$|E

2500|$|Before landing, {{the pilot}} {{would open the}} BLC vents as well as {{lower the flaps to}} achieve slow, stable flight. [...] A {{consequence}} of the blown wing was that the engines were required to run <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> for low-speed flight; in order to generate sufficient compressor gas for blowing. [...] Blackburn's solution to this situation was the adoption of a large air brake; this also allowed an overshooting aircraft to pull away more quickly during a failed landing attempt. [...] The nose cone and radar antenna could also be swung around by 180degrees to reduce the length of the aircraft in the carrier hangar. [...] This feature was particularly important due to the small size of the aircraft carriers that the Buccaneer typically operated from.|$|E
2500|$|One {{variation}} on the standard annular combustor is the double annular combustor (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate combustion zones around the radius. The {{difference is that the}} combustor has two combustion zones around the ring; a pilot zone and a main zone. The pilot zone acts like that of a single annular combustor, and is the only zone operating at low power levels. <b>At</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> levels, the main zone is used as well, increasing air and mass flow through the combustor. GE's implementation of this type of combustor focuses on reducing NOx and CO2 emissions[...] Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and [...] "multiple annular" [...] combustors have been proposed and even patented.|$|E
2500|$|As the P-38H, 600 {{of these}} stop-gap Lightnings with an {{improved}} 20mm cannon and a bomb capacity of [...] were produced on one line while the near-definitive P-38J began production {{on the second}} line. [...] The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the turbo-superchargers upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line. This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get. Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and {{would be subject to}} detonation if operated <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>power</b> for extended periods of time. [...] Reliability was not the only issue, either. [...] For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude.
