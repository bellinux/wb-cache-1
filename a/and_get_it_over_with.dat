500|$|The Welcome to the Universe Tour {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jay Cridlin of the St. Petersburg Times praised the {{performance at the}} Jannus Landing, saying that Thirty Seconds to Mars proved to be [...] "a legitimate musical force." [...] Karen Bondowski from Livewire gave a positive review of the concert at the Eagles Ballroom in Milwaukee and complimented songs like [...] "A Beautiful Lie", [...] "Attack", [...] "From Yesterday", [...] "Buddha for Mary" [...] and [...] "R-Evolve". The reviewer {{also said that the}} band [...] "delivered the giant choruses and electrified but deliciously spacey guitars with a genuine fervor." [...] Chad DuPriest from Pegasus News was impressed by the show at Ridglea Theatre in Fort Worth and said [...] "That's what really makes this band stand out. They don't merely go to a concert to perform <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with,</b> they aim to grow their cult and seek recognition – and they do this by putting on a badass concert." [...] He also commented, [...] "Most impressive were the phenomenal lighting effects, able to present the stage as everything from a strobe-lit nightmare to a peaceful realm of lucidity for the light guitar solos." [...] Karah Leigh from the Houstonist gave a positive review of concert at the Verizon Wireless Theater and wrote that the band [...] "completely blew us away", saying that they [...] "did an amazing job." [...] The reviewer however criticized the lack of participation by the audience. Matthew J. Palm of the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of the concert and wrote that [...] " [...] Leto doesn't follow rules.

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E
500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E

5000|$|Wilson was {{to quickly}} record <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> {{as soon as}} {{possible}} so he could focus on recording the bulk of Smile for the January, 1967 release that he had promised Capitol Records. However, Smile was abandoned, and the track lay dormant for several months. The song was eventually released together with [...] "Cabinessence" [...] on their 1969 album 20/20, albeit with some added vocal overdubs. The main vocals were recorded in late 1966 with the additional vocals being recorded at Capitol Records Studios two years later.|$|E

5000|$|Maybe John was right. Maybe the Beatles were crap.

One decision concerned the release of the Let It Be documentary, a necessity in order to fulfil the Beatles' contractual obligations to film company United Artists.|$|E
50|$|Later, Logan went to {{the airport}} where Bruce was, got on the same plane, and sat next to him. Logan put a collar made by Forge on Bruce, telling {{him that if he}} turns into Hulk while the collar is on him, he will choke to death. Bruce asks why Logan simply won't just kill him <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with,</b> and Logan says that he didn't want to kill Bruce, he wanted to kill the Hulk. Bruce said that he did not deserve the {{treatment}} and that he was a good person, but Logan replied that he is a bad person and that it is irrelevant what either person deserves.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} it later, Betts was {{philosophical}} about the experience: It {{was one of those}} things where it was a job you can't say no to, even though I was nine months pregnant. ... It's weird, all the criticism and all the tough calls at Bazaar, and getting fired ultimately, those were all hard things to experience, but with hindsight, which is always 20/20, they were great experiences. I don't regret any of it at all. It was an amazing opportunity to learn how to edit a magazine in two years, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> There are a lot of lessons there, but the thing I always come back to is, if you're doing something you really believe in, you never regret anything you do.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} begun to talk business, Godfrey," [...] replied his father in an acid manner, [...] "we may as well go into things <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> You have, I presume, made up your mind {{to go into the}} Church in {{accordance}} with my wish?" ...|$|R

5000|$|On April 4, Twila Busby's {{daughter}} Lisa and Busby's uncle Dave Brito [...] "broke {{years of}} silence" [...] and gave {{an interview to}} News Channel 10 in Amarillo. Lisa {{was the only one}} in her family to survive the murders and chose [...] "to stay at her aunt and uncles' place - keeping away from home because she was scared her mom's boyfriend Skinner might turn violent after drinking that night at a New Year's Eve party." [...] Lisa Busby also appeared to advocate for Skinner's execution. [...] "We're suffering. We have no closure. We have no peace because he's still alive," [...] she said. Lisa finished her interview by agreeing that the testing needed to be done, saying [...] "I mean test the DNA <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> ...

5000|$|If one of {{the players}} were to win a single game, making the score 1-away, 2-away Crawford, the {{trailing}} player's odds of winning the match would now be 30% (explanation below). Therefore, the take threshold for both players is 30% or greater chance of winning the game, regardless of gammons. Additionally, it is important to double while the opponent can still take; should a player's advantage on the board exceed 70% winning chances he will have [...] "lost his market", allowing his opponent to drop the double and continue the match at 30% winning odds. It is an error not to double if there is any possibility of losing one's market; however it is not an error to double even if no market losing possibility exists. For practical purposes then, the simplest strategy is to double on the first move <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{mission is}} {{completed}} successfully {{with only one}} death and one man wounded of the British soldiers. The patrol ambushes a German detachment, capturing Oberst Lutze, who Brandt knows {{was responsible for the}} secret information. Possibly in the hope of getting rid of Leith, Brandt leaves him alone with two seriously wounded men, one British, one German. Leith decides to put them out of their pain. He shoots the German, who pleads for his life. The Briton encourages Leith to act quickly, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> Leith puts his pistol to the soldier’s head and fires, but there are no bullets left. Rather than reloading, Leith picks the man up, and sets out to carry him to safety. The ironic use of music here, a heroic march, is unusually powerful. The man cries out in agony and curses Leith’s failure, but dies before Leith puts him down again. Leith, whose Arab friend has joined him, then catches up {{with the rest of the}} unit.|$|E
6000|$|Carl {{felt sorry}} for him. [...] "Poor man 's fussed. Ought to be! I'd be, too, if I tried to stop a ten-inch gun like Frazer.... He's singing hard.... Announcements, now....

6000|$|Babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. He {{sent the}} frightened Tinka {{out of the}} room. He said gaily to his wife, [...] "Well, old thing, the doc thinks maybe we better have a little {{operation}} <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> Just take a few minutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you'll be all right in a jiffy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bed-rock!" [...] he repeated, and {{remained}} gazing at Neale fixedly. Then {{he turned to}} Lodge. [...] "Do you remember that wild red-head cowboy--Neale's friend--when he said, 'I reckon thet's aboot all?'... I'll never forget him... Lodge, say we have Lee and his friend Senator Dunn come in, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over.</b> An' thet'll be aboot all!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Logan goes to {{the airport}} where Bruce is, gets on the same plane, and sits next to him.

Bruce asks why Logan simply won't just kill him <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with,</b> and Logan says that he doesn't want to kill Bruce, he wants to kill the Hulk. Bruce says that he won't change, and then jumps out of the {{airplane}} emergency exit in mid-flight. Logan jumps out after him screaming at him to turn into the Hulk or the fall will kill him. Bruce says that he will only change if Logan cuts off the collar, or else Logan {{will have to deal with}} the fact that he simply let [...] "Bruce" [...] and not the [...] "Hulk" [...] fall to his death. Logan, not wanting to be responsible for Bruce's death breaks the collar. Bruce changes to Hulk, holds Logan, and lands on his feet with no harm to either of them.|$|E
5000|$|Child discipline. Most {{families}} {{gave their}} children [...] "whippings". In The Great Brain Reforms, Parley Benson {{says that his}} pa [...] "horsewhipped" [...] him for letting Tom cheat {{him out of his}} repeating air rifle. The better-educated, more progressive Fitzgeralds are a notable exception with their use of the silent treatment. This means that Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald will not talk to or acknowledge those who are punished. It often lasted from a range of one day to one week depending on the infraction, but could be longer. One chapter dealt with Frankie misbehaving and being punished by the silent treatment, and given his young age and unfamiliarity with such a punishment, reacts inappropriately. J.D. frequently describes the silent treatment as worse than a whipping because of the emotional impact of being ignored by his parents, and at times says that he wishes his parents would just give them a whipping <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with.</b> One chapter dealt with Frankie being subject to the silent treatment and misconstruing it as being disinherited from the Fitzgeralds, causing him to run away from home. In later books as Tom and J.D. age, Papa admits the silent treatment is becoming outmoded, and now resorts to extra chores or revocation of allowances as punishments.|$|E
5000|$|However, it {{does not}} take long for Camoorians to realize that Domenico is not, in fact, related to any of the marshals of the city or the Grand Marshall thanks to Ciccio, so the word about him gets out, and he is soon dragged against his will to meet Marshall Federico Cezar, and his violent second-in-command, Miccinio. Federico {{questions}} Domenico about the money, wondering if Domenico killed someone and stole the money, but Domenico is adamant that this money was a gift from his father. Federico and Miccinio mock Domenico about his father, stating that if he were here, he would protect Domenico from them, and start pushing him around, saying [...] "Father does not exist". Frustrated, Domenico yells at his tormentors to kill him <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with,</b> and while Federico is considering it, Miccinio tells him {{that it would be better}} to keep Domenico as a [...] "pet" [...] and make him sit on a shelf and make him pay for all of Marshall's women, food and wine instead of robbing him outright. Federico likes the idea, and although Domenico at first refuses to obey the Marshall's commands, Miccinio scares him into doing it. Domenico is forced to participate in Marshall's [...] "game" [...] because Miccinio scares him more than death itself, considering the rumors that he has heard about the man which imply that Miccinio is a sadist and a torturer and delights in killing the enemies of his city.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} only a {{straight}} man can buck a straight man like him, and the man's never hit the Solomons {{that could do}} it. Men {{like you and me}} can't buck him.

5000|$|On December 8, 2010, Clark officially {{announced}} her intent {{to seek the}} leadership of the BC Liberal Party. While Clark had long been touted as a potential successor to BC Premier Gordon Campbell, she often claimed she had no further interest in a political career. Public polling conducted prior to and after the announcement of her candidacy showed that Clark was the frontrunner to succeed Campbell as leader of the BC Liberals and premier. Clark launched her leadership bid saying she wanted a “family-first agenda”. During the campaign she tried to cast herself as an outsider from the current caucus, and as the only candidate who could provide the change voters were looking for. Clark's policy proposals included observing a provincial Family Day in February, establishing an Office of the Municipal Auditor General to monitor local government taxation, and to provide a more open government by holding 12 town hall meetings a year to hear from residents. Regarding the controversial Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), she campaigned early on to cancel the referendum scheduled for September 2011. She suggested a free vote in the legislature by MLAs, believing the HST referendum has little chance of success. [...] "Let our MLAs do their jobs and let our MLAs vote down the HST. Do it by March 31 <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>with</b> and get on with life in B.C.", Clark told a crowd of about 40 in Pitt Meadows. However, she eventually decided to continue with the planned referendum.|$|E
