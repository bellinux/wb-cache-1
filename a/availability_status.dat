50|$|In a {{disaster}} or emergency situation, {{there is a}} need for hospitals to be able to communicate with each other, and with other members of the emergency response community. The ability to exchange data in regard to hospitals’ bed <b>availability,</b> <b>status,</b> services, and capacity enables both hospitals and other emergency agencies to respond to emergencies and disaster situations with greater efficiency and speed. In particular, it will allow emergency dispatchers and managers to make sound logistics decisions - where to route victims, which hospitals have the ability to provide the needed service. Many hospitals have expressed the need for, and indeed are currently using, commercial or self-developed information technology that allows them to publish this information to other hospitals in a region, as well as EOCs, 9-1-1 centers, and EMS responders via a Web-based tool. Systems that are available today do not record or present data in a standardized format, creating a serious barrier to data sharing between hospitals and emergency response groups. Without data standards, parties of various kinds are unable to view data from hospitals in a state or region that use a different system - unless a specialized interface is developed. Alternatively, such officials must get special passwords and toggle between web pages to get a full picture. Other local emergency responders are unable to get the data imported into the emergency IT tools they use (e.g. a 9-1-1 computer-aided dispatch system or an EOC consequence information management system). They too must get a pass word and go to the appropriate web page. This is very inefficient. A uniform data standard will allow different applications and systems to communicate seamlessly.|$|E

40|$|Background: Childhood {{obesity is}} a strong {{predictor}} of adult obesity incidence and can increase risk factors for getting chronic diseases. The causes of obesity are multifactor, determined by genetic and food environment changes. Risk factors {{believed to be the}} cause of obesity are home food <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> and maternal obesity. Objective: To analyze the risk of home food <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> and maternal obesity to obesity in preschool children aged 3 - 5 years.   Method: This study was a matched case-control study.  The case of this study was obese preschool children (Z-score WHZ > 2 SD) and control of this study was non-obese preschool children (Z-score WHZ - 2 ≤ SD ≤ 2).  Control group was taken by an age and gender matching with the case group. Based on the nutritional status screening result of 53 early childhood education (ECD) schools on 13 sub-districts in Kota Yogyakarta, there were 101 obese children and 101 non-obese children. Those schools were chosen by cluster sampling method and PPS (Probability Proportional to Size). Besides, information about home food <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> and maternal obesity was collected using questionnaire.  The data were analyzed using McNemar test and conditional logistic regression.   Results: Home food <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> (OR = 1. 85; p= 0. 03; 95 % CI= 1. 08 - 3. 16) and maternal obesity (OR= 2. 5; p= 0. 003; 95 % CI= 1. 37 - 4. 55) were the most dominant risk factor related to the incidence of obesity in preschool children aged 3 - 5 years. Conclusion: Home food <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> and maternal obesity significantly increase the risk for getting obese in preschool children aged 3 - 5 years...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} {{availability}} management {{has been extensively}} investigated in related research. However, thus far the approach to this subject was primarily motivated {{by the need to}} protect an interruptee from an unwanted interruption. In this approach, <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> was assumed to be static: either the interruptee was interactive, thus willing to accept an interruption or interpassive, thus prone to reject it. In this research we would like to propose a different assumption: that <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> has a dynamic rather than a static nature and that both communicators conjointly influence that status. To test that assumption, we explored the nature of availability and factors that are likely to influence it through a series of empirical investigations. These studies have shown that availability state is likely to be influenced by factors such as: social proximity, nature of the communication subject and anticipated interruption duration. We have also observed that while social proximity was shown to be a crucial factor for face-to-face communications, it appeared to have little impact on the <b>availability</b> <b>status</b> in email communications...|$|E
