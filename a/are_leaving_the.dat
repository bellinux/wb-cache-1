5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 {{malnourished}} or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the abundance of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really malnourished washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E

5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|With the {{war with}} the Cartel intensifying, Asuka and Maria learn of Claude's history with Catalina and order him to attack many Cartel operations. Eventually, his {{exploits}} {{attract the attention of}} Catalina. As a result, the Cartel kidnap Maria, murder Asuka and Miguel, and demand Claude to pay a $500,000 ransom in exchange for Maria's release. When Claude confronts Catalina, she attempts to have him killed, but he escapes. In the resulting firefight, Catalina attempts to flee in a helicopter and makes a final attempt on Claude's life. After killing the remaining Cartel members and rescuing Maria, Claude shoots down the helicopter, effectively killing Catalina. As they <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> scene, Maria complains to Claude about the kidnapping, particularly the state of her appearance. During the credits, a gunshot is heard, and Maria's voice is silenced.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three <b>are</b> <b>leaving,</b> <b>the</b> vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E

25|$|Transverse rumble strips (TRS) {{may be used}} to warn drivers: of {{the need}} to stop (e.g. intersections, toll plazas); the need to slow down; the need to change lanes; of a change in roadway alignment; that they <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> {{traveled}} way; upcoming construction zones; wildlife crossings; and other potentially unexpected conditions.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder and {{centerline}} rumble strips {{are used}} to reduce lane departure crashes. Centerline rumble strips are used on undivided highways to reduce cross-over incidents and resultant head-on collisions. Shoulder rumble strips are used primarily to reduce run-off-road collisions. They alert distracted or drowsy drivers that they <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> roadway or crossing the centerline of the road. In this application, they are narrower {{and outside of the}} wheelpaths.|$|E
25|$|In {{the post-war}} period Subotica has {{gradually}} modernised itself. During the Yugoslav and Kosovo {{wars of the}} 1990s, {{a considerable number of}} Serb refugees came to the city from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, whilst many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as local Serbs, left the country because of economical stagnation. However, unlike in some other places of Serbia, number of Serbs who are moving to Subotica is larger than the number of those who <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

The shelter had planned on moving from that location in 2009 when their lease expired, but stated that they would <b>be</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> location because of the media scrutiny of Kink.com's presence.|$|R
25|$|During one {{of these}} attempts, they {{end up on the}} planet Viltvodle VI. Zaphod decides to visit Humma Kavula, his {{opponent}} from the election. Upon learning of Zaphod's plan, Kavula announces that he has the coordinates to Magrathea. He takes one of Zaphod's two heads hostage and demands they bring him the Point-of-View gun created by Deep Thought, which allows the target to understand the shooter's point of view. As they <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> planet, Trillian is captured by Vogons. The others travel to rescue her from the Vogon home world bureaucracy, facing long lines and frustrating form processing. Trillian learns of the Earth's destruction, and is outraged to learn that Zaphod signed the authorisation for the destruction of Earth thinking it was a request for an autograph.|$|E
25|$|Artificial levees block spring {{flood water}} {{that would bring}} fresh water and {{sediment}} to marshes. Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow saline water to move inland. Canals dug for {{the oil and gas}} industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a land mass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear. And as the communities disappear, more and more people <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> region. Since the coastal wetlands support an economically important coastal fishery, the loss of wetlands is adversely affecting this industry.|$|E
25|$|During {{emergencies}} where {{evacuation of}} a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, {{in which all}} lanes of a road lead away from a danger zone regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may {{also be used to}} ease traffic congestion during rush hour or {{at the end of a}} sports event (where a large number of cars <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three outbound to a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect São Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The reversibility of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.|$|E

500|$|As {{mayor of}} Newark, New Jersey, he [...] "drew {{criticism}} from liberal allies for embracing charter schools and voucher programs advocated by libertarians." [...] "He also championed “enterprise zones,” a free-market approach to solving urban blight credited {{to the late}} Jack Kemp, a hard-core supply-sider and occasional Republican presidential contender who helped raise money for Booker’s first mayoral campaign." [...] Besides social media advances, Booker {{wants to see the}} rest of the tech sector reach its fullest potential, and to do that, he thinks the U.S. government needs to ease up on regulations. “We’re not moving at the speed of innovation due to regulations,” he said, adding that because of this, key industries <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to work on projects in other countries where the rules aren’t as strict. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration has hindered drone innovation to the point where drone companies <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to test and build in Europe. “We’re being left behind on everything from next-generation nuclear energy to driverless cars and biologics,” Booker said, “and we cannot get left behind.” He supports long-term deficit reduction efforts to ensure economic prosperity, Cap and Trade taxation to combat climate change, and increased funding for education. He supports ending the War on Drugs. Daniel J. Mitchell of the Cato Institute identities Booker as having libertarian views in opposition to the War on Drugs. Booker supports abortion rights and affirmative action.|$|E
500|$|One {{argument}} against the ACA is that the insurers <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> marketplaces, as they cannot profitably cover the available pool of customers, which contains too many unhealthy participants relative to healthy participants. A scenario where prices rise, due to an unfavorable mix of customers from the insurer's perspective, resulting in fewer customers and fewer insurers in the marketplace, further raising prices, {{has been called a}} [...] "death spiral." [...] During 2017, the median number of insurers offering plans on the ACA exchanges in each state was 3.0, meaning half the states had more and half had fewer insurers. There were five states with one insurer in 2017; 13 states with two; 11 states with three; and the remainder had four insurers or more. Wisconsin had the most, with 15 insurers in the marketplace. The median number of insurers was 4.0 in 2016, 5.0 in 2015, and 4.0 in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Rumble Strips: The KY 9 {{corridor}} has an [...] "unusually {{large percentage}} of vehicle collisions with guardrails." [...] Adding rumble strips would reduce these types of crashes by alerting the inattentive driver that they <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> roadway. [...] "This also can potentially reduce the occurrence of drivers using the shoulders to pass vehicles because the audible and physical vibration would cause driver discomfort." [...] The transportation cabinet is also [...] "conducting a field evaluation of center-line rumble strips." [...] During rainy conditions, the centerlines on the roadway would be further enhanced (visibility-wise) by {{the angle of the}} reflective painting on the strips.|$|E

2500|$|Church tax (Kirchensteuer) is {{compulsory}} in Germany {{for those}} confessing {{members of a}} particular religious group. It is deducted at the PAYE level.

2500|$|While {{there is}} no {{definite}} proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back {{at least as far}} as 220 AD or possibly earlier. [...] The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid 19th century. The pigeon fanciers of Belgium were so taken with the hobby that they began to develop pigeons specially cultivated for fast flight and long endurance called Voyageurs. From Belgium the modern version of the sport and the Voyageurs which the Flemish fanciers developed spread to most parts of the world. Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising cost of living, ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is also a reason why some people <b>are</b> <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> sport ...|$|E
