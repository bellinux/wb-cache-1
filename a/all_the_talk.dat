25|$|For the {{remainder}} of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale. Although Parker publicly denied these claims, {{he had been in}} talks with Peter Grant, manager of Led Zeppelin, about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley. As with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> about Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.|$|E
25|$|Playing on {{the squad}} {{led by the}} 26-year-old superstar Kaká in {{addition}} to several other world-class players {{at or near the}} peak of their careers – 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo – as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico. Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start. Going into Beckham's home debut versus Fiorentina a week later, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> was around Kaká being the target of a reported £100million transfer bid by Manchester City. Beckham turned in another understated performance {{on the right side of}} midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} these games has been {{attributed}} to their innovative gaming experience rather than audiovisual effects. Papers published by the Columbia Business School indicate both American and Japanese children prefer the actual gameplay of a game over special audio or visual effects. In Pokémon games, the lack of these artificial effects has actually been said to promote the child's imagination and creativity. [...] "With <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> of game engines and texture mapping and so on, there is something refreshing about this superlative gameplay which makes you ignore the cutesy 8-bit graphics" [...] commented The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We {{made our}} own scandal {{just by being}} ourselves. Maybe {{it was that he}} knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> about the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh {{said that}} the Maoist-Naxalites had no faith {{whatsoever}} in the political system, democracy, electoral politics and constitutional values and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> of tribal welfare for them is a sham and is an excuse, and an alibi for perpetrating the violent overthrow of a democratic system.

2500|$|Like a lot {{of other}} people, I first became aware that a {{promising}} young player named David Campese had arrived on the scene when he appeared in a curtain-raiser to a Test against [...] at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982. Campese was playing for the Australian under 21s against the New Zealand under 21s. I was a reserve that day for the Test, so I was in the dressing-room and did not watch the curtain-raiser myself, but I soon came to hear about it.

[...] "I am convinced that the Lord has decided to give me some extra time to do some things in this, my last command, which might better insure a safer world. That is the gist of my prayers.

2500|$|Most {{negative}} reviews {{came from}} American film critics. Among the negative reviews, Janet Maslin from The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Lynch's taste for brain-dead grotesque {{has lost its}} novelty". Fellow Times film critic Vincent Canby concurred, [...] "It's not the worst movie ever made; {{it just seems to}} be". In his review for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy said, [...] "Laura Palmer, after <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk,</b> is not a very interesting or compelling character and long before the climax has become a tiresome teenager". USA Today gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it, [...] "a morbidly joyless affair". Rolling Stone magazine's Peter Travers wrote, [...] "though the movie ups the TV ante on nudity, language and violence, Lynch's control falters. But if inspiration is lacking, talent is not. Count Lynch down but never out". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley described the film as a [...] "perversely moving, profoundly self-indulgent prequel".|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we want to know where we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has gotten to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E
