500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E

500|$|In combat mode, {{the screen}} changes to a {{top-down}} mode with dimetric projection, where the player decides what actions the characters will take in each round. These actions are taken immediately, rather than after all commands {{have been issued}} as is standard in some RPGs. Optionally, the player can let the computer choose character moves for each round. Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them. If a character's hit points (HP) fall below zero, {{he or she must}} be bandaged by another character or the character will die. The game contains random encounters, and game reviewers for Dragon magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper AD game manuals.

500|$|For the U.S. and its allies, {{the victory}} in the Tenaru battle was psychologically {{significant}} in that Allied soldiers, {{after a series of}} defeats by Japanese Army units throughout the Pacific and east Asia, now knew that they could defeat the Imperial Armies in a land battle. [...] The battle also set another precedent that would continue throughout the war in the Pacific, which was the reluctance of defeated Japanese soldiers to surrender and their efforts to continue killing Allied soldiers, even as the Japanese soldiers lay dying on the battlefield. On this subject Vandegrift remarked, [...] "I have never heard or read of this kind of fighting. These people refuse to surrender. The wounded wait until men come up to examine them...and blow themselves and the other fellow to pieces with a hand grenade." [...] Robert Leckie, a Guadalcanal veteran, recalls the aftermath of the battle in his book Helmet For My Pillow, [...] "Our regiment had killed something like nine hundred of them. Most lay in clusters or heaps before the gun pits commanding sandspit, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not died singly but in groups.

500|$|Fielding prided himself {{upon his}} fairness—no {{matter what the}} social {{standing}} of the witness—he subjected Hall to repeated questioning and, frustrated at her contradictory answers, threatened her with imprisonment. [...] This had the desired effect because on 14February Hall stated that John Squires (son of Mary) and another man had brought Canning to Wells's house early {{on the morning of}} 2January. [...] There, before the two kidnappers, Lucy Squires and Hall, the old gypsy had assaulted Canning and forced her upstairs, where she remained until her escape. [...] Hall said that Fortune Natus and his wife Judith had been at the house for some weeks but were moved into the loft to make it appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> stayed there throughout January. [...] Hall's and Canning's evidence now tallied almost perfectly, and Fielding turned to Judith Natus. [...] Although she corroborated Hall's claim {{that she and her husband}} had slept in Wells's loft throughout January, Fielding was unconvinced and urged her to reconsider her statement. [...] Although not charged with any crime, Hall meanwhile was committed to the Gatehouse Prison in Westminster, her stay paid for by the Canningites. [...] Fielding left London for a short while before returning to interview Squires, Wells and the others. [...] Wells and Squires denied any knowledge of Canning or her travails, and strongly protested their innocence. This had little credence, due to the long-standing habit of the accused of breaking the law and lying about it.|$|E
