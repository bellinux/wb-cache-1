40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue for <b>a</b> non-referential <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> some uses of indexicals {{embedded}} under epistemic modals. The so-called descriptive uses of indexicals come in several types {{and it is}} argued that those embedded within the scope of modal operators do not require non-referential interpretation, provided the modality is interpreted as epistemic. I endeavor to show that even if we allow <b>an</b> epistemic <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> modalities, the resulting interpretation will still be inadequate as long as we retain <b>a</b> referential <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> indexicals. I then propose an analysis of descriptive indexicals that combines <b>an</b> epistemic <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> modality with <b>a</b> non-referential <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> indexicals...|$|R

5|$|Many popular modern {{accounts}} of the war claim {{that there was a}} factional split in the escaped slaves between those under Spartacus, who wished to escape over the Alps to freedom, and those under Crixus, who wished to stay in southern Italy to continue raiding and plundering. This appears to be <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussing}} Supreme Court precedent, Heins {{recounts the}} jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they {{felt that it was}} the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E
5|$|Bohr's {{evidence}} {{came from}} <b>an</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> {{a letter he}} received from a Soviet friend and scientist in Russia, which he showed to the British security services. He reasoned that the longer the United States and Britain hid their nuclear advancements, Russia would feel increasingly threatened and more inclined to speed up their effort to produce an atomic bomb of their own. With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work. At the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944, Roosevelt sided with Churchill, deciding {{that it would be}} upon the nation's best interest to keep the atomic bomb project a secret. Moreover, they decided Bohr was potentially dangerous and specific security measures must be made in order to prevent him from leaking information {{to the rest of the}} world, Russia in particular.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> {{the story}} about the Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by {{literary}} theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
