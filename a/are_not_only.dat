5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Russia. These <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed the tree line. In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E

5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship and in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E

5|$|Canis dirus {{lived in}} the late Pleistocene to the early Holocene (125,000–10,000 years before present or YBP) in North and South America (although no members of Canis survive in the latter continent).

However, there are disputed specimens of C.dirus that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of C.dirus discovered at four sites in the Hay Springs area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish {{a description of the}}m. Nowak later referred to this material as C.armbrusteri; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both C.armbrusteri and C.dirus, he referred to them only as C.dirus. These Nebraskan fossil specimens may represent the earliest record of C.dirus.|$|E

5|$|Wilhelm Röntgen {{discovered}} X-rays in 1895, just as {{the studies}} of crystal symmetry were being concluded. Physicists were initially uncertain {{of the nature of}} X-rays, but soon suspected (correctly) that they were waves of electromagnetic radiation, in other words, another form of light. At that time, the wave model of light—specifically, the Maxwell theory of electromagnetic radiation—was well accepted among scientists, and experiments by Charles Glover Barkla showed that X-rays exhibited phenomena associated with electromagnetic waves, including transverse polarization and spectral lines akin to those observed in the visible wavelengths. Single-slit experiments in the laboratory of Arnold Sommerfeld suggested that X-rays had a wavelength of about 1 angstrom. However, X-rays are composed of photons, and thus <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> waves of electromagnetic radiation but also exhibit particle-like properties. Albert Einstein introduced the photon concept in 1905, but it was not broadly accepted until 1922, when Arthur Compton confirmed it by the scattering of X-rays from electrons. Therefore, these particle-like properties of X-rays, such as their ionization of gases, caused William Henry Bragg to argue in 1907 that X-rays were not electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, Bragg's view was not broadly accepted and the observation of X-ray diffraction by Max von Laue in 1912 confirmed for most scientists that X-rays were a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
