5|$|Morse died in 1940, after 34 {{years as}} director, and several {{years went by}} without a strong local leadership. To ensure a sounder footing for the future, Coonley merged Avery Coonley with the National College of Education (NCE, {{formerly}} the Chicago Kindergarten College and now National-Louis University) in Evanston, Illinois, in 1943. The two institutions had close ties dating back to Morse's Kindergarten College days, and the arrangement {{took advantage of the}} NCE's financial and teaching resources while Avery Coonley provided a living laboratory for teacher training and educational research. Under NCE management, ACS continued to offer <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>that</b> emphasized practical learning, outdoor education—including farming—and hands-on activities like automobile repair. German and French were added in 1949, with students beginning conversational French in first grade.|$|E

5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>that</b> {{required more}} scientific study than practically any undergraduate {{institution of the}} era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} how to develop {{curriculum}} for construction management programs has been debated for several years by university faculty. Construction management is a recognized discipline that needs to maintain a strong identity positioned between architecture and engineering.

Therefore, construction management education needs <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> model <b>that</b> will help university faculty to achieve and maintain relevant construction management programs. This paper describes <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> model <b>that</b> integrates <b>curriculum</b> development, instructional design, and program evaluation...|$|R

25|$|Standardized {{tests have}} caused the quality and depth of the {{educational}} curriculum to diminish (Rooks, Noliwe, and Noliwe Rooks). Instead of teachers developing <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>that</b> addresses {{the needs of the}} actual students in their classrooms, they end up using the required material which they did not take any part in creating. The required material often contains pacing guidelines which regulate when substance should be taught and scripted lessons which often limits the teacher’s abilities to make relevant decisions in a classroom.|$|E

25|$|Israeli {{schools are}} divided into four {{different}} tracks: state-secular (Mamlachti), state-religious (Mamlachti dati), independent religious (חרדי Haredi or חינוך עצמאי Ḥinuch Atzmai), and Arab. There are also private schools which reflect the philosophies of specific groups of parents (Democratic Schools), or {{that are based on}} the curriculum of a foreign country (e.g., The American International School in Israel). The majority of Israeli children attend state schools. State-religious schools, catering to youngsters from the Orthodox sector (mainly Religious Zionist/Modern Orthodox), offer intensive Jewish studies programs, and emphasize tradition and observance. The Chinuch Atzmai schools focus almost entirely on Torah study and offer very little in terms of secular subjects. Schools in the Arab sector teach in Arabic, and offer <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>that</b> emphasizes Arab history, religion, and culture.|$|E
25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers.

It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed <b>a</b> <b>curriculum</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used in}} schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E
