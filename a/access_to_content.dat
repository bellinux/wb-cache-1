5|$|In June 2011, Rowling {{launched}} a new website announcing an upcoming project called Pottermore, where all future Harry Potter projects, and all electronic downloads, would be concentrated. Pottermore opened {{to the general public}} on 14 April 2012. Pottermore allows users to be sorted, be chosen by their wand and play various minigames. The main purpose of the website was to allow the user to journey though the story with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>content</b> not revealed by J.K. Rowling previously, with over 18,000 words of information on characters, places and objects in the Harry Potter universe. In September 2015, the website {{launched a}} newly designed site containing news, features and articles plus previously unreleased writing by Rowling and removed some features including the interactive Moment illustrations, House Cup and Sorting ceremony. A newly designed Sorting Ceremony was subsequently launched on 28 January 2016 in which users could reclaim their old house or be re-sorted.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and their scores are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in the same fashion as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>content.</b> In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E

25|$|During development, Kojima Productions and Konami {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} {{their decision to}} include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>content</b> in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players {{who may not have}} the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions. Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall, which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a paywall.|$|E

25|$|Its {{primary goal}} {{continues}} to be to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries to have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>content,</b> media and computer-programming environments. At {{the time that the}} program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so it was infeasible to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support.|$|E
25|$|Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy-handed {{implementation}} of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA). Under OCILLA, a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>content</b> {{as soon as they}} receive an official notice of infringement, to maintain protection from liability. After having one of his own pictures taken down following an incorrect DMCA claim, British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States – or they were but the person filing the notice of infringement was not – Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately. Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright, Flickr did not, according to Gorman, replace the deleted content. He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a counter-notice. Shortly afterward, Flickr changed its policy.|$|E

[...] Free subscribers may also purchase paid points to participate in micro-transactions and purchase in-game items that do not directly impact combat related gameplay.|$|E
