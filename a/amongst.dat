5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) <b>amongst</b> women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease <b>amongst</b> them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease <b>amongst</b> those with diabetes and <b>amongst</b> smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
