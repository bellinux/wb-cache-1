Correlation between photos <b>and</b> <b>videos</b> comes from similar content {{captured in the}} same temporal order. We transform photos <b>and</b> <b>videos</b> into sequences of visual word histograms, and adopt approximate sequence matching to find correlation. To summarize photos <b>and</b> <b>videos,</b> we propose that the characteristics of correlated photos can be utilized in selecting important video segments into <b>video</b> summaries, <b>and</b> on the other hand, the characteristics of correlated video segments can be utilized in selecting important photos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed summarization methods well {{take advantage of the}} correlation...|$|R
