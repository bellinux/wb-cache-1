Theowner promised he would get all {{necessary}} permits for live music. Itnever happened. Jack stopped paying rent and one night they arrived to find <b>alock</b> on the door. Together with Besser and {{a large group of}} jazz enthusiasts, theybroke the lock and put Count Basie on the record player. One or two weeks later, once again they were locked out. Finally, one night, Jack Hand and Besserdecided to try it on their own. The owner was ready for them and had them beatenup by an off duty policeman and the waiters. Besser was beaten across the backand legs and Jack had his jaw broken in three places.|$|E
40|$|Lock Modes Replicas of {{an object}} o i are locked in a mode (op i) before op i is computed. If the replicas are already locked by modes {{conflicting}} with (op i), op i blocks. The larger number of modes conflict with (op i), the longer op i blocks. A lock mode m 1 is more restricted than m 2 iff C i (m 1) ' C i (m 2) 6). [Example 1] Let rlock and wlock be lock modes for read and write, respectively, in a file object f. C f (rlock) = fwlockg and C f (wlock) = fwlock, rlockg. Since C f (rlock) ` C f (wlock), wlock is more restricted than rlock. 2 [Example 2] A bank object B supports methods Deposit, W ithdraw, Check, and Audit. Let Dlock, W lock, Clock, and <b>Alock</b> show the lock modes (Deposit), (Withdraw), (Check), and (Audit), respectively. Dlock and W lock are compatible. The mode Clock conflicts with the modes Dlock and W lock. Audit derives data on the accounts and stores them in the object B. Hence, <b>Alock</b> conflicts with Dlock and W lock but is compatible with Clock. [...] ...|$|E
