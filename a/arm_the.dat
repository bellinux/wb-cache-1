5|$|The most {{important}} groups that lacked {{representation in the}} Underground State included the communist (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military <b>arm,</b> <b>the</b> Gwardia Ludowa), and the far right (Group Szaniec and its military <b>arm,</b> <b>the</b> Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) saw themselves {{in opposition to the}} Underground State. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a legitimate opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the PKWN Soviet puppet government.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} the wider arm is {{referred}} to as the Northwest Arm, while the eastern arm is known as the Northeast <b>Arm.</b> <b>The</b> two arms connect just below Church Point, southeast of where West River meets the Northwest <b>Arm.</b> <b>The</b> harbour continues southeast-ward, then southward toward the Atlantic Ocean. The Northwest Arm extends northwest until it meets the mouth of West River at the West River Falls. The Northeast Arm extends north, then curves northeast under the East River Bridge, until it meets the mouth of the East River. There is a very small island in the arm, named Hen Island. Moorings were installed in the arm in Spring 2017.|$|E

5|$|Convair's {{proposal}} {{gained an}} order for two prototypes in late 1951. Twelve production aircraft were ordered before a prototype had even flown. No armament was ever fitted to any Sea Dart built, but {{the plan was to}} <b>arm</b> <b>the</b> production aircraft with four 20mm Colt Mk12 cannon and a battery of folding-fin unguided rockets. Four of this order were redesignated as service test vehicles, and an additional eight production aircraft were soon ordered as well.|$|E

5|$|The 20-year-old {{king was}} inexperienced and {{considered}} ill-served amidst {{what has been}} called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in Scania to <b>arm</b> <b>the</b> Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Mary Rose began in 1510 in Portsmouth and she was launched in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with rigging and decking, and supplied with armaments.

5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to <b>arm</b> <b>the</b> most {{important}} place.

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook and Edrich fell early, leaving England at 39/2. This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left <b>arm.</b> <b>The</b> batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd.

5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the <b>arm.</b> <b>The</b> time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
