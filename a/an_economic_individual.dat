40|$|The article {{offers a}} {{theoretical}} and methodological assessment of modern institutional and technological shifts {{and changes in}} the context of their impact on the social status of <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>individual</b> and its ability to effectively appropriate results of socio-economic development under conditions of the post-industrial society and globalisation. The article describes the content of socialisation of economy in the post-industrial society as a process of removal of social and institutional gaps, which arise due to a self-sufficient technological development, and demonstrates the role of value criteria and restrictions in humanisation of social relations and deployment of essential powers of a human being. The article specifies consequences of increase of the gap between the existing potential of human freedom and strengthening of its impersonal regulation with the help of modern technologies. It characterises social risks of re-formatting of the system of values and offers ways for preventive and adaptive socialisation of economic systems under conditions of globalisation...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2014 "Haggling With the Muses: Negotiating Value in 18 th Century English Poetry" {{argues that}} English poets {{writing in the}} 1730 s and 1740 s were {{substantially}} engaged with the emergent economic system {{as a result of}} their professional aspirations. In particular, I present an in-depth examination and reading of Edward Young's Night Thoughts, and show how Young channeled his frustrations at his lack of success into imagining an economic system that would privilege his own efforts. Young's poetry grapples with the concept of labor value vs. market value, the meaning of capital, and what it means to be <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> <b>individual.</b> His use of religious idiom enhances the complexity of his imagined system. Night Thoughts is part of the so-called Graveyard School; and in this dissertation, I investigate whether Young's engagement with economics was an isolated phenomenon, or a more widespread aspect of poetry from this period. Specifically, I examine the works of Thomas Parnell, James Thomson, and William Shenstone. I also explore the concepts of otherworldliness and virtue, both of which have been strongly associated with graveyard poetry. Earlier studies of eighteenth-century verse have often treated poems from the Graveyard School as products of simplistic religious piety, and as a transitional point between the high wit of the early eighteenth century and Romanticism. My research indicates that it is essential to the economic and professional situations of poets in order to understand the concerns that are likely to appear in their verse. I argue that eighteenth-century reading practices encouraged readers to extract short excerpts of verse for epigraphs and commonplace books, and that these activities obscured the economic content of Night Thoughts, and were responsible for the reputation of Young and his contemporaries as authors of melancholic Christian verse...|$|E

The results of the questionnaire survey carried out in 2012 are evaluated by the asymmetric dependence testing and estimation of ordinal regression models.

However, the predictive capacity of these strategies was low (Reynolds et al., 2004).

Estimates from these methods differ substantially, indicating that the determination of which technique is more appropriate is an important issue. The ordered method appears to be more consistent with the motivation of previous research and requires less computer time. Unordered models, however, are better able to predict occupational distribution. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{many local}} and state governments in the United States grapple with {{increasing}} growth pressures, the {{need to understand the}} economic and institutional factors underlying these pressures has taken on added urgency. From <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> perspective, <b>individual</b> land use decisions {{play a central role in}} the manifestation of growth pressures, as changes in land use pattern are the cumulative result of numerous individual decisions regarding the use of lands. In this study, the issue of growth management is addressed by developing a spatially disaggregated, microeconomic model of land conversion decisions suitable for describing residential land use change at the rural-urban fringe. The model employs parcel-level data on land use in Calvert County, Maryland, a rapidly growing rural-urban fringe county. A probabilistic model of residential land use change is estimated using a duration model, and the parameter estimates are employed to simulate possible future growth scenarios under alternative growth management scenarios. Results suggest that "smart growth" objectives are best met when policies aimed at concentrating growth in target areas are implemented in tandem with policies designed to preserve rural or open space lands.

The aim of the present paper is to propose a more comprehensive measure of well-being considering the role that wealth and permanent income play in simultaneously determining satisfaction with life. The results, based on representative microdata from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), suggest that both income and wealth increase satisfaction, that long-run income is more appropriate than short-term income and that satisfaction with life is particularly high for those who are at the top of both the income and wealth distributions. ...|$|R

40|$|Compulsory {{sterilization}} {{as a tool}} of eugenics {{occurred in}} the United States from before the U. S. Supreme Court upheld its’ constitutionality in 1927 until the early 1970 s.

In addition, interaction effects between income and assets, and income and debt, will be examined. Through the use of ordered probit regressions, we find that assets and debt must be included in order to model one’s subjective well-being. Interaction effects provide interesting insights, and these effects are discussed. However, in line with previous literature, we find that non-monetary factors are very important in explaining one’s level of happiness...|$|R
40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} that housing influences decisions to start businesses or become self-employed. Housing characteristics can facilitate or hinder business start-ups, and the mechanisms {{depend on whether}} the business start-up takes place in people’s homes or not. Hitherto, economic geography has largely viewed housing as a system that accommodates and filters the workforce across space and neglected that housing is <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> resource to <b>individuals.</b> Using longitudinal microdata for the United Kingdom and a sample that accounts for the endogeneity of housing to employment/entrepreneurship, the study finds that home-based self-employment is facilitated by housing wealth, outright ownership, detached houses, and large dwellings and is undermined by living in flats. Private rented accommodation enables entries into self-employment that are not based in people’s homes. Housing thus provides financial security and space, on the one hand, and shapes flexibility needed for entrepreneurship, on the other hand. Areas for future research arising from this study relate {{to the role of}} housing over the individual entrepreneur’s life course and area effects on entrepreneurship and self-employment that relate to the spatial variation of housing supply...|$|R

40|$|Some {{theories}} about the positive impact of markets on morality suggest that competition increases empathy, not between competitors, but between them and third parties. However, empathy may be a necessary evolutionary antecedent to guile, which is when someone knows what the other person wants and intentionally deceives him or her, and deception may have evolved {{as a means of}} exploiting empathy. This paper examines how individuals primed for empathy behave towards third parties in <b>a</b> simple <b>economic</b> game of deception. It reports the results of a data entry experiment in an online labor market. Individuals enter data randomized to be a prime for empathy, for guile, or a control. Empathy is then measured using a Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and guile is measured using <b>a</b> simple <b>economic</b> game. <b>Individuals</b> primed for empathy become less deceptive towards third parties. Individuals primed for guile become less likely to perceive that deceiving an individual is unfair in a vignette. These results are robust to a variety of controls and to restricting to workers who entered the prime accurately. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that empathy causes guile and suggests that empathy may cause those who are making judgements to become less deceptive...|$|R
