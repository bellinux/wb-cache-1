25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; I want my songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

Liam Gallagher {{collected}} the award alone before presenting his speech, which thanked Bonehead, McGuigan and Alan White but not his brother, Noel. Liam threw his microphone and the band's award into the crowd. On 15 March 2010, Liam defended his actions at the awards ceremony, saying [...] "I'm sick of it all being <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Noel, {{the last couple of}} months has pretty much been all <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> him so I thought it was only right to mention the other lads who played on the album and the best fans in the world," [...] and [...] "I thought it was a nice gesture to give this to the fans, obviously it was misinterpreted as per usual."

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life. He got drunk {{for the first time}} at age 13, and on more than one occasion, Valo has also been {{reported}} to have performed intoxicated. In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he opened the door and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|To me it wasn't a {{song about}} romance, it was <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Jim Steinman. We'd had a load of {{problems}} with managers in the early '80s {{and all of a}} sudden after five years we started to communicate. After I'd been to his house, he sent me the song, and it was [...] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now". Not the line 'When you kiss me like that', but the emotional connection. It doesn't have to be literal.|$|E
500|$|... "It’s <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my ex-boyfriend, and our tumultuous, {{psychotic}} relationship. We’d act weird, like {{drug addicts}} with each other, calling and {{seeing each other}} all the time. I was in love at the time, and (the song) sounds pretty happy, but it’s {{a little bit of a}} dark song. You’re so obsessed with somebody you start acting like a weirdo. … I write about falling in love, being in love, breaking up because he’s a loser, being heartbroken. I not only sing about getting rowdy, but love." ...|$|E

60|$|Self-conceit is {{the very}} {{daughter}} of self-will, and of that loud crying out <b>about</b> I, <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> mine, which {{is the very}} bird-call for all devils, and the broad road which leads to death.|$|R
500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that <b>about</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that?

500|$|Yankovic {{was dismayed}} by the album's lackluster reception. He noted that he [...] "thought {{it was the end}} of [...] career". Yankovic {{explained}} that [...] "I figured I'd peaked with 'Eat It' and 'Like a Surgeon' and now people were slowly forgetting <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I was well on my way to obscurity." [...] However, Yankovic's next album, Even Worse, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that [...] "careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gotta Have It" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop artists Kanye West and Jay-Z {{from their}} first {{collaborative}} album Watch the Throne (2011).

The song explores themes of wealth, decadence and the economic stature in the US. The song received positive reviews from critics who complimented the production and the clever wordplay of the two rappers.|$|E

500|$|Hill met {{her partner}} as of 2004, chef Brad Lynch, on a {{climbing}} trip in Moab, Utah, {{and at the}} age of 42, she gave birth to a son. Hill has spoken frequently about how having a child lessened the amount of time she had for climbing but not her love for it. As she said in one interview, [...] "I feel that right now, it doesn't have to be all <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my experiences. I was ready to begin a new role; to face new challenges and adventures as a mother. It's a good learning experience adjusting to the sacrifices that need to be made." ...|$|E
500|$|... "People were {{literally}} scared of my records. There {{have been so}} many rumors <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my records. People got the first album, and they would just make up stories. They'd get into an accident and be like, 'I got into an accident because I was playing that tape.' It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention. [...] We said {{a lot of things that}} people wanted to say but didn't say. We talked about a lot of political and social [...] that people didn't want to talk about." ...|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt [...] "scared and vulnerable" [...] while filming Jersey Girl, adding [...] "I was so used to those {{other elements of the}} character [...] On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> Ben sitting there, just shooting off dialogue." [...] However, she reiterated that doing Jersey Girl was what she wanted to do.|$|E

500|$|... "Welcome to the Family" [...] {{features}} {{a recording of}} Andrew Wade's heart beat {{towards the end of}} the track. The title track, [...] "Homesick", was written as one piece, before being split into two songs, which the band thought didn't work well and changed it back to one song. McKinnon said he was [...] "proud" [...] of the track: [...] "My parents were really happy when they first heard it: My dad is always worried <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my mom really did ask me to write her some soft songs. I finally did." [...] "Holdin' It Down for the Underground" [...] came about after McKinnon lost two family members and writing the song helped him relieve the pain.|$|E
500|$|Victoria's son {{remembered her}} fondly: [...] "My mother was very quick on the uptake, very talkative, very {{aggressive}} and argumentative. With her marvellous brain she sharpened people's wits." [...] Her granddaughter thought her [...] "formidable, but never intimidating... a supremely honest woman, full of commonsense and modesty." [...] Victoria wrote her own typically forthright epitaph {{at the end}} of her life in letters to and conversation with her son: [...] "What will live in history is the good work done by the individual & that has nothing to do with rank or title... I never thought I would be known only as your mother. You're so well known now and no one knows <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I don't want them to." ...|$|E
500|$|The early {{development}} of the script began while Kurt Wimmer was doing interviews promoting Equilibrium. In a November 2002 interview, he discussed what scripts he was working on. [...] He stated that [...] "I have several scripts – foremost of which is one called The Far-Reaching Philosophy of Edwin A. Salt – kind of a high-action spy thriller..." [...] In another interview, Wimmer described the project as [...] "very much <b>about</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my wife". The plot incorporated many elements from Equilibrium, with an oppressive and paranoid political system of brainwashing that gets overthrown by one of its high-ranking members who rebels due to an emotional transformation. With the shortened title Edwin A. Salt, the script was sold to Columbia Pictures in January 2007. By July 2007, the script had {{attracted the attention of}} Tom Cruise.|$|E
60|$|However, I did {{the child}} no harm; I did {{not so much}} as fright it, for I had a great many tender {{thoughts}} <b>about</b> <b>me</b> yet, <b>and</b> did nothing but what, as I may say, mere necessity drove me to.|$|R
60|$|I was shocked. Such a want of tact and delicacy! Common propriety {{suggested}} that a point-blank intimation of that nature should be conveyed in a private interview; or, still better, by note. I immediately rose, tucked my jacket <b>about</b> <b>me,</b> bowed, <b>and</b> departed.|$|R
