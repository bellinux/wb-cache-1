50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> or masked titi (Callicebus personatus) is {{a species}} of titi, a type of New World monkey, endemic to Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic titis {{are usually}} monogamous (they stay with one mate {{throughout}} their entire lifespan). They have one offspring per year. It {{is difficult to}} distinguish between the sexes externally, however <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> family dynamics indicate that the father carries the infant at all times during the nursing.|$|E
50|$|Other {{protected}} species include the northern brown howler (Alouatta guariba guariba), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> (Callicebus personatus), giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), cougar (Puma concolor), jaguar (Panthera onca), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), the ant Dinoponera lucida, Hercules beetle (Dynastes hercules) and the Characiformes fish Rachoviscus graciliceps.|$|E
40|$|The recently-discovered titi, Callicebus coimbrai, is {{endemic to}} the coastal Brazilian Atlantic Forest {{south of the}} São Francisco River, a region with a long {{tradition}} of deforestation. While a number of C. coimbrai populations have now been identified, little is known about basic population parameters. Considering the importance of this information for conservation planning, the population of a site in southern Sergipe (with a total area of forest of approximately 500 ha) was surveyed between April and October 2008. Standard line transect procedures were used in the four largest fragments, and additional monitoring included the use of playback broadcasts for the observation of titi groups. The presence of titis was confirmed in all the forest fragments at the site, including one of only five hectares. Two other primates - Callithrix jacchus and Cebus xanthosternos - were also recorded at the site, but were less abundant than titis. A total transect walk of 476 km provided 164 sightings of primates, the majority of which (104) were of Callicebus coimbrai. Titi groups ranged in size between two and five individuals. The most reliable estimate of overall population density, derived from the combined data set, was 12. 6 individuals per km²;, although density was much higher in smaller (more disturbed) fragments. The total population of Callicebus coimbrai at the site was estimated to be at least 50 individuals, which may represent a considerable proportion {{of the population of the}} species remaining in the wild. In addition to its apparent tolerance of habitat fragmentation, densities of C. coimbrai recorded at the site compare favourably with those of other <b>Atlantic</b> Forest <b>titi</b> species...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Callicebus which is {{composed}} of thirteen species and sixteen subspecies. More specifically, they belong to the group Callicebus moloch which is composed of eight species and eight subspecies. Three subspecies of Callicebus personatus have been described in scientific literature: C.p. melanochir, C.p. nigrifrons, and C.p. personatus. Atlantic titis are territorial, middle-sized, cebid monkeys; usually 1-2 kg in size. C. personatus are found primarily in the humid forests east of the Andes Mountains, specifically in the coastal, inland forests of south-eastern Brazil. The states they have been documented to dwell within include Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and São Paulo. Of all the Callicebus species, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> monkeys have the largest geographic range except for C. torquatus, covering approximately 1,000 kilometers. They customarily share their living area with other monkeys such as the lion tamarin and spider monkey.|$|E
50|$|Protected {{birds in}} the reserve include the red-browed amazon (Amazona rhodocorytha), white-necked hawk (Leucopternis lacernulatus), Atlantic black-breasted {{woodpecker}} (Celeus torquatus tinnunculus), rufous-brown solitaire (Cichlopsis leucogenys), purple-winged ground dove (Claravis godefrida), black-bellied thorntail (Discosura langsdorffi), Salvadori's antwren (Myrmotherula minor) and brown-backed parrotlet (Touit melanonotus).Protected mammals include the maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>titi</b> (Callicebus personatus), northern muriqui (Brachyteles hypoxanthus), buffy-headed marmoset (Callithrix flaviceps), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and cougar (Puma concolor capricornensis).Other protected species include the black uruçu (Melipona capixaba) and pinthous mimic white (Moschoneura pinthous methymna).|$|E
