5000|$|In contrast, {{regarding}} an <b>apparatus</b> <b>claim,</b> the Board {{stated that}} [...] {{a computer system}} suitably programmed {{for use in a}} particular field, even if that is the field of business and economy, has the character of a concrete apparatus {{in the sense of a}} physical entity, man-made for a utilitarian purpose and is thus an invention within the meaning of Article 52(1) EPC.|$|E
5000|$|Therefore, an <b>apparatus</b> <b>claim</b> {{comprising}} clearly {{technical features}} such as a [...] "server computer", [...] "client computers" [...] and a [...] "network" [...] is an invention {{within the meaning of}} Article 52(1) EPC (as held in T 931/95). But, the Board also held that the approach also applies to method claims, thus departing from T 931/95. The Board justified this with the following analysis: ...|$|E

50|$|Justice Hall, for the Court, {{states that}} “The patent in suit {{includes}} <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> {{under which the}} respondent is entitled {{to the benefit of}} s. 58”, which implies that the prior use defence can only apply if the patent has <b>claimed</b> an <b>apparatus.</b> However, Ford’s apparatus did not come within the scope of the <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims,</b> yet Ford received the benefit of section 58, which implies that <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> are not necessary for Ford to rely on section 58. The Court later states that “On the view that there is but one invention in the patent, Ford is entitled to rely on the specification as a whole to show that its machine is an “invention” for which the patent in suit was obtained.” Here, Justice Hall seems to conclude {{that as long as the}} patented invention covers Ford’s machine, the prior user defence is applicable. This interpretation is consistent with the view that <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> are not necessary and that to rely on the prior user defence, Ford’s machine must merely be disclosed in the specification of the patent as an aspect of the claimed invention. Commentators have reached a similar conclusion.|$|R

5000|$|This {{distinction}} of treatment between methods and apparatuses is {{justified by the}} mention of [...] "method" [...] but not apparatus in the exclusion of Art. 52(2)(c) EPC. The recent decision T 258/03 does not make this distinction between method and <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> anymore.|$|R
50|$|By {{relying on}} the ruling of another similar case Fantasy Sports Props v.

50|$|Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company {{was issued}} a patent for an {{apparatus}} and method for pressing curved glass. Prior to {{the issuance of}} the patent, Ford Motor Company of Canada installed and used machines to press curved glass windshields for cars.

Libbey therefore sued Ford for patent infringement.|$|R
5000|$|However, the Federal Circuit {{pointed out}} these two cases were {{actually}} different. The claim at that {{case was a}} method claim and it required performance of each claimed step in order to trigger infringement. The claims held by Finjan's '194 and '780 patent were [...] "system" [...] and [...] "storage medium" [...] claims, which were considered as <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> and did not require performance of any method steps. Merely “literal” presence of the software or binary code in the accused product is enough for infringement to occur.|$|R

If, however, the mathematical algorithm is merely presented and solved by the claimed invention, {{as was the case in}} Benson and Flook, and is not applied in any manner to physical elements or process steps, no amount of post-solution activity will render the claim statutory; nor is it saved by a preamble merely reciting the field of use of the mathematical algorithm.|$|R

The patent in suit includes <b>apparatus</b> <b>claims</b> under which the respondent is entitled to the benefit of s. 58. The immunity in respect of that specific apparatus necessarily includes immunity to use the apparatus under such method or process claims as may be included in a patent subsequently obtained for the apparatus.|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{from the}} broad {{proposition}} {{that art is}} a site for contesting temporality, this paper considers the relationship between technology and time. Bernard Stiegler’s concepts of tertiary retention and epiphylogenesis are used to consider archaeological heritage and its data analysis in technological <b>apparatus.</b> The <b>claim</b> is made that {{in the process of}} producing heritage objects situated in a media environment as tertiary retentions, archaeology also (from a media-archaeological point-of-view) produces an artefactual matter in the technical support that is open to subsequent data analysis. This process of data extraction and subsequent re-immersion of the tertiary retention’s artefactual support into the epiphylogenetic is mapped onto Elie Ayache’s interpretation of implied volatility in the Black–Scholes–Merton model for valuing financial derivatives. The paper negotiates these schemas in order to flatten the relation between the topographic site and its mnemo-technic supports making the paradoxical claim that the circulation of the tertiary retention, the derivative, precedes and underwrites the liquidity of the topographic site. In part this paper tests its own readiness to jump between two registers: the value and interpretation of cultural artefacts and the value and pricing of financial commodities sketching semiotic lines of convergence between symbolic and financial economies...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} part {{on an ongoing}} project that takes a corpus {{linguistic}} approach to investigating the stylistic characteristics of popular fiction. Here we present a corpus stylistic analysis of Ian Fleming’s novel Casino Royale, focussing {{on such issues as}} the construction of character and the stylistic characteristics of the novel as a whole. In so doing we also discuss the methodological value of a corpus approach to stylistic analysis, and its potential for providing an objective way in to the analysis of long texts. We use WordSmith Tools (Scott 2004) and Wmatrix (Rayson 2005) to look at word frequencies, keywords, key semantic domains, clusters, concordances and semantic prosodies, and we look at {{the extent to which the}} results we obtain tie in with literary critical comment on the James Bond novels. Although this paper 40 focuses on one novel in particular, we also aim to discuss general theoretical issues concerning corpus stylistics. We argue that local categories of description are crucial to capture textual features in literary texts, and also contribute to the systematic apparatus that corpus linguistics suggests is necessary to describe language. In this respect, we aim to provide support for Sinclair’s (2004 : 51) assertion that ‘no systematic <b>apparatus</b> can <b>claim</b> to describe language if it does not embrace the literature also’...|$|R
40|$|Sinclair (2004 : 51) points out: “[l]iterature is a {{prime example}} of {{language}} in use; no systematic <b>apparatus</b> can <b>claim</b> to describe language if it does not embrace the literature also”. Corpus linguistics stresses the importance of data as evidence of language use. The study of literary texts, however, has not received much attention yet within corpus linguistics, not least because it seems that for the corpus methodology, literature presents a difficult task. Although creativity and literariness can be described against the background of norms of language, the features that are crucial for one specific text are not always straightforward to identify and describe. The present paper looks at the example of Ian Fleming’s novel Casino Royale and explores corpus stylistic approaches to the study of this text. We will look at issues that are raised by frequency information for a single novel, and we will discuss routes for analysis that are suggested by computer key words and the comparison of one novel with a general purpose corpus such as the BNC and more specific collections of prose fiction. The paper is not only interested in the description of a particular novel, but also aims to discuss general theoretical questions. It will be argued that local categories of description are crucial to capture textual features in literary texts, and – at the same time – have to play a part in the systematic apparatus that corpus linguistics suggests to describe language...|$|R

6000|$|This {{edition of}} his [...] "Poetical Works" [...] {{contains}} all Shelley's ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print. In preparing the volume I have worked {{as far as possible}} on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority. I have not been content to reprint Mrs. Shelley's recension of 1839, or that of any subsequent editor of the [...] "Poems". The present text {{is the result of a}} fresh collation of the early editions; and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote. Again, wherever--as in the case of [...] "Julian and Maddalo"--there has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps, the fact is announced, and the substituted exemplar indicated, in the Prefatory Note. in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the [end] of the [relevant work]; but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a variorum edition, in the proper sense of the term--the textual <b>apparatus</b> does not <b>claim</b> to be exhaustive. Thus I have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by Mrs. Shelley, apparently on her own authority, into the texts of 1839; nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by Rossetti and others in recent times. But it is hoped that, up to and including the editions of 1839 at least, no important variation of the text has been overlooked. Whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority, a reference to the particular source has been added below.|$|R
40|$|In sorne electoral {{proceeding}} {{there can}} -and do [...] occur two phenomena {{which are in}} a certain manner foreign to the normal schema: blank votes and nonparticipation. Generally, electoral norms do not give any solutions for the interpretation of these phenomena, {{and if they do}} insome instances, they are usually srbitrary in nature. The problem would be merely academic if it were not related to the right of resistence of every citizen. In point of fact, the citizen cannot always choose between acceptable possibilities: it may happen that one of the options offered -or several, or a/l of them- are absolutely unacceptable to him, and therefore he cannot uphold any of them. For the solution of the problem it is necessary to examine the nature of the vote in itself. In this perspective, there exist two principal positions: the electorate as a funcion and the electorate as a right. According to the first position, voting is a complex act of potestas and auctoritas, which confers the potestas to those who govern or to the law subjected to voting. With the second theory, it is understood that the potestas already resides with the State, and that voting is exclusively a right which he citizen reserves within the social pacto According to the theory of the electorate as a function, voting confers potestas, wha,tever the content, to the result of the election, no matter what result this may be. Thus, blank votes confer potestas, expressing only that the voter has not formed any sufficiently clear idea with regard to the content of the options available. Nonparticipation, on the other hand, presupposes the negation of the conferring of potestas, and in principie this can be castigated. The voter performs a public function. In this theory, blank votes could be interpreted as indecislons, whereas nonparticipation would be interpreted as resistence.. According to the theory of the electorate as a right, the vote does not conter potestas, but is rather merely he exercise of a right, which can be renounced as can any right. Therefore, nonparticipation is the renunciation of a right, due elther to indecision or to whim. Resistence, hence, in this view would be expressed through blank votes or via derisory declarations. The Spanish set of laws with regard to the electoral process is more or less confused, but in the extent in which we can apply to it the schema presented aboye, it adopts the thesis of the electorate as a function, a thesis which is at the present moment undergoing crisis. It is necessa'ry that the legislator makes a decision to impede that any party in its propagandistic <b>apparatus</b> may <b>claim</b> for itself blank votes or abstentions, and to serve tor the resolution of conflictive hypotheses in which any citizen may find protected, in a certain way, his right of resistence in the face of radically unjust situations...|$|R
