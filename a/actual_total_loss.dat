We prospectively studied 546 patients with hip fracture. The <b>total</b> blood <b>loss</b> was calculated {{on the basis of the}} haemoglobin difference, the number of transfusions and the estimated blood volume. The hidden blood loss, in excess of that observed during surgery, varied from 547 ml (screws/ pins) to 1473 ml (intramedullary hip nail and screw) and was significantly associated with medical complications and increased hospital stay. The type of surgery, treatment with aspirin, intra-operative hypotension and gastro-intestinal bleeding or ulceration were all independent predictors of blood loss. We conclude that <b>total</b> blood <b>loss</b> after surgery for hip fracture is much greater than that observed intra-operatively. Frequent post-operative measurements of haemoglobin are necessary to avoid anaemia.

A mathematical model was developed that uses matrices to describe amounts of product losses for a single step or a sequence of steps in foodservice processing. This paper reports a pilot study undertaken to apply the mathematical model to monitor losses of whipped potatoes throughout all stages (heating, mixing, transfer of product and pre-service holding for a 1 hr. period) of food product flow as would occur in a conventional foodservice system. The model was used to estimate losses of water, solids and vitamin C. Losses in the ex-perimental product were greatest for the third process step-tranfer of product, and least following pre-service holding. Such a managerial approach {{would be useful to}} the foodservice industry in documenting and minimizing losses.

50|$|When {{considering}} a rating structure for satellite insurance coverage, {{during the early}} days many insurers based their rating according to the launch vehicle. For example, if the launch vehicle being used had a one in ten failure rate, the insurance premium would be ten per cent of the gross cost.

5000|$|These {{two terms}} {{are used to}} {{differentiate}} the degree of proof where a vessel or cargo has been lost. An <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> occurs where the damages or cost of repair clearly equal or exceed {{the value of the}} property. A constructive total loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value. The use of these terms is contingent on there being property remaining to assess damages, which is not always possible in losses to ships at sea or in total theft situations. In this respect, marine insurance differs from non-marine insurance, where the insured is required to prove his loss. Traditionally, in law, marine insurance was seen as an insurance of [...] "the adventure", with insurers having a stake and an interest in the vessel and/or the cargo rather than simply an interest in the financial consequences of the subject-matter's survival.|$|E

Failure to do so is known as non-disclosure or concealment (there are minor differences in the two terms) and renders the insurance voidable by the insurer.:§33(3): If warranty be not exactly complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.:§34(2): where a warranty has been broken, it is no defence to the insured that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, prior to the loss.:§34(3): a breach of warranty may be waived (ignored) by the insurer.:§39(1): implied warranty that the vessel must be seaworthy at the start of her voyage and for the purpose of it (voyage policy only).:§39(5): no warranty that a vessel shall be seaworthy during the policy period (time policy). However, if the assured knowingly allows an unseaworthy vessel to set sail the insurer is not liable for losses caused by unseasworthiness.:§50: a policy may be assigned.

40|$|To {{what extent}} should insureds expect {{compensation}} on interruption to their voyage by loss of possession or free use or disposal {{of their property}} where it remains undamaged? Marine insurance does not compensate for partial losses occasioned by delay. Recent authority (Masefield v Amlin Corporate Member) confirmed an insured could not recover for an <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> following capture where pirates would accept ransom then release the property. Property was not an <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> even after condemnation by a foreign tribunal (Panamanian Oriental Steamship Corporation v Wright), although condemnation might establish constructive total loss. Where the voyage becomes impossible by detention or embargo, the insured’s right to abandon to insurers for constructive total loss may be unpredictable (eg after one year’s duration in The Bamburi). In each scenario, insurers are excused making prompt payments, and from dealing themselves {{with the consequences of}} the peril. In each the insured is either uncompensated, or at best must wait. These authorities document an evolution; historically, English and American laws allowed the insured to abandon and recover for a total loss while these perils lasted, ignoring ongoing hopes of recovery. This thesis argues that a presumption of total loss still applies to all perils causing loss of possession. This appeared first in Continental treatises and was later applied in English law. No universal test of total loss applies equally to all marine perils. Instead, situations of loss of possession should be governed by peril-specific rules, including the presumption of total loss for perils causing loss of possession...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} secure the policyholders against losses due to {{earthquakes}} that are common natural calamities in Taiwan, the government launched a residential earthquake insurance system several years ago. Policyholders can be indemnified by <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim for quake-related losses of property. Despite {{there are many other}} professionals involved in the assessment procedure for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim, the qualified adjustors from underwriters are pivotal to the assessment of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims. The qualified adjustors are personnel of non-life insurance companies that underwent training courses for earthquake building damage assessment {{and many of them are}} not professionals in civil engineering. Their determination of <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claims are based on claim standard operation procedure (SOP) established by Taiwan Residential Earthquake Insurance Fund (TREIF) and mainly relies on personal experience and knowledge of earthquake building damages. Furthermore, considering that reinforced concrete buildings account for more than 76 % effective policies in Taiwan, a quantified <b>loss</b> model for <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> claim determination for RC buildings has been developed in 2009.

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the <b>total</b> <b>losses</b> {{associated with the}} season, transportation distance, and slaughter age during the transportation of broilers from poultry farms to slaughterhouses in Turkey. All data and parameters were statistically analyzed and the change in <b>total</b> <b>loss</b> during transportation was evaluated by two-way analysis of variance to determine which factors or variables affect this change. <b>Total</b> transportation <b>losses</b> were compared among the four seasons of the year, two slaughter ages (younger broiler, 31 - 39 days of age; older broilers 40 - 46 days of age) and three distance ranges (short, ≤ 50 km; medium, 51 - 150 km; and long, ≥ 151 km). <b>Total</b> <b>losses</b> of 259. 40 g, 307. 35 g, and 350. 14 g were determined for short, medium and long distances, respectively, indicating that losses increased with transportation distance (p< 0. 05).

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} size {{matching}} between {{donor and recipient}} is unclear in lung transplantation. Therefore, we determined the relation of donor lung size to 1) posttransplant survival and 2) pulmonary function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second. MethodsFrom 1990 to 2006, 469 adults underwent lung transplantation with lungs from donors aged 7 to 70 years. Donor and recipient total lung capacities were calculated using established formulae (predicted total lung capacity), and actual recipient lung size was measured in the pulmonary function laboratory. Disparity between donor and recipient lung size was expressed as a ratio of donor predicted total lung capacity to recipient predicted total lung capacity—the predicted total lung capacity ratio—and predicted donor total lung capacity to <b>actual</b> recipient <b>total</b> lung capacity—the <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio. Survival was measured by multiphase hazard methodology and repeated measures of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey–normalized forced expiratory volume in 1 second analyzed by temporal decomposition. ResultsPredicted total lung capacity ratio and <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio ranged widely, from 0. 55 to 1. 59 and 0. 52 to 4. 20, respectively. Overall survival was unaffected by predicted total lung capacity ratio (P =. 3) or <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio (P =. 5). Patients with emphysema and an <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio of 0. 67 or less or 1. 03 or greater had higher predicted mortality (P =. 01). During the first posttransplant year, forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased and then gradually declined. Predicted total lung capacity ratio and <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio had a small impact on forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primarily in the late phase after transplant in a disease-specific manner. ConclusionSize matching between donor and recipient using predicted total lung capacity ratio and <b>actual</b> <b>total</b> lung capacity ratio is an effective technique. Wide discrepancies in lung sizing do not affect overall posttransplant survival or pulmonary function. Therefore, {{a greater degree of}} lung size mismatch can likely be accepted, thereby improving patients' odds of undergoing transplantation...|$|R
