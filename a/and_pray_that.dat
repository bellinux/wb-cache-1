500|$|Soon after Stefani joined No Doubt, she and bandmate Tony Kanal began dating: {{she stated}} {{that she was}} heavily {{invested}} in that relationship. Stefani commented that [...] "...all I ever did was look at Tony <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> God would {{let me have a}} baby with him." [...] During this time, the band almost split up because of the failed romantic relationship between Stefani and Kanal. Kanal ended the relationship.

500|$|All {{of these}} new things {{entering}} my life are changing the way I view my purpose, but 'Dance in the Dark' in particular is about me wanting to live—but also, the song isn't called 'Dance in the Light'. I'm not a gospel singer trying to cross people over. What I'm saying is, 'I get it. I feel you, I feel the same way, and it's OK.' I hope <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> I can inspire some sort of change in people subliminally through the show. They're singing 'Dance in the Dark,' but they're dancing and they're free, they're letting it out. But the songs are not about freedom, they're about [...] I get it. I feel the way you feel.|$|E

500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> he can do a much better job when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E

She said that her [...] "role was {{to pass on the}} information and hope <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> it will be investigated. I was ostracised, but I did it {{for the people of the}} country. I wanted to assist government to root out the few bad apples."

It was [...] "entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews, whom {{it was a matter}} of great urgency to expel from all German territory," [...] according to Léon Poliakov. James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a [...] "fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst, unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians." [...] Luther said, [...] "we want to practice Christian love toward them <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> they convert," [...] but also that they are [...] "our public enemies... and if they could kill us all, they would gladly do so.

2500|$|Gasparri {{approached}} Ratti before voting {{began on}} the third day and told him he would urge his supporters to switch their votes to Ratti, who was shocked to hear this. When it became clear that neither Gasparri nor del Val could win, the cardinals approached Ratti, thinking him a compromise candidate not identified with either faction. Cardinal Gaetano de Lai approached Ratti and was believed to have said: [...] "We will vote for Your Eminence if Your Eminence will promise that you will not choose Cardinal Gasparri as your secretary of state". Ratti is said to have responded: [...] "I hope <b>and</b> <b>pray</b> <b>that</b> among so highly deserving cardinals the Holy Spirit selects someone else.

2500|$|The same General Convention also voted that [...] "any ordained ministry" [...] {{is open to}} gay men and lesbians.

[...] A noted Evangelical scholar of the New Testament, N.T. Wright, who is also Bishop of Durham in the Church of England, wrote in The Times (London) that the vote [...] "marks a clear break with the rest of the Anglican Communion" [...] and formalizes the Anglican schism. [...] However, in another resolution the Convention voted to [...] "reaffirm the continued participation" [...] and [...] "reaffirm the abiding commitment" [...] of the Episcopal Church with Anglican Communion.|$|E

The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.|$|E
