40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{recently}} completed to demonstrate an inlet-distortion-tolerant engine control system. These flight tests {{were part of}} NASA's High Stability Engine Control (HISTEC) program. The objective of the HISTEC program was to design, develop, and flight demonstrate an advanced integrated engine control system that uses measurement-based, real-time estimates of inlet <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> to enhance engine stability. With improved stability and tolerance of inlet <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion,</b> future engine designs may benefit from a reduction in design stall-margin requirements and enhanced reliability, with a corresponding increase in performance and decrease in fuel consumption. This paper describes the HISTEC methodology, presents an aircraft test bed description (including HISTEC-specific modifications) and verification and validation ground tests. Additionally, flight test safety considerations, test plan and technique design and approach, and flight operations are addressed. Some illustrative results are presented to demonstrate the type of analysis and results produced from the flight test program...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} an altitude test chamber {{to determine the effects}} of inlet <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> on the compressor steady-state and surge characteristics of a high-pressure ratio, axial-flow turbojet engine. Circumferential-type inlet flow distortions were investigated, which covered a range of distortion sector angles from 20 deg to 168 deg and distortion levels up to 22 percent. The presence of inlet airflow distortions at the compressor face resulted in a substantial increase in the local pressure ratio in the distorted region, primarily for the inlet stages. The local pressure ratio in the distorted region for the inlet stages increased as either the distortion sector angle decreased or the percent distortion increased. The average compressor-surge pressure ratio was much more sensitive to inlet airflow distortions at lower engine speeds than at engine speeds near rated. Hence, compressor-surge margin reduction due to inlet <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> was quite severe at the lower engine speeds. Although the average compressor-surge pressure ratio was generally reduced with inlet flow distortion, local pressure ratios across the distorted sector of the compressor were obtained during surge and were significantly greater than the normal compressor-surge pressure ratio. This was a result of increased loading of the inlet stages in the distorted region...|$|E
40|$|A large dataset of wind stress estimates, {{covering}} {{a wide range}} of wind speed and stability conditions, was obtained during three cruises of the RRS Discovery in the Southern Ocean. These data were used by Yelland and Taylor to determine the relationship between 10 -m height, neutral stability values for the drag coefficient, and the wind speed, and to devise a new formulation for the nondimensional dissipation function under diabatic conditions. These results have been reevaluated allowing for the <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> caused by the ship. The acceleration and vertical displacement of the flow have been modeled in three dimensions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The CFD modeling was tested, first by comparison with wind tunnel measurements on models of two Canadian research ships and second, by analysis of data from four anemometers on the foremast of the RRS Charles Darwin. Originally, the four anemometers gave drag coefficient values that differed by up to 20 % from one to another and were all unexpectedly high. The CFD results showed that the airflow had been decelerated by 4 %– 14 % and displaced vertically by about 1 m. These effects caused the original drag coefficient results to be overestimated by up to 60 %. After correcting for flow distortion effects, the results from the different anemometers became consistent, which gave confidence in the quantitative CFD-derived corrections. The CFD modeling showed that the anemometer position on the RRS Discovery was much less affected by <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion.</b> For a given wind speed the CFD corrections reduced the drag coefficient by about 6 %. The resulting mean drag coefficient to wind speed relationship confirmed that suggested by Smith from a more limited set of open ocean data. The effects of flow distortion are sensitive to changes in the relative wind direction. It is shown that much of the scatter in drag coefficient estimates may be due to variations in <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> rather than to the effect of changing sea states. The Discovery wind stress data is examined for evidence of a sea-state dependence: none is found. It is concluded that a wave-age-dependent wind stress formulation is not applicable to open ocean conditions...|$|E

This report describes the results of simulations of the airflow around the RRS James Clark Ross made using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software VECTIS. The <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> at anemometer sites used during the WAGES project has been quantified at a wind speed of 10 m/s for relative wind directions of 0 (bow-on), 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 110 degrees off the bow. The anemometers {{used in this study}} were located in the bows of the ship. Temperature sensors were located on the port side of the monkey island. For bow-on flows the anemometers in the bows of the ship experienced relatively small flow distortion. At these sites the flow was decelerated by about 1 % of the free stream wind speed. Over the full range of relative wind directions the flow to the R 3 sonic is generally accelerated with the largest wind speed biases at flows directly over the beam. The vertical displacement of the airflow increases from around 1 to 2 m for flows directly over the bow, to around 5 m for flows over the ships beam as the blockage of the airflow by the ship becomes greater. The <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> at the temperature sensor locations above the monkey island was typically greater than the well-exposed foremast locations.

Detailed comparison is given between the numerical results and an extensive experimental dataset. The study is performed for the whole range of relative wind directions and for instruments located in regions of high and low flow distortion. The experimental data show that both the normalised wind speed and normalised standard deviation are only weakly dependent on wind speed, ship speed, ship motion and sea state, but strongly dependent on relative wind direction.

40|$|An {{issue of}} primary {{importance}} {{to the development of}} new jet and certain other airbreathing combined-cycle powered aircraft is the advancement of airframe-integrated propulsion technologies. Namely, engine inlets and their systems and subsystems are required to capture, convert, and deliver the atmospheric airflow demanded by such engines across their operating envelope in a form {{that can be used to}} provide efficient, stable thrust. This must be done while also minimizing aircraft drag and weight. Revolutionary inlet designs aided by new technologies are needed to enable new missions. An unwanted byproduct of pursuing these inlet technologies is increased time-variant <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion.</b> Such distortions reduce propulsion system stability, performance, operability, and life. To countermand these limitations and fully evaluate the resulting configurations, best practices dictate that this distortion be experimentally measured at large scale and analyzed. The required measurements consist of those made by an array of high-response pressure transducers located in the flow field at the aerodynamic interface plane (AIP) between the inlet and engine. Although the acquisition of the necessary pitot-pressure time histories is relatively straight-forward, until recent years, the analysis has proved to be very time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. To transform the analysis of these data into a tractable and timely proposition, researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center created and established the Rapid Analysis of Dynamic Data (RADD) system. The system provides complete, near real-time analysis of time-varying inlet <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> datasets with report quality output. This fully digital approach employs Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) binary data file format standardization to establish data-acquisition-system-independent processing on low cost personal computers.

40|$|An aircraft-based {{platform}} {{was developed}} to complement tower-based flux measurements. The ability to measure vertical eddy fluxes of gases from aircraft platforms represents an important capability to obtain spatially resolved data, but represents a unique challenge, when attempting to calibrate the aircraft-instrument combination. The primary calibration challenges involve {{the lack of a}} known “calibration standard” for atmospheric wind and the effects of the aircraft itself upon the local airflow around the flow measurement sensors. ^ The work documented herein consisted of three separate investigations to determine the airborne wind measurement precision of a particular aircraft-instrument combination. Rigorous tests of the particular airflow measurement probe in a wind tunnel were complemented with in-flight calibrations. The effect of <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> around the aircraft’s body on the measured relative airflow was determined through a simple set of in-flight maneuvers and data analysis. A least-squares estimate of the horizontal wind and measurement bias components was developed. These data were compared with an independent model using an internet-based program (called the HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, abbreviated “HYSPLIT”) to compute the wind trajectories in the atmosphere (the path of an air parcel). Estimates of the variability of actual atmospheric wind during an evaluation flight were performed. ^ The precision of the vertical wind measurement for spatial scales larger than approximately 2 m is independent of aircraft flight speed over the range of airspeeds studied and the 1 σ precision is approximately 0. 03 ms - 1. It was estimated, from flight test data, and from variations in aircraft attitude and airspeed in flux-measurement configuration, that the uncertainty in vertical wind measurement caused by varying lift-induced upwash is ∼ 0. 05 m s- 1.

40|$|Data from {{research}} vessels and merchant ships {{are used to}} estimate ocean CO 2 uptake via parameterizations of the gas transfer velocity (k) and measurements {{of the difference between}} the concentration of CO 2 in the ocean (p CO 2 sw) and atmosphere (p CO 2 atm) and of wind speed. Gas transfer velocities estimated using wind speed dependent parameterisations may be in error due to air flow distortion by the ship's hull and superstructure introducing biases into the measured wind speed. The effect of <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> on estimates of the transfer velocity was examined by modelling the airflow around the three-dimensional geometries of the research vessels Hakuho Maru and Mirai, using the Large Eddy Simulation code GERRIS. For airflows within ± 45 ° of the bow the maximum bias was + 16 %. For wind speed of 10 m s − 1 to 15 m s − 1, a + 16 % bias in wind speed would cause an overestimate in the calculated value of k of 30 % to 50 %, depending on which k parameterisation is used. This is due to the propagation of errors when using quadratic or cubic parameterizations. Recommendations for suitable anemometer locations on research vessels are given. The errors in transfer velocity may be much larger for typical merchant ships, as the anemometers are generally not as well-exposed as those on research vessels. Flow distortion may also introduce biases in the wind speed dependent k parameterizations themselves, since these are obtained by relating measurements of the CO 2 flux to measurements of the wind speed and the CO 2 concentration difference.

40|$|The Waves, Aerosol, and Gas Exchange Study (WAGES) {{collected}} 18 {{months of}} near-continuous and autonomous turbulent air-sea flux estimates {{from the research}} vessel RRS James Clark Ross. Supporting meteorological and sea-state measurements were also made, {{with the objective of}} improving air-sea flux parameterisations. Making turbulence measurements from a ship is technically challenging, due to bias caused by platform motion and <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion.</b> Typically, visual inspection of individual turbulence spectra is needed to quality control eddy covariance flux estimates; for WAGES the sheer volume of data motivated the development of an automated quality control method, to be performed on individual flux cospectra. The application of these tests allowed a robust relationship between the 10 m wind speed and the neutral drag coefficient to be developed, which had previously not been achieved with ship-based covariance measurements alone. This parameterisation is toward the higher end of the range of accepted values, and indicates some wind speed dependence of the Charnock parameter, rather than it being a constant. A detailed investigation of turbulent flow distortion was made; insights into the physics were gained, and a novel correction method for motion-correlated flow distortion was developed and validated. Two major modes of motion-correlated flow distortion of the turbulence were found: one correlated to the pitch, acknowledge in the literature; a second and more powerful mode correlated to the rate of change of the pitch, not acknowledged in any publication. The quality control and bias correction techniques developed for the momentum fluxes were transferred to a preliminary investigation of the sensible and latent heat fluxes. The uncertainty in the latent heat transfer coefficient was reduced considerably by use of the new techniques; however the sensible heat fluxes were dominated by noise, so discarded. The methods and corrections developed in this thesis could be used to reanalyse the turbulent flux measurements from many ship-based campaigns; improving our understanding of the physics of air-sea exchange without need for additional expensive measurements...|$|E
40|$|Data from platforms, {{research}} {{vessels and}} merchant ships {{are used to}} estimate ocean CO 2 uptake via parameterisations of the gas transfer velocity (k) and measurements {{of the difference between}} the partial pressures of CO 2 in the ocean (p CO 2 sw) and atmosphere (p CO 2 atm) and of wind speed. Gas transfer velocities estimated using wind speed dependent parameterisations may be in error due to air flow distortion by the ship's hull and superstructure introducing biases into the measured wind speed. The effect of <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> on estimates of the transfer velocity was examined by modelling the airflow around the three-dimensional geometries of the research vessels Hakuho Maru and Mirai, using the Large Eddy Simulation code GERRIS. For airflows within ± 45 ° of the bow the maximum bias was + 16 %. For wind speed of 10 m s − 1 to 15 m s − 1, a + 16 % bias in wind speed would cause an overestimate in the calculated value of k of 30 % to 50 %, depending on which k parameterisation is used. This is due to the propagation of errors when using quadratic or cubic parameterisations. Recommendations for suitable anemometer locations on research vessels are given. The errors in transfer velocity may be much larger for typical merchant ships, as the anemometers are generally not as well-exposed as those on research vessels. Flow distortion may also introduce biases in the wind speed dependent k parameterisations themselves, since these are obtained by relating measurements of the CO 2 flux to measurements of the wind speed and the CO 2 concentration difference. To investigate this, flow distortion effects were estimated for three different platforms from which wind speed dependent parameterisations are published. The estimates ranged from − 4 % to + 14 % and showed that flow distortion may {{have a significant impact on}} wind speed dependent parameterisations.

40|$|Anemometers on Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are usually}} located above the bridge {{in a region}} where the effects of air flow distortion, created by the {{presence}} of the ship, may be large. Until now it was not known whether measurements from such anemometers would be biased high or low, and the possible magnitude of any such bias was not known. Investigations into the airflow above merchant ships have been carried out experimentally using a low-speed wind tunnel and numerically using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code VECTIS. The investigations examined the airflow over simple block models of VOS shapes. The results of the investigations were compared to wind speed measurements made from the RRS Charles Darwin. Experimental and CFD techniques have been used to devise scaling rules that predict the effects of the flow distortion. Both techniques have shown that the pattern of the flow distortion above the bridge scales with the ‘step height’, H, of the model. In the case of a tanker, H is the ‘bridge to deck’ height, i. e. the height of the accommodation block above the deck, for bow-on flows. Close {{to the top of the}} bridge the flow is severely decelerated and may even reverse in direction. Using the upwind edge of the bridge as the origin of the scaled co-ordinate system, there is a definite line above the decelerated region along which the speed of the flow is equal to the undistorted wind speed. Above this ‘line of equality’ the wind speed increases to a maximum and then decreases with increased height to a free stream wind speed. Simple equations have been devised to predict the positions of the ‘line of equality’, the maximum wind speed and the minimum wind speed within the decelerated region. Comparisons of the results with wind speed data obtained from field measurements made using a number of anemometers located on the RRS Charles Darwin agreed well and have predicted a maximum wind speed increase of approximately 15 ± 5 %. Comparisons with the field data have confirmed that CFD models can be used to predict the effects of <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> above merchant ships. The investigation has demonstrated the ability of the wind tunnel and CFD approaches employed to provide a better understanding of the airflow over merchant ships. Both methods have contributed to improve the understanding of how the wind speed at anemometer sites on merchant ships is affected by the ships hull and superstructure. <br/...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring the FETCH {{experiment}} in NW Mediterranean Sea (March and April 1998), surface fluxes were measured {{on board a}} research vessel and on a moored buoy. To provide the ocean surface forcing at the mesoscale, output fields of three meteorological models (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and Meteo-France ARPEGE and ALADIN) were gathered as well as satellite data. To evaluate the consistency of model fields, we compare ship measurements to the predicted radiative and turbulent surface fluxes and to turbulent fluxes derived from analyses using a bulk formula. We first analyze {{the quality of the}} ship bulk fluxes in terms of possible effects of the flow distortion and of intrinsic variability as function of the integration time. The <b>airflow</b> <b>distortion</b> over the ship is found to significantly affect fluxes, but the mean fluxes over the experiment remain unchanged because of compensation between positive and negative errors due to the varying apparent wind direction. Spectral analysis of the ship time series as well as comparison of fluxes obtained by using several averaging times from 1 to 90 min show that the optimal scale for computing ship fluxes is about 20 min, ensuring consistency with the derivation of bulk drag and exchange coefficient. These fluxes are then taken as reference for the comparison with models and satellites. None of the predicted radiative fluxes is consistent with ship measurements. Model turbulent fluxes differ from each other, and the main reason is the discrepancy between modeled and observed atmospheric features. Large discrepancies are found between predicted fluxes and ship fluxes in strong wind conditions due to the different flux parameterization for heat fluxes. Model bulk fluxes thus compare better to ship than predicted fluxes, particularly during the middle period of the experiment depending on the model. On the contrary, the Meteosat-derived downward radiative fluxes are comparable to the ship data, and their high time sampling allows us to describe the diurnal cycle of the solar heating. They can be used either at an instantaneous scale (comparison of the satellite flux averaged over 0. 1 ° Â 0. 1 ° with 10 min averaged ship fluxes) or at a larger scale (0. 3 ° Â 0. 3 °, 1 hour). It is shown that the surface latent heat flux, derived from a combination of Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI) brightness temperatures and sea surface temperature (SST), as obtained from IR sensors (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), is of a quality similar or better to model bulk fluxes.
