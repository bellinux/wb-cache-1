5|$|In 1873, Willoughby Smith {{found that}} the {{electrical}} resistance of grey selenium was dependent on the <b>ambient</b> <b>light.</b> This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell {{was used in the}} photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium's semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} cephalopods, bigfin reef squids {{are capable of}} metachrosis – rapidly {{changing}} body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores. They also possess iridophores (particularly in the head), a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated. They are also possibly one of two squid species with leucophores. Leucophores are a reflector-type structural colouration that reflects <b>ambient</b> <b>light,</b> such that they are white in white light, green in green light, and so on. Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns {{from the moment they}} hatch. In comparison, other loliginid squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age. The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids, however, are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E

5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the field of view and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their field of view is the user's naked eye field of view, and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow field of view and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{radiological}} {{judgments are}} increasingly being made on softcopy LCD monitors. These monitors are found throughout the hospital environment in radiological reading rooms, outpatient clinics and wards. This means that <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> where clinical judgments from images are made can vary widely. Inappropriate <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> has several deleterious effects: monitor reflections reduce contrast; veiling glare adds brightness; dynamic range and detectability of low contrast objects is limited. Radiological images displayed on LCDs are {{more sensitive to the}} impact of inappropriate <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> and with these devices problems described above are often more evident. The current work aims to provide data on optimum <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting,</b> based on lesions within chest images. The data provided may be used for the establishment of workable <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> standards. <b>Ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> at 30 cms from the monitor was set at 480 Lux (office lighting) 100 Lux (WHO recommendations), 40 Lux and < 10 Lux. All monitors were calibrated to DICOM part 14 GSDF. Sixty radiologists were presented with 30 chest images, 15 images having simulated nodular lesions of varying subtlety and size. Lesions were positioned in accordance with typical clinical presentation and were validated radiologically. Each image was presented for 30 seconds and viewers were asked to identify and score any visualized lesion from 1 - 4 to indicate confidence level of detection. At the end of the session, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Analysis of the data suggests that visualization of chest lesions is affected by inappropriate lighting with chest radiologists demonstrating greater <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> dependency.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: <b>Ambient</b> {{interior}} <b>lighting</b> for vehicles {{provides an}} indirect illumination {{of the passenger}} compartment in low light settings. It has recently been gaining resonance in the automotive industry. Its advantages are in fact much coveted nowadays: a better orientation in the car, an improved sense of spaciousness, an impression of safety, value, and comfort. In this work, the influences of <b>ambient</b> interior <b>lighting</b> for vehicles on the driver’s perception and his emotional state have been researched. For this goal, three experimental studies have been carried out, two in laboratory conditions and one in real traffic conditions. In these studies the participants experienced various <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> scenarios while driving in a night time visual environment. For this purpose, two vehicle prototypes equipped with special <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> fixtures have been employed: a BMW 3 series and a MINI Clubman. The results allowed an insight into the driver’s perception of <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting.</b> Lighting colour, luminance and position significantly influenced the perception in various manners. The independent categories space perception and orientation, attractiveness and perceived quality, and perceived safety and attention resulted from {{the analysis of the}} obtained data. Through them, an assessment of the effects of <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> can be provided. In order to render an objective evaluation, a measurement method was developed which takes into account position, luminance, and illuminated area for the <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> features. The results were correlated to the subjective values of each lighting scenario, in order to define optimum values for such illumination. Lighting colour also significantly influences perception, though a clear correlation between wavelength and impression cannot be drawn. The knowledge of the subjective perception obtained within this work will support the industrial development process of <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> from the conceptual layout on...|$|R

In addition, people do not look natural with small pupils, and direct lighting from close to the camera lens is considered to produce unflattering photographs.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} devices feature {{an improved}} image-intensifier tube utilizing micro-channel plate (MCP) with an S-25 photocathode, {{resulting in a}} much brighter image, especially {{around the edges of}} the lens. This leads to increased illumination in low <b>ambient</b> <b>light</b> environments, such as moonless nights. Light amplification is around 20,000×. Also improved were image resolution and reliability.|$|E

30|$|With ever {{increasing}} energy {{costs and the}} push to reduce energy consumption, there is constant pressure {{to reduce the amount}} of energy devoted to lighting. Energy savings can be achieved by simply turning down the amount of <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> in the room, and supplementing light on work surfaces, such as table tops and desk tops, and in work spaces with task lighting. Because task lights do not need to generate the amount of light needed to illuminate an entire room, they consume less energy for the same task illumination level [1, 2]. From an energy efficiency point of view, only task lights would be used in a space, without <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting.</b> However, from a practical point of view, some <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> is required for circulation and safety and to provide visibility to surrounding architectural structure and amenities in the space. For example, if the <b>ambient</b> <b>lighting</b> in a task lit space were reduced from 400 lu× to 100 lu×, the energy savings would be appreciable. As a result, task-ambient lighting becomes more prevalent in many lighting applications.|$|R
