2500|$|The judge {{granted the}} prosecutor's motion for retrial, and held that an {{impartial}} jury {{could not be}} found in Ford's hometown, the heavily Democratic and predominantly black city of Memphis where Ford was very popular.

The jurors were to be bused into Memphis for the trial. Ford appealed this jury selection plan twice to the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that it violated his constitutional right to a jury of his peers; the appeals were denied twice. In 1993, Stuart Gerson, a hold-over Bush-appointee serving as <b>acting</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> sided with Ford's request for a jury from Memphis, but the federal judge hearing the trial rejected the request.
