500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Alonso described his race weekend as [...] "good overall" [...] and felt the one-two finish for Ferrari was a deserving and strong result. He felt that the team's motivation would drop {{in the event of}} poor finishes and stated that Ferrari would get overexcited after finishing strongly and did not see <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pessimistic for the next race of the season. Massa said it was a [...] "very good" [...] race for his team and that his tyres behaved better than he had expected. He felt he was not in the battle for the championship because he had lost a large number of valuable points and said every person recognised {{that he was able to}} win races and be competitive. Vettel said that despite losing two positions at the start of the race, he felt comfortable in his car and was happy to clinch a podium position at his home Grand Prix. Although he said he would have preferred to have scored more points, he felt third place was the best result his team could secure, a finish that Red Bull could be proud of.|$|E

2500|$|Trust is {{increased}} by oxytocin. Disclosure of emotional events {{is a sign}} of trust in humans. When recounting a negative event, humans who receive intranasal oxytocin share more emotional details and stories with more emotional significance. Humans also find faces more trustworthy after receiving intranasal oxytocin. In a study, participants who received intranasal oxytocin viewed photographs of human faces with neutral expressions and found them to be more trustworthy {{than those who did not}} receive oxytocin. This may be because oxytocin reduces the fear of social betrayal in humans. Even after experiencing social alienation by being excluded from a conversation, humans who received oxytocin scored higher in trust on the Revised NEO Personality Inventory. [...] Moreover, in a risky investment game, experimental subjects given nasally administered oxytocin displayed [...] "the highest level of trust" [...] twice as often as the control group. Subjects who were told they were interacting with a computer showed no such reaction, leading to the conclusion that oxytocin was not merely affecting risk aversion. When there is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distrustful, such as experiencing betrayal, differing reactions are associated with oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) differences. Those with the CT haplotype experience a stronger reaction, in the form of anger, to betrayal.|$|E

60|$|Here, for <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{explained}} presently, I will quote a {{very similar}} case which I saw at the Army Colony at Hadleigh, in Essex. This man, also a Scotsman (no Englishman, I think, could have survived such experiences), is a person of fine and imposing appearance, great bodily strength, and good address. He is about fifty years of age, {{and has been a}} soldier, and after leaving the Service, a gardener. Indeed, he is now, or was recently, foreman market-gardener at Hadleigh. He married a hospital nurse, and found out some years after marriage that she was in the habit of using drugs. This habit he contracted also, either during her life or after her death, and with it that of drink.|$|E
6000|$|Divine wisdom has {{commanded}} us to [...] "Honour {{your father}} and your mother." [...] Observant travellers affirm that less respect is paid to parents in America, than is usual in Christian nations--we say Christian nations; {{for many of the}} heathen, the Chinese for instance, worship them, though probably with an allegorical connection that we do not understand. That the parental tie is more loose in this country than in most others we believe, and there is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> found for it in the migratory habits of the people, and in the general looseness in all the ties that connect men with the past. The laws on the subject of matrimony, moreover, are so very lax, intercourse is so simple and has so many facilities, and the young of the two sexes are left so much to themselves, that it is no wonder children form that connection so often without reflection and contrary to the wishes of their friends. Still, the law of God is there, and we are among those who believe that a neglect of its mandates is very apt to bring its punishment, even in this world, and we are inclined to think that much of that which Mark and Bridget subsequently suffered, was in consequence of acting directly {{in the face of the}} wishes and injunctions of their parents.|$|E
60|$|Now I have no {{intention}} of setting down all the details of that dreadful journey through Zululand, even if I could recall them, which, for <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stated, I cannot do. I remember that at first I thought of proceeding to Ulundi with some wild idea of throwing myself on the mercy of Cetewayo under pretence that I brought him a message from Natal. Within a couple of hours, however, from the top of a hill I saw ahead of me an impi and with it captured wagons, which was evidently heading for the king's kraal. So as I knew what kind of a greeting these warriors would give me, I bore away in another direction with the hope of reaching the border by a circuitous route. In this too I had no luck, since presently I caught sight of outposts stationed upon rocks, which doubtless belonged to another impi or regiment. Indeed one soldier, thinking from my dress that I also was a Zulu, called to me for news from about half a mile away, in that peculiar carrying voice which Kaffirs can command. I shouted back something about victory and that the white men were wiped out, then {{put an end to the}} conversation by vanishing into a patch of dense bush.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{begin with}} the gospel of Matthew, bearing in mind {{that it does not}} profess to be the {{evidence}} of an eyewitness. It is a chronicle, founded, like other chronicles, on such evidence and records as the chronicler could get hold of. The only one of the evangelists who professes to give first-hand evidence as an eyewitness naturally takes care to say so; and the fact that Matthew makes no such pretension, and writes throughout as a chronicler, makes it clear that he is telling the story of Jesus as Holinshed told the story of Macbeth, except that, for <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given later on, he must have collected his material and completed his book within the lifetime of persons contemporary with Jesus. Allowance must also be made {{for the fact that the}} gospel is written in the Greek language, whilst the first-hand traditions and the actual utterances of Jesus must have been in Aramaic, the dialect of Palestine. These distinctions were important, as you will find if you read Holinshed or Froissart and then read Benvenuto Cellini. You do not blame Holinshed or Froissart for believing and repeating the things they had read or been told, though you cannot always believe these things yourself. But when Cellini tells you that he saw this or did that, and you find it impossible to believe him, you lose patience with him, and are disposed to doubt everything in his autobiography. Do not forget, then, that Matthew is Holinshed and not Benvenuto. The very first pages of his narrative will put your attitude to the test.|$|E
