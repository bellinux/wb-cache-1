25|$|The first {{homes built}} in the Boston–Edison Historic District were {{occupied}} in 1905, {{with the majority of}} the homes built between 1905 and 1925.

These homes range in size from modest two-story vernaculars to massive mansions set on sprawling grounds.

The cemetery was only completed in 1464. The outer wall is composed of 43 blind arches. There are two doorways.

500|$|DeHavilland {{turned to}} Warner's wife Anne for help. Warner later recalled, [...] "Olivia, {{who had a}} brain like a {{computer}} concealed behind those fawn-like eyes, simply went to my wife and they joined forces to change my mind." [...] Warner relented, and deHavilland was signed to the project {{a few weeks before}} the start of principal photography on January 26, 1939. Set in the American South during the 19th century, the film is about the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law, Melanie, whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her. According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavilland's skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. Gone with the Wind had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, and was well received. Frank S. Nugent of The Times wrote that deHavilland's Melanie [...] "is <b>a</b> <b>gracious,</b> dignified, tender gem of characterization", and John C. Flinn, Sr., in Variety called her [...] "a standout". The film won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deHavilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E

[...] Levine went on to call the track [...] "a Shoulda Been Smash, if only for Janet's boast that she's [...] "something heavy like a first-day period." [...] Keith Harris of Rolling Stone called the song a [...] "high-voltage money shot," [...] likening Jackson's vocals to a [...] "sex droid," [...] complete with [...] "crass" [...] beats and [...] "heavy breathing."

[...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song."

[...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort.

[...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E
