5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E

25|$|Historical sound {{change in}} Japanese {{has led to}} the modern pronunciations of the {{individual}} characters as nichi and hon. The pronunciation Nihon originated, possibly in the Kanto region, as a reintroduction of this independent pronunciation of 本 into the compound. This must have taken place during the Edo period, after <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> change occurred which would have resulted in this form becoming Niwon and later Nion.|$|E

25|$|The McGurk {{effect is}} a perceptual {{phenomenon}} that demonstrates an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception. The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of <b>another</b> <b>sound,</b> leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, {{they may be more}} likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener to hear it. The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E
2500|$|From 500 to 800, {{two great}} changes {{occurred}} within Proto-Norse. Umlauts appeared, {{which means that}} a vowel {{was influenced by the}} succeeding vowel or semivowel: Old Norse [...] (guest) came from P-N [...] (guest). <b>Another</b> <b>sound</b> change is known as vowel breaking in which the vowel changed into a diphthong: hjarta from *hertō or fjǫrðr from *ferþuz.|$|E

2500|$|One of the film's {{distinctive}} features is its score, written {{in three days}} by John Carpenter and performed by Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. Carpenter, assisted by Dan Wyman, had several banks of synthesizers that would each have to be reset when <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> had to be created, taking {{a great deal of}} time. [...] "When I did my original themes for [...] … it was done with very old technology," [...] replied Carpenter. [...] "It was very difficult to get the sounds, and it took very long to get something simple." [...] Carpenter made roughly three to five separate pieces of music and edited them to the film as appropriate.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was hoped}} that the 1934 series would heal the rift that had arisen between England and Australia {{as a result of}} the bodyline series and it succeeded in doing that. [...] With Jardine gone and in the absence of Wyatt, England had a new captain in Cyril Walters of Worcestershire for the First Test at Trent Bridge. [...] He opened the innings with Sutcliffe and they shared a stand of 45 after Australia had been {{dismissed}} for 374. [...] Walters was out for 17 and Sutcliffe made 62 in a total of 268. [...] Australia declared their second innings on 273–8, a lead of 379. [...] Although Sutcliffe and Walters made <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> start of 51 before Sutcliffe was out for 24, England collapsed to be all out for 141, Walters making top score with 46. [...] The damage was done by O'Reilly and Grimmett who took 11 and 8 wickets respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted <b>another</b> <b>sound</b> in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When I Reach For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E

2500|$|Neither {{team was}} able to score {{in the first three}} quarters. [...] At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Michigan drove to the Minnesota nine-yard line. [...] Following the three-minute {{intermission}} before the fourth quarter began, the drive stalled. [...] Fullback George Lawton attempted a field goal, but his kick missed the mark by a foot. [...] With five minutes remaining in the game, Michigan finally sustained a touchdown drive. [...] Michigan began the drive at its own 53-yard line (midfield was the 55-yard line in 1910). [...] With time running out, the Wolverines resorted to the forward pass. [...] On the first play of the drive, Stanfield Wells threw to Stanley Borleske for a gain of 27 yards to the Minnesota 30-yard line. [...] On the next play, Michigan ran the same play, and Borleske took the ball for 24 yards to the three-yard line. [...] Wells ran with the ball on first down and was stopped for no gain. [...] On second down, Wells again ran into the Minnesota defense. [...] With a crowd of players on top of Wells, it was not clear initially whether he had crossed the goal line. [...] When the referee separated the pile, Wells was holding the ball and had crossed over the goal line. [...] E. A. Batchelor described the [...] "Niagara of sound" [...] that erupted from the stands:Venerable professors, giddy freshmen, staid, and usually phlegmatic, business men, small boys, pretty girls and even sweet faced old ladies stood up and howled until their vocal chords refused to emit <b>another</b> <b>sound.</b> [...] Down on the field the Michigan team, substitutes, coaches, band and everyone else who managed to pass the barriers and gain admittance to the inclosure [...] set aside for the elect, swarmed out on the battle ground, mingling in one wild, joyous, shouting, hugging, handshaking mob.|$|E
