50|$|The most {{preferred}} route shows {{a generally}} level route from Mbalam to Grand Batanga with one 100 km stretch of <b>falling</b> <b>gradients.</b> The gradients {{of such a}} route favours loaded trains.|$|R
50|$|Fall is mild {{with lower}} {{humidity}} and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall {{with the first}} freeze of the season on <b>average</b> <b>falling</b> on November 2 (the last on <b>average</b> <b>falls</b> on April 3); the first measurable (0.1 in) snow, often not counting flurries, on average occurs on December 4 (the last on <b>average</b> <b>falls</b> on March 17). Winters can be cold and snowy with temperatures frequently below freezing. Winter storm systems, such as Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, can bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets, and snowfall.|$|R
50|$|The {{double-track}} route required five tunnels in two miles; the longest, Union Street Tunnel is 710 yards (649 m) {{in length}} on a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> towards the Clyde of 1 in 70, with sharp curves at each end.|$|R
50|$|On 29 August 1891 a {{goods train}} of 24 wagons {{carrying}} stone from Britannia ran {{away on the}} <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1 in 34 (3%) and collided with a passenger train at Facit station. Three passengers died and six were injured.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 1871 the Rhymney Railway was at last able to {{open its}} own direct Caerphilly to Cardiff line. It had a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> {{all the way to}} Cardiff, where it made a {{junction}} with its own line to the Bute Docks. It was double track.|$|R

5000|$|On 16 March 1918 a {{goods train}} from Little Hulton [...] "ran away" [...] on the <b>falling</b> <b>gradients</b> towards Bolton. An alert {{signalman}} diverted it into Crook Street depot where it crashed through buffer stops, crossed cobbled land, crashed through a boundary wall {{and into the}} cellar of a house on Crook Street. The crew had jumped clear and, remarkably, no-one was hurt.|$|R
5000|$|Fairly saw his batting <b>average</b> <b>fall</b> to [...]257 in the 1971 season, however, {{his power}} numbers {{remained}} steady, as he hit 13 HR and 71 RBI in 146 games with Montreal.|$|R
50|$|The line {{followed}} a sinuous course {{to maintain a}} gentle <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> towards Plymouth: {{in a straight line}} the distance was 13 miles (21 km). The track gauge was 4 ft 6 in (1,372 mm) and the rails were bolted to cast iron chairs on stone blocks. The Leigham tunnel was 620 yards (567 m) long and there was one stone arch road bridge near Plym Bridge over the Roborough to Plympton road.|$|R
25|$|Autumn {{is similar}} to spring in temperature, with crisp mornings, and is a {{reasonably}} long transition, with the last + high of the year on <b>average</b> <b>falling</b> on September 10, and the first freeze at Reagan National occurring on November 18.|$|R
30|$|Among {{environmental}} factors, {{high traffic}} density, narrow lane width, high horizontal curve grade, rising and <b>falling</b> <b>gradients</b> and limited lateral clearance {{are related to}} increased incident rates (Oppenheim and Shinar 2012; Martens and Jenssen 2012). In particular rising and <b>falling</b> <b>gradients</b> is highlighted {{to increase the number}} of HGV and bus fires in Austria (Rattei et al. 2014). The area where the <b>gradient</b> goes from <b>falling</b> to rising is accident prone due to a likely abrupt change in speed (Martens and Jenssen 2012), which is also confirmed by Norwegian tunnel incident statistics (Nævestad and Meyer 2014). Tunnel entry portals have a high accident frequency, probably due to changing lighting conditions. The provision of traffic and safety information is necessary to improve driving behaviour and safety; but there is also a risk in providing too much information. In particular, information should be restricted 200  m before the tunnel entrance since then most drivers focus on the tunnel portal. It has been seen that many vehicles continue entering a tunnel even though traffic signals indicate the tunnel is closed, instead some kind of physical obstacle should be used (Martens and Jenssen 2012).|$|R
5000|$|From Leekbrook junction, Waterhouses {{station was}} [...] distant. The branch rose until it reached a summit of 1000 ft near [...] making {{that the highest}} point on the NSR. [...] From there the line fell to until Waterhouses was reached at an {{elevation}} of 725 ft. The descent necessitated a steep gradient of 1 in 40 (2.5%) that ended {{only at the end}} of the station platform. [...] The station itself was on a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1 in 260 (0.38%).|$|R
5000|$|This area {{is located}} between the Chenab and Ravi rivers.

50|$|The {{first eight}} wagons were {{equipped}} with the vacuum brake but the pipes had not been connected. The train had run from Ellesmere Port as an unbraked freight train and stopped at Helsby, where it needed to reverse. The guard had forgotten to connect the vacuum pipes when the locomotive coupled up to {{the opposite end of}} the train, so that extra brake power was not available on the <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> into Chester. The driver had also omitted to carry out a brake test before departure.|$|R

50|$|From Yatton {{the line}} ran {{more or less}} level at first, then {{climbing}} to Shute Shelve Tunnel at 1 in 90, falling {{on the other side}} at 1 in 75. Gentle undulations followed to a summit between Lodge Hill and Wookey, climbing at 1 in 96. A slight fall followed to Wells. Leaving Wells the line climbed for over 6 miles to Dulcote at 1 in 46½ for much of the distance. The <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> the other side had a ruling gradient of 1 in 47, although with some short sections of gentler climb.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR built a {{connecting}} line that descended to St Davids station by a steep <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> at 1 in 37 (2.7%). The authorising Act required the Bristol and Exeter Railway to lay narrow gauge rails {{as far as}} Cowley Bridge Junction, a short distance north of St Davids where the North Devon line diverged. Under the terms of this concession, all LSWR passenger trains were required to make calls at St Davids station. LSWR trains to London ran south through St Davids station, while broad gauge trains to London ran northwards.|$|R
50|$|Waterfall was a town {{created by}} rail workers, {{who built the}} line from Sydney to Wollongong in the late 19th century. It is the highest point on the line, with a steep rising {{gradient}} at one end, and a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> at the other end, and sidings were provided in both directions to allow freight wagons to be stowed and shunted. Waterfall derived {{its name from the}} waterfalls close to the railway station. McKell Avenue, the southern border of the Royal National Park, was originally called Waterfall Road.|$|R
5000|$|Colbren Junction station, {{which opened}} in 1873 {{at the same time}} as the new route, was {{situated}} at the point where the original Neath and Brecon line met the new branch to Ynys-y-Geinon. The station consisted of three separate side platforms. As the Neath line was on a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient,</b> while the branch rose before commencing the descent to the Tawe valley, the branch's two platforms were built at a higher level to the single Neath side platform. Access between the upper and lower central platforms was by a short flight of steps.|$|R
5000|$|The city of Liverpool {{is built}} on an {{escarpment}}. Edge Hill stands on the ridge {{to the east of}} the city. The escarpment falls down to the River Mersey. The Victoria Tunnel followed a western course downwards on a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> of 1:57 to the river. The lowest point is at the Byrom Street cutting. The tunnel continues towards the Waterloo Dock with the much shorter Waterloo Tunnel. The tunnel rises upwards from this point with rising gradients of 1:513 for , 1:139 for [...] and finally 1:86 for [...] to the western Waterloo Dock portal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{route of}} the branch {{commenced}} {{on the north side}} of the level crossing in Grimsargh and curved sharply westward on a <b>falling</b> <b>gradient</b> into the deep cutting and on to the embankment before crossing Brabiner Lane.
