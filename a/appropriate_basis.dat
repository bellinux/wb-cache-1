2500|$|Numerous books, special collections, and journal {{articles}} on E.P. Thompson's scholarly work and legacy appeared {{soon after his}} death in 1993. Since then, however, interest in Thompson has waned. The reasons for this are perhaps easily enough summarized. Today, Thompson's histories are viewed as old-fashioned, while his socialist politics are believed extinct. [...] Class is considered neither a fruitful concept of historical analysis nor an <b>appropriate</b> <b>basis</b> for an emancipatory politics. [...] Nuclear weapons proliferate, but no anti-nuclear movement grows up alongside their proliferation. Civil liberties are a minority, and increasingly [...] "radical," [...] interest {{in the age of the}} [...] "war on terror." [...] Internationalism, as ideology and practice, is the preserve of capital not labour. [...] At the beginning of the twenty-first century, then, Thompson seems out of place.|$|E
60|$|A mere {{village has}} no {{claim to a}} {{municipal}} representation. By a village I mean a place whose inhabitants are not markedly distinguished by occupation or social relations {{from those of the}} rural districts adjoining, and for whose local wants the arrangements made for the surrounding territory will suffice. Such small places have rarely a sufficient public to furnish a tolerable municipal council: if they contain any talent or knowledge applicable to public business, it is apt to be all concentrated in some one man, who thereby becomes the dominator of the place. It is better that such places should be merged in a larger circumscription. The local representation of rural districts will naturally be determined by geographical considerations, with due regard to those sympathies of feeling by which human beings are so much aided to act in concert, and which partly follow historical boundaries, such as those of counties or provinces, and partly community of interest and occupation, as in agriculture, maritime, manufacturing, or mining districts. Different kinds of local business require different areas of representation. The Unions of parishes have been fixed on as the most <b>appropriate</b> <b>basis</b> for the representative bodies which superintend the relief of indigence; while, for the proper regulation of highways, or prisons, or police, a large extent, like that of an average county, is not more than sufficient. In these large districts, therefore, the maxim, that an elective body constituted in any locality should have authority over all the local concerns common to the locality, requires modification from another principle, {{as well as from the}} competing consideration of the importance of obtaining for the discharge of the local duties the highest qualifications possible. For example, if it be necessary (as I believe it to be) for the proper administration of the poor-laws that the area of rating should not be more extensive than most of the present Unions, a principle which requires a Board of Guardians for each Union, yet, as a much more highly qualified class of persons is likely to be obtainable for a County Board than those who compose an average Board of Guardians, it may, on that ground, be expedient to reserve for the County Boards some higher descriptions of local business, which might otherwise have been conveniently managed within itself by each separate Union.|$|E

50|$|Curvelets are an <b>appropriate</b> <b>basis</b> for {{representing}} images (or other functions) {{which are}} smooth apart from singularities along smooth curves, where the curves have bounded curvature, i.e. where {{objects in the}} image have a minimum length scale. This property holds for cartoons, geometrical diagrams, and text. As one zooms in on such images, the edges they contain appear increasingly straight. Curvelets {{take advantage of this}} property, by defining the higher resolution curvelets to be more elongated than the lower resolution curvelets. However, natural images (photographs) do not have this property; they have detail at every scale. Therefore, for natural images, it is preferable to use some sort of directional wavelet transform whose wavelets have the same aspect ratio at every scale.|$|E
