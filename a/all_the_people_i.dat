25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E

2500|$|On March 23, Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, {{the members}} of Elvis's band, visited Perkins {{on their way to}} New York to appear with Presley the next day. Fontana {{recalled}} Perkins saying, [...] "Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>I</b> looked up and there you guys are. You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me." [...] Black told him, [...] "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", and lit a cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Perkins was given a telegram from Presley (which had arrived on March 23), wishing him a speedy recovery.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, Nazi German {{occupation}} forces {{closed the}} university after invading Poland. Able-bodied males {{were required to}} work, so from 1940 to 1944 Wojtyła variously worked as a messenger for a restaurant, a manual labourer in a limestone quarry and for the Solvay chemical factory, to avoid deportation to Germany. In 1940 {{he was struck by}} a tram, suffering a fractured skull. [...] The same year he was hit by a lorry in a quarry, which left him with one shoulder higher than the other and a permanent stoop. His father, a former Austro-Hungarian non-commissioned officer and later officer in the Polish Army, {{died of a heart attack}} in 1941, leaving Wojtyła as the immediate family's only surviving member. [...] "I was not at my mother's death, I was not at my brother's death, I was not at my father's death," [...] he said, reflecting on these times of his life, nearly forty years later, [...] "At twenty, I had already lost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> loved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14. 'This song is just, I suppose, about how much we miss him'.|$|E
