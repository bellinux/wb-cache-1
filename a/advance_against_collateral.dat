He argues that [...] "money matters" [...] and quoting Walter Bagehot [...] "money is economical power" [...] states that [...] "the money at the core of modern economies is central bank money, what bankers call ‘liquidity’. Central banks inject money into the economy, using banks as intermediaries, <b>against</b> <b>collateral.</b> So, if money is economic power and money is issued <b>against</b> <b>collateral,</b> {{it is important to understand}} the nature of this collateral, and the terms of the exchange." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} reform process has given banks in India {{a great deal}} of freedom on both the assets and liabilities (or sources and uses of funds) sides of their balance sheets. To the extent that, financial liberalization has opened up new non-reservable and non-insured sources of funds (like Certificates of Deposits and new issue of equity), any attempts by the central bank to influence bank lending by withdrawing reserves (leading to a fall in deposits) from the banking system could be countered by raising money from these alternate sources leaving bank lending unchanged. It is in this liberalized regime that the ’bank lending channel’, which emphasizes the presence of asymmetric information in the financial markets, becomes particularly relevant. In this article we attempt to verify if bank lending is constrained by the availability of insured deposits and whether there exist subgroups of banks that are less constrained. We find that banks in general are constrained in their lending by the availability of insured deposits and these constraints are more severe for those banks that lend predominantly <b>against</b> <b>collateral.</b> In India more than 85 per cent of bank lending is <b>against</b> <b>collateral.</b> This implies a potentially important influence of the bank lending channel...|$|R

40|$|Many assets {{derive their}} value {{not only from}} future cash flows but also from their ability to serve as collateral. In this paper, we {{investigate}} this collateral premium {{and its impact on}} asset returns in an infinite-horizon general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents facing col- lateral constraints for borrowing. We document that borrowing <b>against</b> <b>collateral</b> substantially increases the return volatility of long-lived assets. Moreover, otherwise identical assets with different degrees of collateralizability exhibit substantially different return dynamics because their prices contain a sizable collateral premium that varies over time. This premium can be positive even for assets that never pay dividends...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} {{a theory of}} credit-driven asset bubbles which are neutral in their real effects. When a lender such as a government, central bank, or banking sector is willing to lend {{infinitely}} <b>against</b> <b>collateral,</b> explosive asset bubbles can form which exactly offset a bubble in household liabilities. Surprisingly, evidence from a VAR using long-run restrictions supports the idea that asset bubbles are approximately neutral in their real effects before 2007. The evidence becomes more ambiguous if one includes post- 2007 data, hinting that the post- 2007 degree of comovement between asset prices and output comes from an unusual regime...|$|R
