500|$|The {{decision}} did {{not rule}} the membership clause unconstitutional. In their concurring opinions, Justices Black and Douglas argued that the membership clause of the Smith Act was unconstitutional on its face {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment, with Douglas writing that [...] "the utterances, attitudes, and associations in this case... <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view, wholly protected by the First Amendment, and not subject to inquiry, examination, or prosecution by the Federal Government." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan was {{rethinking}} {{the direction of}} his life while recovering from a sense of having been exploited. Nine months after the crash, he told New York Daily News reporter Michael Iachetta, [...] "Songs <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head like they always are. And they're not going to get written down until some things are evened up. Not until some people come forth and make up for {{some of the things that}} have happened." [...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had to come to terms with his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E

500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there, I was delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

[...] He went on to collaborate on three more Nine Inch Nails records, including follow-up The Fragile (1999), the instrumental, independently released Ghosts I–IV (2008) and more recent Hesitation Marks (2013).|$|E

2500|$|In reply, Eminescu stated that, {{regardless}} of the Slavic suffix in Eminovici, his own lineage was Moldavian and aristocratic. Author and psychologist [...] Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: [...] "The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But {{who do you think}} you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, to give yourself such superior airs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983 Pride was released, which, {{while not}} as commercially {{successful}} as Clues, did feature the title song and Palmer's cover of The System's [...] "You <b>Are</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> System", with The System's David Frank contributing keyboard tracks {{to the latter}} song. On 31 May 1983, Palmer's concert at the Hammersmith Palais was recorded and broadcast on BBC Radio 1. On 23 July 1983, Palmer performed at Duran Duran's charity concert at Aston Villa football ground where he struck up friendships with members of Duran Duran which would spawn the supergroup the Power Station.|$|E
2500|$|In a Vulture interview, Shyamalan {{argued that}} his style and art-form of {{storytelling}} {{resulted in the}} negative reviews of the film and compared it to asking a painter to change to a different style: [...] "I bring as much integrity to the table as humanly possible. It must be a language thing, {{in terms of a}} particular accent, a storytelling accent. I can only see it this certain way and I don't know how to think in another language. I think these are exactly the visions that <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head, so I don't know how to adjust it without being me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Li Chun {{was born}} in 778, {{during the reign of}} his {{great-grandfather}} Emperor Daizong, at the Eastern Palace (i.e., the palace of his grandfather, then-Crown Prince Li Kuo). [...] His father Li Song was Li Kuo's oldest son, and he himself was Li Song's oldest son. [...] His mother was Li Song's concubine Consort Wang. [...] When Li Chun was five or six, by which time Li Kuo was emperor (as Emperor Dezong), there was an occasion when Emperor Dezong held Li Chun on his lap and asked, [...] "Who are you, such that you <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lap?" [...] His response of, [...] "I am the third Son of Heaven" [...] surprised Emperor Dezong, who thereafter showed him much favor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1876, Anna {{visited the}} Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where she saw {{an exhibit of}} {{educational}} blocks created by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel. The blocks, known as Froebel Gifts, were the foundation of his innovative kindergarten curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: [...] "For several years I sat at the little Kindergarten table-top… and played… with the cube, the sphere and the triangle—these smooth wooden maple blocks… All <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> fingers to this day… [...] " [...] Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.|$|E
2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} ignored {{advice from}} him and Saudi foreign minister Saud Al Faisal against invading Iraq. However, other sources said that many Arab governments were only nominally opposed to the Iraq invasion because of popular hostility. Before becoming king, Prince Abdullah {{was thought to be}} completely against the US invasion of Iraq; this, however, was not the case. Riyadh provided essential support to the United States during the war and proved that [...] "necessity does lead to some accommodations from time to time". The King expressed a complete lack of trust in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki and held out little hope for improved Saudi-Iraqi relations as long as al-Maliki remained in office. King Abdullah told an Iraqi official about Al Maliki, [...] "You and Iraq <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, but that man is not." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to recreating recorded sounds {{by placing the}} stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating {{it in the same}} direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards. In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, [...] "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way". The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist Aleister Crowley, who suggested in his 1913 book Magick (Book 4) that an adept [...] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to [...] "listen to phonograph records, reversed". In the movie Gold Diggers of 1935, the end of the dancing pianos musical number [...] "The Words <b>Are</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] is filmed in reverse motion with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed.|$|E
2500|$|While {{some people}} feel {{economic}} rights ought to be included, jurisprudence in this area appears not to support this view. In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that [...] "The ability to generate business revenue by one's chosen means is not a right that is protected under s. 7 of the Charter." [...] In 2004, Justice Blair, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mussani v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario noted that [...] "the weight of authority {{is that there is}} no constitutional right to practise a profession unfettered by the applicable rules which and standards which regulate that profession", before going on to conclude that the revocation of Mr. Mussani's licence to practice medicine did not deprive him of life, liberty, or the security of his person. The courts have also held that [...] "salary or compensation (in whatever form they may take), <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view a purely economic right, and are not protected by section 7." ...|$|E

Norma demands that he forever shun Adalgisa; only then will she release him and never see him again. He refuses, and she vents her anger by telling him that she will then kill her children. [...] "Strike me instead", he demands, [...] "so that only I alone will die", but she quickly asserts that not only will all the Romans die, but so will Adalgisa, who has broken her vows as a priestess. This prompts him to plead for her life. (Cabaletta: Norma and Pollione: Già mi pasco ne' tuoi sguardi / [...] "Already I take {{pleasure}} in the look you give me, your grief and in her death; at last I can make you as miserable as I".) When Pollione demands the knife, she calls the priests to assemble. Norma announces {{that it would be}} better to sacrifice a priestess who has broken her vows, and orders the pyre to be lit. Oroveso demands to know who is to be sacrificed while Pollione demands that she keep silent, but Norma then reveals that it is she who is to be the victim because she is the guilty one, a high Priestess who has broken her vows, has become involved with the enemy, and has borne his children. (Aria, Norma to Pollione: Qual cor tradisti / [...] "May this awful moment now show you the heart you betrayed and lost"; Duet: Norma and Pollione; Ensemble, Norma, Oroveso, Pollione, Druids, Priests: each expresses his/her sorrow, anger, pleas to Norma, with Oroveso learning for the first time that Norma is a mother.) ...|$|E
