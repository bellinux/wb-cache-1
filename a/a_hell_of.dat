25|$|Thompson's writing {{culminated in}} {{a few of his}} best-regarded works: The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, <b>A</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> a Woman and Pop. 1280. In these works, Thompson became one of the writers who turned the derided crime genre into {{literature}} and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books became popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> a Woman {{was also}} adapted in French as Série noire (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges Pérec. This noir {{masterpiece}} {{set in the}} grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, {{as well as what}} is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a lot of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer Inside Me, Savage Night, <b>A</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>of</b> a Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E

500|$|Hundreds {{of musicians}} have been {{inspired}} by the album. Pianist Lafayette Gilchrist states that Money Jungle was the first jazz album that he bought, and that it [...] "sounds like an orchestra being played by a trio. I was inspired to make something [...] big and grandiose just like that". Drummer Jeff [...] "Tain" [...] Watts observed that the members of the trio were [...] "doing their thing, but they’re together", and compares this with later groups led by Keith Jarrett and Wayne Shorter, stating that the later groups [...] "have a much freer way of doing it, but everybody's kind of in their own zone and yet they’re [...] definitely [...] playing [...] the [...] composition in tune with each other, just like Duke and Max and Mingus were doing on Money Jungle." [...] Trumpeter Miles Davis had a different view of the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test, he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that [...] "Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a bass player, and Max is <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke." ...|$|E
