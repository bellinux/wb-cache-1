40|$|The Judicial Conference of the United States {{is charged}} with “carry[ing] on a {{continuous}} study of the operation and effect” of the national rules of court procedure promulgated under the Rules Enabling Act. The cycle of rulemaking regularly produces amendments that supersede or abrogate rules. Do the now-dead versions of a rule have any continuing significance? Sometimes a prior practice lives on, despite {{the adoption of a}} rule designed specifically to supplant it. This Piece takes as an example the persistence, in a particular federal circuit, of the practice of dismissing a civil appeal rather than staying it pending the disposition of postjudgment motions. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4 (a) (4) used to require such dismissals, but since 1993 the Rule has mandated the opposite. This Piece designates the pre- 1993 Rule 4 (a) (4) a “phantom rule” and argues that the phantom in question should be exorcised because the old version of the rule conflicts with the text and purpose of current law. The Piece notes, however, that not all such phantoms are equally undesirable. Now-abrogated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 84 and the old <b>Appendix</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forms</b> provide examples of no-longer-extant rules that may continue to tell us something about the meaning of current law...|$|E
40|$|This project empirically explores civil {{litigation}} {{from its}} inception by examining the content of civil complaints. We utilize spectral cluster analysis on a newly compiled federal district court data set of causes of action in complaints to illustrate the relationship of legal claims to one another, the broader composition of lawsuits in trial courts, and the breadth of pleading in individual complaints. Our results shed light {{not only on the}} networks of legal theories in civil litigation but also on how lawsuits are classified and the strategies that plaintiffs and their attorneys employ when commencing litigation. This approach permits us to lay the foundation for a more precise and useful taxonomy of federal litigation than has been previously available, one that, after the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009), has also arguably never been more relevant than it is today. The idea of “a plain and short statement of the claim ” has not caught on. Few complaints follow the models in the <b>Appendix</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forms.</b> Plaintiffs ’ lawyers, knowing that some judges read a complaint as soon as it is filed {{in order to get a}} sense of the suit, hope by pleading facts to “educate ” (that is to say, influence) the judge with regard to the nature and probable merits of th...|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has not been kind to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the Rules). From the growth of summary {{judgment}} as a mechanism to let judges instead of juries determine facts, to the love–hate relationship with class actions, judicial interpretations of the Rules have revealed a trend toward complicating the ability of plaintiffs to find redress for their claims. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the shifting standards of pleading requirements under Rule 8. Much has been written by academics and practitioners alike regarding the ripples caused by Twombly and Iqbal. Although the Court {{would like to believe}} otherwise, would-be plaintiffs are faced with a greater pleading standard than the plain language of Rule 8 suggests. Now, a new victim of judicial misinterpretation has emerged: the <b>Appendix</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forms</b> under Rule 84. Part I of this Note discusses the history of Twombly and Iqbal and their effect on pleading standards under the Rules. Part II describes how courts have struggled, unsuccessfully in many cases, to reconcile the Court’s interpretation with the language of Rule 8 and the illustrative forms under Rule 84. Part III outlines the response of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure to the dilemma created by Twombly and Iqbal. Finally, Part IV discusses the author’s alternative to abrogation of the Forms...|$|E
40|$|Most {{scholars}} {{mark the}} end of notice pleading in federal civil cases {{at the time of the}} Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly or, at the latest, at the Court’s 2009 decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal. Scholars have noted occasional departures from the notice pleading standard in more complex civil cases, but notice pleading has been thought to remain the prevalent practice in simple negligence cases. This Article examines two sets of complaints filed in federal district courts in 2006 in cases alleging injuries from simple automobile accidents. We find that notice pleading practice, as indicated by Form 11 in the <b>Appendix</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forms</b> that accompany the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, had already been abandoned in these routine cases before Twombly in favor of narrative pleading that provides a fuller expression of the factual context of the claim. If pleading practice did not follow the notice pleading standard before Twombly in simple negligence cases that had the benefit of specific Form 11 guidance, it is doubtful that attorneys adhered to notice pleading practice in other more complex federal civil cases. In this regard, our findings also raise doubts about the utility of Form 11. In discussing our findings, we also briefly explore the psychology of pleading and whether the emergence of narrative pleading was an unintended consequence of a series of amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure starting in the mid- 1980 s and intended to allow more effective judicial management of litigation. While the Twombly/Iqbal plausibility standard certainly presents a higher standard than notice pleading, the trend is clear: pleading additional facts beyond the requirements of notice pleading predated Twombly or Iqbal and lower courts had already started to abandon the notice pleading standard...|$|E
40|$|On December 1, 2015, {{amendments}} to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure took effect. The changes included, among other things, the abrogation of the <b>Appendix</b> <b>of</b> <b>Forms,</b> which contained templates for summons, complaints, answers, and other litigation documents. Prior to its abrogation, Form 18 —a template for a “Complaint for Patent Infringement”—was widely utilized by patent plaintiffs in crafting infringement complaints. Form 18 was created during the Conley pleading regime, when conclusory allegations were generally sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the sample allegations in Form 18 were conclusory and bare-bones in nature. Under Conley, plaintiffs who followed this template almost always survived motions to dismiss. In 2007, the Supreme Court announced a heightened pleading standard in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, and in 2009, it clarified that the new standard applied to all federal civil cases. Under the new standard, conclusory allegations alone are not sufficient, and complaints must be plausible on their face. Despite clear direction from the Supreme Court that the new “plausibility” standard applied to all cases, the Federal Circuit and many district courts continued to allow patent infringement plaintiffs to use Form 18 ’s conclusory language. With the elimination of Form 18 from the Federal Rules, courts are now unquestionably bound to apply the plausibility standard to patent infringement pleadings. Under the plausibility standard, plaintiffs will likely be required to identify the patent claims they believe are infringed. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} patent and the defendant’s business, plaintiffs may also be required to identify the accused product by name or model number. Finally, to move a claim across the line from conceivable to plausible, plaintiffs may need to allege that each claim limitation has a corresponding element in the accused product. The Northern District of California’s Patent Local Rules would serve as a close approximation of the approach outlined here. These heightened requirements will reduce frivolous pleadings, decrease discovery costs, and encourage early settlement in competitor cases...|$|E
