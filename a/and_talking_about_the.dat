Pablo Helman, who previously worked on , was the visual effects supervisor for the Industrial Light and Magic team on the film. He worked closely with Shyamalan, reviewing each scene <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> visual effects needed to tell the story, and ultimately worked with about 300 people to reflect the director's vision, who he said planned it all in a story-board book.|$|E

"The filming {{process was}} an {{efficient}} one, {{and it was}} going so well {{that in the middle}} of the production Cukor asked Hepburn to talk to Judy Garland in an attempt to convince Garland of the need to sober up. In order to add realism to the production, Cukor consulted reporters from United Press for advice on how newspapermen would handle Forrest's funeral. Based on their critiques, Cukor changed the scene in the village hotel's bar so that instead of drinking <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> funeral, the reporters get to work drafting articles on their typewriters. The script, too, was changed to permit the bartender to make a quip about reporters working rather than drinking.|$|E

Regarding the filming of the video, she stated, [...] "Sometimes the director or production assistants had to say like, 'OK, girls, bring it back home. Bring it back together because when we were together, we go back to how we were when we were younger, just always laughing and talking about things. It's been a great moment." [...] The video was released on Williams' Vevo account the same day. A behind-the-scenes footage was also released featuring the trio on set <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song and their reunion.

Captured by two Torchwood agents—Alice Guppy (Amy Manson) and Emily Holroyd (Heather Craney)-Jack was subjected to torture and interrogation regarding the Doctor before being put to work for the Institute as a freelance agent for over a century. A few years later (1901), whilst this Harkness was in Torchwood's employ, Guppy and Charles Gaskell (Cornelius Macarthy) found and disinterred another Harkness on a different timeline, who instructs them to immediately [...] "cryofreeze" [...] and store him for 107 years to avoid him meeting his other self – they comply with his request.|$|E

2500|$|Crying is {{a normal}} and natural part of grieving. It has also been found, however, that crying <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss {{is not the only}} healthy {{response}} and, if forced or excessive, can be harmful. Responses or actions in the affected person, called [...] "coping ugly" [...] by researcher George Bonanno, may seem counter-intuitive or even appear dysfunctional, e.g., celebratory responses, laughter, or self-serving bias in interpreting events. Lack of crying is also a natural, healthy reaction, potentially protective of the individual, and may also be seen as a sign of resilience. Science has found that some healthy people who are grieving do not spontaneously talk about the loss. Pressing people to cry or retell the experience of a loss can be harmful. Genuine laughter is healthy.|$|E
2500|$|One of the band's most {{striking}} aspects is B-Real's exaggeratedly high-pitched nasal vocals. In the book Check the Technique, B-Real describes his nasal style, saying his rapping voice is [...] "high and annoying... the nasal style I have {{was just something}} that I developed... my more natural style wasn't so pleasing to DJ Muggs and Sen Dog's ears" [...] <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> nasal style in the book How to Rap, B-Real says, [...] "you want to {{stand out from the}} others and just be distinct... when you got something that can separate you from everybody else, you gotta use it to your advantage." [...] In the film Art of Rap, B-Real credits the Beastie Boys as an influence when developing his rapping style. Sen Dog's voice is deeper, more violent and often shouted alongside the rapping; his vocals are often emphasized by adding another background/choir voice to say them. Sen Dog's style is in contrast to B-Real's, who says, [...] "Sen's voice is so strong," [...] and [...] "it all blends together" [...] when they are both on the same track.|$|E
2500|$|In 1833, Solomos {{wrote his}} first {{important}} work during his maturity, O Kritikos (The Cretan), in iambic fifteen-syllable verse, {{as a result}} of the Cretan's literature influence. [...] The work describes the story of a Cretan who left from Crete after the revolution was lost in 1826, the shipwreck and his efforts to save his beloved from the tempest. [...] A central point in the work is the apparition of an oracle, the Feggarontymeni (meaning the one dressed by the moon). [...] The narrator of the story is the Cretan himself: he starts telling his story many years later, when he is living alone as a beggar, doing flashbacks (from his life on Crete and the shipwreck) <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future (the resurrection of the dead and his encounter with his beloved one in Paradise). [...] O Kritikos is aesthetically the most complete poem. [...] There is juxtaposition of storm imagery and the pursuit by the Turks. The problem troubling language specialists is the interpretation of the Feggarontymeni's figure. Some think the figure is an allusion to the Virgin Mary. She is described as the 'goddess' and reads in his heart the story of his heroic and ultimately futile struggles against the Turks in his native island which all but charms him out of his mortal body. David Ricks writes with respect to her identity, [...] "we must hold in balance the soul of the expiring fiancée, the kindly presence of the Motherland and a recollection of our Lady".|$|E
