40|$|This report {{documents}} <b>a</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> at Scania CV AB in Södertälje, Sweden. The {{main purpose}} of the thesis has been to examine and improve upon current practices of parametric CAD-modeling at Scania, with {{the ultimate goal of}} increased design automation and simulation-driven design. The thesis was initiated with a literature study, mainly covering the fields of parametric CAD-modeling, design automation and knowledge-based engineering. Furthermore, a questionnaire and multiple interviews were conducted to assess the awareness and mind-set of the employees. Finally, a case-study was carried out to follow current methodologies, and address any deficiencies found. Some of the most important findings were that while parametric modeling has considerable potential in enabling design automation, it is crucial, and most beneficial in terms of automation efficiency, to start with the fundamentals, namely achieving a uniform modeling practice. With these findings, a new proposed methodology has been introduced, as well as a recommended plan for a widespread implementation of parametric modeling at Scania. Such implementation would allow for shorter lead-times, faster adaptation to changing conditions, and reduced development expenditures...|$|E

The current study was done on the same university campus, 27 years later. A main interest of the investigator is in finding out if the previous findings still hold today. The current study will then expand on the original research by examining whether men???s attitudes towards female sex role stereotypes in our society significantly differ from women???s and in addition, whether men???s attitude towards women affects their career choice. A sample of 120 undergraduate students were administered the Attitude Towards Women scale (AWS). The original study (Copland, 1978) found that attitudes towards women???s social sex-roles were not related to career choice. It was hypothesized in this study that students??? attitude towards women as measured by the AWS would be different among students in traditional and non-traditional majors. The results of this study did not support this hypothesis. It was further hypothesized that differences in attitudes towards women would be found between men and women. The results of this study did support this hypothesis. In addition, a significant interaction was found between sex and major choice such that when considered together, they had a significant effect on students??? attitude towards women...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of <b>a</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> at the {{consulting}} firm Bjerking AB andis the final part of the Bachelor Programme in Construction Engineering at Universityof Uppsala. The work aims to investigate the costs and how the choice of ventilationsystem affects building projects during a long-term period. This report covers costssuch as investment, maintenance and energy but also how they affect residents andbuilders. Building regulations for energy consumption are expected to be tougher;therefore a comparison of two different heat recovery ventilation systems(HRV-system) was made. One system is based on a centrally placed unit that coversthe whole buildings ventilation through vertical shafts. The second system is based onapartment placed unit that only covers the individual apartment’s ventilation. The unitmakes it possible for the individual user to control the ventilation flow. The method used for comparison of the costs was Life Cycle Cost (LCC). It results inthe total cost during a selected calculation period of 20 years, where yearly basedcosts as energy and maintenance is included. Two housing projects in central Uppsalawere chosen as a reference. They were similar in design but with the two differentsystems of ventilation. A questionnaire was handed out to provide experience fromresidents with apartment units. The results were used in the analysis of the systemsand to determine its pros and cons. Information of costs was collected from different companies and resulted intocustomized spreadsheets to determine the cost per apartment. The result shows thatthe difference in investment is not significant between the systems but is big inmaintenance and energy. The biggest difference is maintenance where the apartmentsystems many service points is increasing the cost. Energy consumption for theapartment system leads to higher energy costs than with a central system, even if thecontrol function is used. The explanation is that a central systems fans have lowerpower usage and the heat recovery is more efficient then an apartment system. The conclusion is that a central system has a lower total cost compared to anapartment system during the calculation period. A reason for choosing the apartmentsystem would be if a need to maximize living space is a priority, and the developingphase of the project is well thought thru.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research study is to investigate how the tax rules and regulations applicable to agriculture affect the optimality for agriculture decision making. The study examines such issues as how the cash method of accounting affects the optimal timing for economic transactions, how the opportunity to convert ordinary tax deductions into long-term capital gains affect the optimal strategy for choosing raised pigs for breeding purposes and how the alternative minimum income tax rules restrict the benefits of designated tax rules and regulations. This examination also provides insights as to what types of accounting information is needed to support the agriculture decision making process. ^ The research study uses the principles of Multiperiod Linear Programming to construct a series of decision models for this investigation. These decision models allow revenue to be earned from either a corn or hog production operation. The statistical data {{used for this study}} are provided by <b>a</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> by Neal Stanley and statistics maintained by the Agriculture Extension Services at the University of Nebraska. The various decision models are used to examine how (1) the initial state, (2) the use of expected values, (3) inflation, (4) the assumptions for computing borrowing capacity, and (5) the choice of objective functions affect the optimality for agricultural decision making. ^ The solutions for the various decision models demonstrate that the tax law introduces biases which can modify the optimality for agriculture decision making, that deferred taxes are a source of capital for conducting agriculture operations, and that the alternative minimum income tax rules restrict the benefits provided by specific tax rules. The manner in which these various tax rules affect the optimality of decision making depends upon the non-tax parameter for the decision making process. The interaction between the tax and non-tax parameters introduces interperiod dependency for the decision making process. Moreover, the tax law also introduces interdependency between decisions which would not exist except for the tax law. These findings suggest that the tax law creates a need to use mathematical tools which allow the consideration of various decisions at various points of time simultaneously. Thus, the development of multi-period linear programming may improve the relevance and reliability of accounting information. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} decade, {{numerous}} books of business thinking and innovation management were published announcing {{the advent of}} a new economy of sharing (Tapscott & Williams, 2006), the openness of innovation processes (Chesbrough, 2003 a, 2003 b), the increasingly wide participation of customers to New Product Developement processes (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004; Howe, 2006). According to Chesbrough for example, a new era has already begun : « the era of Open Innovation » (Chesbrough, 2003 b). Nevertheless, a literature review of these best-sellers works demonstrates that many of the examples used by the business thinkers are common to the diverse publications. Moreover, a broader study on a 1500 articles corpus extracted from Business Source Complete — around the “co-innovation” theme — shows that the companies from the primary and secondary sectors are almost absent from the case studies. So it’s important to put borders to the understanding of a phenomenon which is too often immediately perceived as global in the literature even if the practices seem far more sector-specific. This paper will be based on <b>a</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> between 2010 and 2015 on the participatory innovation in firm-hosted online communities. We will use the data collected on six web platforms launched by five companies between 2004 and 2008 : Ideastorm (Dell), Lab'Orange and dream Orange (Orange), L’Atelier SFR (SFR) and La Fabrique RATP (RATP), Imagine TGV (SNCF). These data come from both interviews and online social networks analysis. We will first propose a typology of participatory innovation systems implemented by companies since {{the second half of the}} 2000 s, in the wake of this evolution of the Web towards more interactive formats —and potentially participative— the so-called Web 2. 0. We will distinguish the platforms open to the general public from new R&D intermediation platforms — such as InnoCentive, Nine Sigma, YourEncore, etc. — in which the innovation process is still controlled by experts. Having thus defined the scope of our study to large companies dedicated to participatory innovation with end-users, we will build our argument in two stages. First, we’ll describe the platforms as socio-technical devices made of software and organizational choices that make up, combined with the different uses from company's spokesmen and users, a “reference frame” (Flichy, 1995) for the co-innovation. Next, we will show by using our interviews and online observations, that we can distinguish three different engagement plans (“régimes d’engagement”) (Thevenot, 2006) in the online collaboration : the lead-user, the fan and the activist. This communication thus enters the first thematic focus of the conference (Practices and sociotechnical devices), since it proposes on the one hand a typology and a socio-technical analysis of co-innovation devices based on an interactionist approach to participation and on the other hand a pragmatic analysis of user involvement in collaboration with companies...|$|E

40|$|This project, Streaming Legitimacy, is <b>a</b> master <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> by two Music Management {{students}} from the University of Agder. The background for this thesis {{is rooted in the}} current debates surrounding fair distribution of revenues in the music streaming industry. Some of the focus in this debate concerns the revenue distribution models of the streaming services. The focus has previously been on the different models effect on the distribution of revenues to the rights holders. For us, the lack of focus on the consumers’ perception on this matter has led us to the following research questions: How will consumers perceive a user-centric distribution model? Will it affect consumer behaviour? If so, how and to what extent will it affect consumer behaviour? In the approach of these questions, we apply a qualitative methodology. This thesis falls within the field of consumer research with an interpretivist approach.

40|$|This is <b>a</b> master <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> {{during the}} autumn and winter 2010 - 2011 at KTH Centre for Naval Architecture in {{collaboration}} with Wallenius Marine AB. Traditionally the hull lines of typical Pure Car and Truck Carriers have been optimized for minimum resistance when going on a straight path and for maximum cargo capacity. This has resulted in vessels with slender underwater body, very high vertical centre of gravity and large flares in the waterlines of the aft body to provide form stability. Dynamic behaviour, such as manoeuvrability, has not been in main focus while designing the hulls. To create a tool for assessing the manoeuvrability, a model describing the motions in four degrees of freedom of a vessel have been developed. The equations of motion in surge, sway, yaw and roll are set up and solved numerically in Matlab. The code has been validated against available benchmark results and calibrated using trial data {{from a number of}} vessels from the Wallenius fleet. Good compliance to trial results is achieved for the initial part of a turn but some problems occur in the later part. Both trials and simulations indicate on very good turning and yaw checking abilities among the investigated vessels but also a tendency of dynamic instability...|$|R

This study is based on <b>a</b> <b>thesis</b> project <b>conducted</b> as part of the author’s master’s in public health coursework and is considered a systematized review. Methods: Four databases were searched for English-language articles published between 2005 and 2015 : PubMed, Web of Science, Library Literature & Information Science Index, and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA). Studies were excluded if there was no primary data collection, the population in the study was not identified as public health workers, “information” was not defined according to specific criteria, or evidence-based information and public health workers were not the major focus. Studies included in the final analysis underwent data extraction, critical appraisal using CASP and STROBE checklists, and thematic analysis. Results: Thirty-three research studies were identified in the search, including twenty-one using quantitative methods and twelve using qualitative methods. Critical appraisal revealed many potential biases, particularly in the validity of research. Thematic analysis revealed five common themes: (1) definition of information needs, (2) current information-seeking behavior and use, (3) definition of evidence-based information, (4) barriers to information needs, and (5) public health–specific issues. Conclusions: Recommendations are given for how librarians can increase the use of evidence-based information in public health research, practice, and policy making.

The purpose of this project was to design interface templates for three different application types for Windows Phone: a RSS-reader, a school application and a news application and to provide guidelines for touch gestures. Windows Phone {{is a relatively new}} operating system and the competition on the market is tough, which is why these interface templates will become a tool that facilitates and speeds up the work of the application developers. The templates will be available for the developers to download after the completion of this project. In order to design a strategy and to form an understanding of the task, early studies of user-centered design, C# programming and the structure of Windows Phone were conducted. A user-centered approach was used throughout the project which is why the development of the templates started with a survey in order to find out about the users habits and needs. This resulted in a number of concept sketches containing the functions that were pointed out in the survey. With this as a base a tactility test was created and conducted to clarify which touch gestures that were optimal to control the functions. Based on the concept sketches three prototypes were created with the help of Microsoft Sweden. These prototypes were then usability-tested to point out the user obstacles the prototypes possibly contained. With the results of the usability tests the templates were created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express for Windows Phone and Microsoft Expression Blend 4 for Windows Phone. The results of this project are three interface templates that are based on three different application types and a set of guidelines for the use of touch gestures to control the functions found in the templates...|$|R

The purpose of this investigation is to explore the {{different ways in which}} we can improve the inspection of “Placards & Markings” for Nextjet’s SAAB- 340 aircrafts. This assesment is required by the government in the process of renewing/extending the ARC-airworthiness Review Certificate of the planes. The ARC-process is conducted according to the rules and regulations of the EASA, one of which is a review of the plane’s airworthiness. In this thesis we will explore the plausible ways of inspection while compa- ring and contrasting these different methods. The intent is to find the most adequate and reliable procedure at the lowest cost, with high security. We will focus on three chosen methods: • Visual inspection • ITS - intelligent transport system • Inspection of the aircrafts exterior {{with the help of a}} drone New technologies like ITS and drones are on the rampage and has many advantages. Both ITS and drones enables verifiability and are time-efficient methods. Despite this, the visual inspection method is currently most sui- table for Nextjet and their inspection of the ”Placards & Markings”. Visual inspection is an inexpensive alternative that requires no sophisticated equip- ment. A technical instruction must, according to the studied literature, have a structured format. Consideration should be given to the human factors that come into play during a visual inspection, which can be prevented if kept in mind when designing the instruction. The technical instruction that we designed needs to be tested in its real environment to properly evaluate its function. ...|$|R
40|$|This is <b>a</b> master <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> at KTH Centre for Naval Architecture in {{collaboration}} with Seaware AB and Wallenius Marine AB. Traditionally simulation of ship motion is divided into manoeuvring and seakeeping. In manoeuvring the plane motion in surge, sway and yaw degrees of freedom for a ship considered moving in calm water is simulated. For increased accuracy the roll degree of freedom can be included as it affects the plane motion. In seakeeping ship motion due to waves at a specific speed and course in 3 to 6 DOF (degrees of freedom), depending on the area of interest, is simulated. The motion that a ship undergoes at sea is however dependent on {{the interaction between the}} forces and moments due to waves as well as the forces and moments related to ship manoeuvring. Furthermore, analysis on e. g. methods for counteracting roll motion in waves with rudder movement requires the modelling of forces and moments due to waves and manoeuvring in several DOF. It is therefore desirable to develop a unified model that describes ship motion in several DOF with respect to waves and the effects of manoeuvring. To create a mathematical model, written in MATLAB script, for simulation of ship motion due to waves and the manoeuvring related forces in 5 DOF, a wave induced (Ovegård 2009) and manoeuvrability (Zachrissson 2011) ship motion model were integrated. The code was validated against a linear strip theory, a non-linear ship motion model as well as model experimental results. Results have shown that whilst the heave and pitch motions agree with the models and tank tests the roll motion is seen, in some cases, as creating larger response in comparison to other models and experimental tank tests...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Hyper-reflective {{superficial}} {{cells were}} an unexpected finding while examining the corneal epithelium using confocal microscopy (CM), during <b>an</b> MSc <b>thesis</b> <b>conducted</b> in 2006 at the University of Waterloo, Canada. The author 1 {{suggested that the}} appearance of these hyper-reflective cells could be associated with solution induced corneal staining (SICS) that was also observed in those participants who had manifested these hyper-reflective cells. However, this hypothesis has not {{been reported in the}} literature. This thesis aimed to investigate variables that could possibly predict the appearance of hyper-reflective superficial cells. These investigated variables were the effect of: contact lenses, contact lens solutions, lens/solution combinations, long-term use of certain contact lenses and solutions, age, dry eye symptom, topical anaesthetics and sodium fluorescein. In addition to this, the normal superficial epithelium of controls was defined. Methods: CM images of the superficial epithelium were obtained during the various experiments from: 32 non-contact lens wearing participants, 18 post-menopausal participants symptomatic of dry eye and 18 post-menopausal age-matched asymptomatic women and 147 adapted soft contact lens wearers. For one experiment CM was performed with the contact lens in situ, making the use of a topical anaesthetic unnecessary. Superficial cellular appearance of CM images was graded using a custom grading scale. Hyper-reflective cells were counted. Corneal staining was assessed using sodium fluorescein. Results: Results obtained during the various experiments revealed that hyper-reflective cells predominately appeared {{with the use of a}} specific lens/solution combination. Also, the number of hyper-reflective cells peaked after two hours of lens wear. It was also shown that when hyper-reflective cells occurred during an experiment, not every participant who was exposed to that specific lens/solution combination manifested hyper-reflective cells. Also, a great deal of inter-subject variability in observed numbers of hyper-reflective cells was noted.
