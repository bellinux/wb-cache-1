40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "VA estimates the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collections</b> and reimbursements it expects to receive each year by using a projection model and other methods. These estimates have varied when compared with actual amounts for various reasons. VA used a projection model to estimate its collections for fiscal years 2005 through 2012 based on data reflecting the amount of health careknown as workloadVA has provided {{in the past and}} the amounts VA has collected in the past. To estimate its collections in fiscal year 2013, VA began using a second projection model, known as the Integrated Collections Forecasting Model (ICFM) to estimate collections. The ICFM relies on many of the same data sources as VAs previous collections model, but it also incorporates forecasts related to future workload. For fiscal years 2005 through 2011, VA both overestimated and underestimated its collections. For example, for fiscal year 2011, VA overestimated the amount of its collections by about $ 582 million, or 17 percent. VA officials attribute this difference to several factors, such as overestimating the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collections</b> VA would receive when it billed veterans third-party insurance plans. To estimate the amount of reimbursements it would likely receive in each of the fiscal years, VA used one of two methods depending on the year. For fiscal years 2005 through 2011, VA applied a growth rate to its most recent full year data on actual reimbursement amounts received to reflect anticipated increases in reimbursements, and for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, VA relied on individual reimbursement estimates provided by each of VAs 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks. While VAs estimates of reimbursements were relatively consistent with actual amounts in fiscal years 2005 through 2007, in fiscal years 2008 through 2011, VA underestimated reimbursements by an average of $ 74 million, or 26 percent annually. ...|$|E

Here a feasibility study was made regarding the probability of implimenting a preadmit/precredit system in the Admitting Department. In order to justify the importance of preadmitting, a survey was conducted at three local hospitals where a preadmit system was in effect. These hospitals were: Memorial Hospital of Glendale, Glendale Community Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. This survey proved that preadmitting can be utilized effectively at BCH. The benefits of this preadmit/precredit system have been: to expedite actual admission time, and to secure all data required to establish a complete admission record for preliminary credit and collection work.

40|$|Enabling {{large-scale}} {{monitoring and}} classification {{of a range}} of motion activities is of primary importance due to the need by healthcare and fitness professionals to monitor exercises for quality and compliance. Video based motion capturing systems (e. g., VICON cameras) provide a partial solution. However, these expensive and fixed systems are not suitable for patients' at-home daily motion monitoring. Wireless motion sensors, including accelerometers and gyroscopes, can provide a low-cost, small-size, and highly-mobile option. However, acquiring robust inference of human motion trajectory via low-cost inertial sensors remains challenging. Sensor noise and drift, sensor placement errors and variation of activity over the population all lead to the necessity <b>of</b> a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data <b>collection.</b> Unfortunately, such a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> data <b>collection</b> is prohibitively costly. In observance of these issues, a series of solutions for robust human motion monitoring and activity classification will be presented.

40|$|Purpose of the article: This paper {{examines}} {{possibilities of}} introduction of environmental tax in the Czech Republic {{with a focus}} on road passenger vehicles. It offers theoretical solutions of the issue and evaluates them in terms of their applicability in practice. Article formulates concrete form of environmental tax imposed on road passenger vehicles including quantification of the tax liability of each vehicle. Methodology/methods: Methodological basis are original specific methods based on identified characteristics of the system of environmental taxation of road passenger vehicles. Selection of appropriate features of environmental road tax, the feasibility of alternatives and evaluation of vehicle taxation system is performed using standard general methods of scientific work. Scientific aim: The aim of this paper is on the theoretical basis and practical applicability of the instruments to formulate environmental road tax in the Czech Republic which in turn allows for practical application, including the calculation <b>of</b> the actual <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> annual tax liability of each vehicle registered in the Czech Republic. Findings: The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> tax should depend on the age of the vehicle, fuel type, engine capacity or emissions according to the technical documentation and evaluation of emission unit. Identified <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> environmental road tax is CZK 1. 91 billion.
