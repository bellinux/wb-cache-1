50|$|Though {{the term}} BTS can be {{applicable}} {{to any of the}} wireless communication standards, it is generally associated with mobile communication technologies like GSM and CDMA. In this regard, a BTS forms part of the base station subsystem (BSS) developments for system management. It may also have equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications, spectrum filtering tools (band pass filters), etc. antennas may also be considered as components of BTS in general sense as they facilitate the functioning of BTS. Typically a BTS will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations). A BTS is controlled by a parent base station controller via the base station control function (BCF). The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF provides an operations and maintenance (O&M) connection to the network management system (NMS), and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and <b>alarm</b> <b>collection.</b> The basic structure and functions of the BTS remains the same regardless of the wireless technologies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{continuous}} {{introduction of}} converged {{services such as}} VoIP and Video-On-Demand has created many opera-tional challenges for service providers. In this paper, we describe how to use location-aware technologies, not only to integrate disparate management applications, but also to transform the underlying process to use geographical views as {{the focal point of}} management operations. Based on an engagement with a large Cable provider, we have designed and implemented 3 i-Integrated Infrastructure Intelligence-to address key issues in the service assurance process. 3 i is highly componentized and provides an intuitive way for creating role-based views through dynamic scoping, event aggregation and status projection, and location-driven active probing. We analyze the current service assurance process and compare it with the improved process after introducing 3 i. Overall, the re-engineered process offers base execution improvements in <b>alarm</b> <b>collection,</b> problem drill-down and reporting, as well as complexity improvements throughout. 3 i is a fully implemented tool and has demonstrated capabilities beyond its original intended scope as a decision support tool in planning and marketing functions.

40|$|A new urine {{collection}} method; pad {{and moisture}} sensitive <b>alarm</b> Urine <b>collection</b> pads (UCPs) are a non-invasive and easy {{method of sampling}} urine from young children still in nappies to diagnose or rule out urinary tract infection (UTI). 1 – 3 However, our previous study 4 showed a high rate (27 %) of sample contamination (> 105 mixed growth organisms/ml) by faecal/ perineal flora, making interpretation difficult. We hypothesised that reducing the contact time between urine soaked UCP and peri-neum might reduce this. We therefore devised a new method using the UCP, incorporating the sensor of a personal enuresis alarm burie...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{acquisition}} chain for {{the measurement of}} blood arterial pressure based on the oscillometric method. This method does not suffer from any limitation as the well-known auscultatory method and {{it is suited for}} wearable health monitoring systems. The device uses a pressure sensor whose signal is filtered, digitalized and analyzed by a microcontroller. Local analysis allows the evaluation of the systolic and diastolic pressure values which can be used for local <b>alarms,</b> data <b>collection</b> and remote monitoring.

The core idea is that a number of the bottom sensor collection terminals that consists of temperature and smoking sensors are evenly distributed in the laboratory; when there is a fire to happen, the bottom sensor collection terminals will send an alarming signal by the way of wireless communication to the middle layer <b>alarming</b> signal <b>collection</b> terminal, which starts a GPRS module to capture the scene and send the image to the senior monitoring management center. The senior manager receives an alarming image information, analysis and process, start the appropriate fire alarm system. After a year of testing and running, the system achieves the originally designed aim, and is reliable and stable. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{scientific}} discipline that developed slowly and flourished briefly {{for several decades}} is now nearly gone, leaving behind some knowledge of disease prevention, a few controversial <b>alarms,</b> and a <b>collection</b> of techniques for assessing the health consequences of people’s actions. Among the legacies is the demise of major 20 th-century epidemics attributable to tobacco, dietary fats and some carcinogens {{in the workplace and}} environment. For many, however, epidemiology was an unpleasant science, providing frequent reminders that we are born into a dangerous world where no action is without some risk. Most of us have been persuaded to discard the belief that our modern world is a safe harbour, but now we shall have to muddle along with little specific knowledge of the risks we face. It is a small comfort, at least, that the methods devised by epidemiologists during {{the latter part of the}} 20 th century will endure to serve some future generation with sufficient curiosity to apply them...|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of modern, large-scale control systems {{has given rise}} to new require-ments for monitoring and control of those systems, and capabilities of colorgraphics computer-generated display systems are being applied to provide the user/system/computer interface. An evaluation of the advanced control/display system at the 10 MWe Solar Pilot Plant was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the colorgraphics system and its impact on plant performance and operator workload. A two-phase methodology was applied to evaluate workstation design; colorgraphics display structure, content, format, and readability; control input devices; dialogue structure; display access/utilization; and <b>alarm</b> handling. Data <b>collection</b> procedures included checklist ratings, analysis of documentation, structured interviews, observation of operations, analysis of process reports, and walk-through talk-through simulation. Results indicate the overall suit-ability of the colorgraphics control/display system in meeting the operating requirements, and suggest discrepancy/need areas where performance improvements can be realized. Reso-lution of issues in three areas seems crucial to maximizing the potential of the color-graphics interface: monitoring the process efficiently, retrieving needed information, and handling abnormal events...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intrathoracic {{impedance}} monitoring {{is a new}} {{diagnostic tool}} for patients with heart failure that may aid early identification of decompensation and pulmonary congestion. Methods and Results: The Sensitivity of the InSync Sentry feature for the Prediction of Heart Failure (ie, SENSE-HF) trial is a prospective multicenter international study designed to evaluate the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the intrathoracic impedance diagnostic tool, OptiVol, present in Medtronic implantable devices. A total of 500 patients will be enrolled in the trial, with follow-up for up to 24 months. The study has 3 phases. Phase I is double-blind, and evaluates retrospectively the sensitivity and PPV of the intrathoracic impedance data for the prediction of hospitalization with the signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary congestion. At 6 months, the patient enters Phase II, which evaluates the clinical utility of the nominal ‘‘alarm’’ threshold value for identification of episodes of decompensation. The patient enters the final phase (Phase III) after an episode of decompensation correctly identified by the Fluid Trend data (‘‘true’’ positive <b>alarm),</b> with data <b>collection</b> on how physicians use the Fluid Trend data to influence management. An end point committee adjudicates health care utilizations events (hospitalizations and doctor visits) for their association with signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary congestion. Conclusions: The study completed recruitment during 2008...|$|R
40|$|Alarm fatigue is a {{practice}} problem {{that applies to}} hospitalized patients and the nurses who care for them. Addressing alarm fatigue is important to promote alarm safety and to decrease the risk of patient harm or death. The {{purpose of this study}} was to decrease alarm fatigue and improve alarm safety in a regional neonatal intensive care unit (RNICU). Guided by the conceptual model for alarm fatigue and alarm safety, this study addressed whether or not alarm management protocols designed to decrease false and nuisance alarms in the physiological monitoring of neonates improve alarm safety via decreased alarm burden and alarm fatigue as evidenced by statistically significant reductions in false and nuisance alarms. A quantitative, time series quasi-experimental design was used with 4 waves of data collection. One wave was baseline data collected preintervention, and 3 waves of data were postprotocol implementation to obtain an initial indication of sustainability. <b>Alarm</b> observation data <b>collection</b> sheets were developed and used to track numbers and types of alarms pre- and post-protocol implementation. The data analysis showed statistically significant decreases in both false alarms and nuisance alarms related to the physiological monitoring protocol and lead changing protocol. Overall, high protocol adherence was noted, and the total number of alarms per hour per bed was reduced by 42...|$|R
