5|$|Box {{lacrosse}}, {{also known}} as indoor lacrosse and sometimes shortened to boxla or simply box, is an indoor version of lacrosse played mostly in North America. The game originated in Canada, where {{it is the most}} popular version of the game played in contrast to the traditional field lacrosse game. It is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each, and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered. The playing area is called <b>a</b> <b>box,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse. The object of the game is to use a long handled racket, known as a lacrosse stick, to catch, carry, and pass the ball in an effort to score by ultimately hurling a solid rubber lacrosse ball into an opponent's goal.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{borrowed}} from his surroundings, {{as he had}} done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had seen. One such location was a motel in the Adirondacks in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel. Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> the Royalty Kinema, Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment. A colleague at The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, gave his name to a printer in the story while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.|$|E
5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> the car, right next to Andy.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{piece of}} {{protective}} {{equipment in the}} sport of cricket is known as <b>a</b> <b>box.</b> <b>In</b> cricket, a box is usually worn by only a batsman, a wicket-keeper, and sometimes other close-up fielders. For fielders farther from the batsman, the wearing of a box would impede their movement and running (for batsmen the benefits outweigh the disadvantages).|$|E
25|$|Poh Huat (Richard Low), {{the father}} of the Loh family, works as a lawyer's clerk. He is married to Siew Luan (Alice Lim), a {{housewife}} who likes to brew liang teh (herbal tea) for the family. Poh Huat has a habit of buying lottery tickets in hope of winning and enjoying a better life. He also keeps newspaper cuttings of car models and condominiums and stores them in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> his room.|$|E
25|$|Box {{lacrosse}} {{is played}} by teams of six on a hockey rink where the ice has been removed or covered by artificial turf, or in an indoor soccer or lacrosse field. The enclosed playing area is called <b>a</b> <b>box,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to the open playing field of the traditional game. This version of the game {{was introduced in the}} 1930s to promote business for hockey arenas, and within several years had nearly supplanted field lacrosse in Canada.|$|E

25|$|The Riverworld series {{originated}} in a novel, Owe for the Flesh, written {{in one month}} in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, but the book was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, {{a copy of a}} revised version of the original novel surfaced in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> a garage and was published as River of Eternity by Phantasia Press in 1983. Farmer's Introduction to this edition gives the details of how it all happened.|$|E
25|$|In another, single-stimulus rehabilitatory approach, {{the patient}} is shown a {{computer}} screen with <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> each corner and a fixation cross at the center. When a stimulus appears {{in any of the}} boxes, {{the patient is}} instructed to indicate seeing it as quickly as possible. This task is eased somewhat by an indicating icon before the stimulus – either an arrow that points to the box the stimulus is most likely (but not guaranteed) to be in, or a cross to indicate that the stimulus could appear in any box. Following thirty hour-long sessions, patients demonstrated a significant decrease in both extinction and hemispatial neglect.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the 1955 {{election}} {{have been attributed to}} fraud and intimidation. Voters were intimidated by a voting system involving colored pieces of paper that had to be put into <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> full view of Sihanouk's political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon or Democrat majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.|$|E

25|$|In 1712, {{during the}} Kangxi Emperor's last {{inspection}} {{tour of the}} south, Yinreng, who {{was put in charge}} of state affairs during his father's absence, tried to vie for power again with his supporters. He allowed an attempt at forcing the Kangxi Emperor to abdicate when his father returned to Beijing. However, the emperor received news of the planned coup d'etat, and was so angry that he deposed Yinreng and placed him under house arrest again. After the incident, the emperor announced that he would not appoint any of his sons as crown prince for the remainder of his reign. He stated that he would place his Imperial Valedictory Will inside <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> the Palace of Heavenly Purity, which would only be opened after his death.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Lopez's great-grandchildren rediscovered <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> {{their late}} grandfather's attic {{containing}} the items Ernesto Lopez had found plus {{what appeared to}} be his wedding photo. The family brought the box to the attention of a local reporter, whose TV news report on the strange find was picked up by several national and international news outlets. However, upon examination, experts at the Tampa Bay History Center determined that the coins were likely a collection of 20th century coins plus souvenirs from an early Gasparilla parade and the map was a plat map from the 1920s with local streets, businesses, and landmarks from that time clearly depicted. The origin of the hand remained a mystery, though the curator of the history center opined that it might be a mummified monkey hand.|$|E
25|$|Fritillaria (fritillaries) is a genus {{of spring}} {{flowering}} herbaceous bulbous perennial {{plants in the}} lily family (Liliaceae). The type species, Fritillaria meleagris, was first described in Europe in 1571, while other species from the Middle East and Asia were also introduced to Europe at that time. The genus has about 130–140 species divided among eight subgenera. The flowers are usually solitary, nodding and bell-shaped with bulbs that have fleshy scales, resembling those of lilies. They {{are known for their}} very large genome size and genetically are very closely related to lilies. They are native to the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, from the Mediterranean and North Africa through Eurasia and southwest Asia to western North America. Many are endangered due to enthusiastic picking. The name Fritillaria is thought to refer to the checkered pattern of F. meleagris, resembling <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> which dice were carried. Fritillaries are commercially important in horticulture as ornamental garden plants and also in traditional Chinese medicine, which is also endangering a number of species. Fritillaria flowers have been popular subjects for artists to depict and as emblems of regions and organisations.|$|E

25|$|In 1884 Van and Ada, age 14 and 12, fall passionately in love, {{and their}} affair {{is marked by}} a {{powerful}} sense of romantic eroticism. The book opens with their discovery that they are in fact not cousins but brother and sister. The passage is notoriously difficult, more so as neither of them explicitly states the conclusion they have drawn (treating it as obvious), and it is only referred to in passing later in the text. Although Ada's mother keeps a wedding photo dated August 1871, eleven months before her birth, they find in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> the attic a newspaper announcement dating the wedding to December 1871; and furthermore that Dan had been abroad since that spring, as proved by his extensive filmreels. Hence he is not Ada's father. Furthermore, they find an annotated flower album kept by Marina in 1869–70 which indicates, very obliquely, that she was pregnant and confined to a sanatorium {{at the same time as}} Aqua; that 99 orchids were delivered to Marina, from Demon, on Van's birthday; and that Aqua had a miscarriage in a skiing accident. It later transpires that Marina gave the child to her sister to replace the one she had lost—so she is in fact Van's mother—and that her affair with Demon continued until Ada's conception. This makes Lucette (Dan and Marina's child) the uterine half-sister of both of them.|$|E

[...] They then feast in Penfro for eighty years in a hall with three doors, and only remember the dreadful events that happened in Ireland when the third door opens.

500|$|In German use, 72 {{rounds of}} 37mm {{ammunition}} were carried. These were stored in 6-round boxes: {{three on the}} hull side wall, eight in the turret overhang and one ready box above the gun on the turret roof. For the machine gun, 1,800 rounds of belted 7.92mm ammunition were carried. The machine gun ammunition was in 100 round belts, stored three to <b>a</b> <b>box.</b> <b>In</b> Czech service, the LT vz. 35 carried 78 rounds (24 AP, 54 HE) and 2,700 rounds of machine gun ammunition, the difference being removed {{to make room for}} the fourth crewmember in German service.

500|$|Bury was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age and was educated at a charitable school in the English Midlands. After a few years in regular employment, he fell into financial difficulty, was dismissed for theft, and became a street peddler. In 1887 he moved to London, where he married Ellen Elliot, who was probably a prostitute. During their stormy marriage, which lasted just over a year, they faced increasing financial hardship. In January 1889, they moved to Dundee. The following month, Bury strangled his wife with a rope, stabbed her dead body with a penknife, and hid the corpse in <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>in</b> their room. A few days later, he presented himself to the local police and was arrested for her murder. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to death by hanging. Shortly before his execution, he confessed to the crime. Although Bury's guilt was not in doubt, Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty and The Dundee Courier printed an editorial the day after his execution decrying the [...] "judicial butcheries" [...] of capital punishment.|$|E
