40|$|Expert {{systems can}} be used to govern the {{intelligent}} control of vehicles, for example the Robotic Air Vehicle (RAV). Due {{to the nature of the}} RAV system the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system needs to perform in a demanding real-time environment. The use of a parallel processing capability to support the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system's computational requirement is critical in this application. Thus, algorithms for parallel real-time expert systems must be designed, analyzed, and synthesized. The design process incorporates a consideration of the rule-set/face-set size along with representation issues. These issues are looked at in reference to information movement and various inference mechanisms. Also examined is the process involved with transporting the RAV expert system functions from the TI Explorer, where they are implemented in the Automated Reasoning Tool (ART), to the iPSC Hypercube, where the system is synthesized using Concurrent Common LISP (CCLISP). The transformation process for the ART to CCLISP conversion is described.

40|$|A Site Security Officer (SSO) who is {{a network}} {{security}} staff that responds to alarms from an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), is always faced with the critical problem of low response time when the network becomes big. Even a skilled SSO is hard-pressed and less productive when collecting and analyzing IDS output manually as the frequency of intrusion increases. In this work, an Expert System-Based SSO (ExSSO) is designed to correct this problem. The design presents an architecture that encodes <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> rules for responding to different categories of intrusions into its rule-based component. The Intrusion Index (II), which determines the extent of intrusion, is calculated to classify intrusions into three categories namely low, high and very high. The inference engine component utilizes the encoded rules to interpret and respond to intrusions based on the Intrusion Index. Visual Basic 6. 0 is used to implement the design because of its interactiveness and high ability to support database.

40|$|Negativity {{towards the}} {{institutions}} of formal politics is currently a concern {{across much of the}} democratic world. It is generally agreed that such negativity increased among British citizens {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. In this paper, we analyse a novel dataset not previously used to study this topic: Mass Observation’s General Election diaries. Since diarists wrote mostly about politicians, political campaigns, and associated media coverage, we ask specifically what the diaries can tell us about increased negativity towards politicians and its relationship to developments in political communication. We take a postholing approach to sampling of the diaries, enabling comparative-static analysis between the middle and end of the twentieth century. We view the diaries in a geographical framework derived from contextual theories of social action. This gives us a focus on spaces of political encounter, modes of political interaction, performances by politicians, and judgements by citizens. We argue that prominent spaces of political encounter changed over the period from long radio speeches and rowdy political meetings to televised debates and <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> commentary. We demonstrate how these latter settings for political interaction afforded less opportunity for politicians to perform virtues to citizens, and for citizens to calibrate judgements of politicians...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn human {{reliability}} analysis (HRA), dependence analysis refers to assessing {{the influence of}} the failure of the operators to perform one task on the failure probabilities of subsequent tasks. A commonly used approach is the technique for human error rate prediction (THERP). The assessment of the dependence level in THERP is a highly subjective judgment based on general rules for the influence of five main factors. A frequently used alternative method extends the THERP model with decision trees. Such trees should increase the repeatability of the assessments but they simplify the relationships among the factors and the dependence level. Moreover, the basis for these simplifications and the resulting tree is difficult to trace. The aim of this work is a method for dependence assessment in HRA that captures the rules used by experts to assess dependence levels and incorporates this knowledge into an algorithm and software tool to be used by HRA analysts. A fuzzy expert system (FES) underlies the method. The method and the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> elicitation process are demonstrated with a working model. The expert rules are elicited systematically and converted into a traceable, explicit, and computable model. Anchor situations are provided as guidance for the HRA analyst's judgment of the input factors. The expert model and the FES-based dependence assessment method make the expert rules accessible to the analyst in a usable and repeatable way, with an explicit and traceable basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a probabilistic structural analysis methodology (PSAM) is described. In the near-term, the methodology will be applied to designing critical components {{of the next generation}} space shuttle main engine. In the long-term, PSAM will be applied very broadly, providing designers with a new technology for more effective design of structures whose character and performance are significantly affected by random variables. The software under development to implement the ideas developed in PSAM resembles, in many ways, conventional deterministic structural analysis code. However, several additional capabilities regarding the probabilistic analysis makes the input data requirements and the resulting output even more complex. As a result, an intelligent front- and back-end to the code is being developed to assist the design engineer in providing the input data in a correct and appropriate manner. The type of knowledge that this entails is, in general, heuristically-based, allowing the fairly well-understood technology of production rules to apply with little difficulty. However, the PSAM code, called NESSUS, is written in FORTRAN- 77 and runs on a DEC VAX. Thus, the <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> system, called NESSUS/EXPERT, must run on a DEC VAX as well, and integrate effectively and efficiently with the existing FORTRAN code.

40|$|Abstract- Immunoassays are now an {{important}} part of the daily activity of the clinical laboratory, concerning various parameters as hormones, tumor markers, drugs, antibodies, viruses and bacterias. The evolution of the instrumentation in this domain is similar to the one in biochemistry. The requirements may be summarized as follows: non isotopic immunoassays, high throughput, large panel of analytes with a low detection limit, stabilized reagents, full automation with easy calibration and even random access. To fulfill these specifications, many analytical and technological problems have to be solved:- Sample identification, detection, and eventual dilution. - "Reagents " may be liquid solutions, suspensions (latex, magnetic particles, liposomes), fibrous materials, and coated tubes or wells. Each type of reagent induces a specific processing. - Reaction processing needs an incubation step and, in the case of heterogeneous immunoassays, washing and separation steps. The delays of the immunological reaction and of the final signal development will determine the size of the incubator, i. e. the size of the instrument, and the throughput of the system. - Signal measurement of low energy light was improved by reducing artefacts due to matrix and optical cuvets, but also by using photon counting detectors. some case replaced by a "master curve " made by the manufacturer for each reagent lot. - Calibration is simplified by automated calculation, memorization and in Future systems should better take in account the biosafety, help the operator to validate calibration, controls and results, and help to clinical interpretation by <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{science and}} its <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> voices often serve {{multiple}} {{roles in the}} context of complex environmental conflicts: investigators of undesirable environmental conditions; guarantors of “valuefree” and de-politicised expertise and information regarding those conditions; authors of rationales that support one management decision over another; and sources of authority used to persuade sceptics or the public that a certain environmental action is logical and desirable. However, recent thinking in science and technology studies (STS) and political ecology emphasises how scientific knowledge and expertise are co-produced with the political, economic, and cultural arrangements characteristic of a given society and a given locale. In many environmental conflicts, expert knowledge is challenged {{on the grounds that it}} is out of touch and politically compromised. This paper examines the diverse scientific discourses and environmental narratives surrounding dam-removal processes in the region of New England, United States. Dam removals are increasingly seen by environmental advocacy organisations and state agencies as a means to rehabilitate degraded riverine systems, and these actors muster an array of science-based arguments in support of removal. Conversely, opponents highlight their placebased knowledge to counter the claims of removal advocates and question the motivations of expert knowledge. These competing claims feed into conflicts over dam removals in intriguing ways, and understanding how scientific knowledge and expertise are used (and misused) is crucial to understanding conflicts over river restoration and developing more participatory strategies of water governance. The question is not so much whose claims are truthful, but how such claims are inserted into, and negotiated within, controversial ecological interventions. ...|$|E

40|$|The dam of Mosul on the Tigris {{river in}} {{northern}} Iraq {{is the largest}} in the country and holds around 11 km 3 of water. Built on water permeable rock, the inherent instability of the Mosul dam has been known since it was built and this was mitigated by continuous grouting. In recent years adequate maintenance has not taken place, leading to concerns about the safety of the dam. In 2003 the government decided to lower the maximum water level from 330 to 319 metres. During the recent conflict, maintenance has again been disrupted and signs at the dam have triggered renewed concerns, highlighted in the Schnabel report. As a result, the government of Iraq have contracted the Italian engineering company Trevi to undertake remedial work on the dam. This work is scheduled to start later in the Spring of 2016. In late February 2016 the Iraqi government advised the residents of Mosul to move at least 5 km away from the river in case of breach. A UN mission of UNDAC experts left for Iraq in early April to assess the situation, supported by an <b>associated</b> <b>expert</b> from the European Union Civil Protection Mechanism. A number of studies have been devoted to the possible effects of a failure of the dam. In this study we perform a number of medium-resolution (180 m) dynamic hydraulic simulations starting from various constant percentages of destruction of the dam and allowing the corresponding quantity of water (supposing the lake to be at its highest level) to flow downslope for periods of 6 and 12 days. Compared to previous studies we provide in addition a complete timescale of the water flow progression, detailed maps of the water depth and extent in the affected cities’ areas and focus more on the numbers of population affected by various water depths. The main scenario analysed in this study, where the dam is 26 % destroyed, the level of the lake is at its maximum value of 330 m, and most of the lake’s water is allowed to flow out fast, results in a very high wave of water (in places 25 m high, mean height around 12 m) arriving at Mosul city after 1 h 40 min. The capital Baghdad is reached after about 3. 5 days with a max water height of 8 m and a mean of around 2 m. The simulations suggest that in the above scenario a total of more than 6 million people (close to one sixth of the country’s population) will be affected by floodwaters, with two million of them facing water of more than 2 m. Water heights of more than 10 m would inundate an area with 270 000 people, most of them in Mosul city and its surroundings, whose lives, houses and infrastructure would risk complete destruction. A number of other scenarios involving lower initial levels of the lake are also analysed, considering levels of 319 m (the current one), and 315, 309, 307, 305 and 300 m. Significant reductions in the affected populations and later arrival times are seen for lower initial lake levels. The differences are quite prominent in Mosul as well as in Baghdad, where we also provide detailed maps of the inundation in the various cases. The scenario of part of the flood wave being diverted to lake Tharthar by an existing channel near Samarra is also examined in detail. These results are a first-order approximation, favouring speed of calculation over detail for a rapid assessment; it is planned to refine them later using higher resolution ground elevation data (that take much longer to run) and more detailed, time-dependent scenarios of dam failure.
