5|$|There were at most 20,000 comfort women. None of {{them were}} {{forcibly}} recruited. Forty percent {{of them were}} from Japan, the most heavily represented nation. Many were sold to brokers by their parents. Some responded willingly to brokers' offers; others were deceived. I would <b>add</b> <b>that,</b> on the average, living conditions in the comfort stations were practically identical to those in brothels set up for American troops during the Vietnam War.|$|E

Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy was [...] "happy all the time" [...] {{although}} he felt like Rudy was [...] "a bit of a sociopath" [...] because he [...] "doesn't question things he says or does" [...] and doesn't care what people think about him. Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "not a bad person" [...] and is [...] "quite endearing". He <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy [...] "doesn't question anything", has [...] "no set motive" [...] and [...] "lives for the moment". Gilgun also <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "consistently wrong". Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "a total plonker who gets into multiple scrapes wherever he goes - and with whoever he meets".|$|R

5|$|Latin sources <b>add</b> <b>that</b> Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a {{deep sleep}} so he could be blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E
5|$|The Hetumoger {{confederation}} {{was under}} a dual leadership, according to Ibn Rusta and Gardizi (two Muslim scholars from the 10th and 11thcenturies, respectively, whose geographical books preserved texts from an earlier work written by Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani from Bukhara). The Hungarians' nominal or sacred leader was styled kende, while their military commander bore the title gyula. The same authors <b>add</b> <b>that</b> the gyula commanded an army of 20,000 horsemen, but the reliability of this number is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does <b>add</b> <b>that</b> the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|Former British {{soldier and}} writer Ken Wharton {{published}} {{in his book}} Wasted Years, Wasted Lives, Volume 1, an alternative theory that was suggested to him by loyalist paramilitarism researcher Jeanne Griffin; this was that the ambush was planned by Robin Jackson as an elaborate means of eliminating trumpet player Brian McCoy. Griffin suggests that McCoy, who originally came from Caledon, County Tyrone and had strong UDR and Orange Order family connections, was possibly approached at some stage by Jackson {{with a view of}} securing his help in carrying out UVF attacks in the Irish Republic. When McCoy refused, Jackson then hatched his plan to murder McCoy and his bandmates in retaliation, even macabrely choosing Buskhill as the ambush site due to its similarity to Bus-kill. Griffin goes on to <b>add</b> <b>that</b> the bogus checkpoint was set up not only to plant the bomb on board the van but to ensure the presence of McCoy which would have been confirmed when he handed over his driver's license to the gunmen. She also thinks that had everything gone to plan once the bomb was planted in the van McCoy would have been instructed to drive through Newry where the bomb would have gone off and the UVF could then afterwards portray the Miami Showband as IRA members on a mission to blow up the local RUC barracks. Griffin based her theory on the nine bullets that were fired from a Luger into McCoy's body and that Jackson's fingerprints were found on the silencer used for a Luger. She furthermore opined that Jackson was the man Travers saw kicking McCoy's body {{to make sure he was}} dead.|$|E
5|$|The rebels quickly {{extended}} their {{control over the}} neighbouring towns of Venosa, Ascoli, and Lavello. Dokeianos, who had just reimposed order in Bari and the surrounding region, marched to meet them with a hastily assembled and incomplete force: most of the imperial army was still in Sicily, so that Skylitzes writes that Dokeianos only took the Opsician {{and part of the}} Thracesian contingents with him, while other sources also <b>add</b> <b>that</b> his army comprised elements of the Varangian Guard. The two armies met at the Olivento river, where Dokeianos was defeated in a battle fought on 17 March. The rebels then moved south towards the coast, and on 4 May defeated another Byzantine force under Dokeianos in another battle near Cannae, a field that had served as the site for the famous battle of 216 BC and the first Norman engagement in southern Italy in 1018. The Annales Barenses claims, with obvious exaggeration, that 2,000 Normans defeated 18,000 Byzantines, but whatever the true numbers it does appear that the Byzantines considerably outnumbered the rebel forces. Dokeianos himself fell from his horse during the battle and was almost captured, until rescued by a squire. In the aftermath of the battle, both sides remained quiescent. The Lombards and Normans were probably exhausted and may have suffered heavy casualties, while the Byzantines regrouped: Dokeianos was recalled and replaced by Exaugustus Boioannes, while the garrisons in Sicily were withdrawn to the Italian mainland to face the rebel threat.|$|E
