2500|$|The older {{of these}} lines is the Tünel. This {{line is the}} oldest {{underground}} metro line in continental Europe, and the second in the world after London. [...] The Tünel is 573 m long with an <b>altitude</b> <b>difference</b> of 60m and no intermediate stations between Karaköy and Tünel Square. It has been continuously in service since 1875. It was originally steam-powered with two wooden trains serving parallel tracks. It was modernized in 1971.

About 15,000 people use the line each day.|$|E

30|$|The beam-broadening {{correction}} σ_b^ 2 {{requires the}} knowledge of horizontal winds estimated from off-vertical beam data, and these winds may not be exactly those at the altitudes sampled by the vertical beam. It is another source of bias (Deghan and Hocking 2011), but difficult to correct in general. However, since the measurements were taken for low altitudes (<  4.5  km), this problem should be minimized here because the sampled <b>altitude</b> <b>differences</b> between the vertical and oblique directions do not exceed a few tens of meters.|$|R

30|$|The {{boundaries}} between bright and dark regions from pole to pole as seen at different wavelengths {{do not appear}} to be at the same latitudes. For example, there is a clear boundary in the morphology patterns at midlatitudes at all wavelengths except at the thermal infrared (8 – 12  µm) where the boundary is between 60 ° and 70 ° latitude. The LIR data indicate brightness temperature changes across latitudes of no more than 10 – 15  K, and the 2.02 -µm images do reveal some <b>altitude</b> <b>differences</b> due to different CO 2 absorption at polar latitudes.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{complicated}} urban environment {{in terms of}} materials, reflection, emission, wind flows around buildings, <b>altitude</b> <b>differences</b> etc. the simulation tool must be selected very carefully.

This inevitably leads to the employment of computational fluid dynamics general codes (PHOENICS) but with increased demand of computational resources. Other tools may be useful for the assessment of individual parameters, such as surface materials and trees’ thermal influence (Matzarakis et al., 2006) but this would not assess the wind flow effect in geometrical detail.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} 1) the agricultural system changed by <b>altitude</b> <b>differences,</b> 2) pastoralism system with using <b>altitude</b> <b>differences,</b> 3) the broad trade system in Ladakh, and to analyze 4) factors which form the complex system among agriculture, pastoralism and broad trade in Ladakh. From the survey on uses of environments by the local peoples in Domkhar villages and Kuramric, it became clear that the agricultural activity plays the core role on their subsistence and they take the livestock feeding and broad trade into their subsistence mainly according to the pattern of agricultural activities. The characteristics of subsistence in Ladakh is that one household involves in the activities of agriculture, pastoralism and also broad trade. Because of the arid condition in Ladalkh, the villages are located in the flat area of alluvial fan or valley to get water resources. It was considered that the severe restricting factors such as aridity, coldness and limited flat area in Ladakh make the multiple production activities necessary for an each household. Under these severe natural circumstances, Ladakh peoples try to adapt to the highland space by taking such life mode as “modesty and mutual cooperation”. Although the natural circumstances deeply restrict the life of Ladakh peoples, they encourage their life to use its natural circumstances better by the life mode as “modesty and mutual cooperation”, which forms the highland civilization in Ladakh...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} on 21.June 1896 that Hartmann & Co opened their two Metre gauge lines both of which linked Minin-Pozharsky (Малой Покровским) Square with what has since been renamed Gorky Square. However, the two lines {{followed}} different routes. There was a 3.7 km line through the upper town (Grand Kremlin / citadel) and a 1.4 km line through the lower (river shore level) town. Together they therefore formed a closed [...] "circle" [...] tramline, except {{that at the end}} points the <b>altitude</b> <b>differences</b> were far too extreme for a continuous line: for passengers/pedestrians the terminus stations were therefore connected using large elaborate elevators (lifts), known as the Kremlewski Elevator and the Poklavinsky Elevator.|$|R
40|$|The Curiosity rover is {{exploring}} 155 km diameter Gale crater and Mt. Sharp, Gale's 5 km high central mound (Fig. 1). This study addresses {{the formation and}} erosion history of Mt. Sharp. Gale lies on the topographic dichotomy between the southern highlands and the northern plains - a drop of over 2 km [1, 2]. <b>Altitude</b> <b>differences</b> {{between the north and}} south rim reflect this regional slope, as do <b>altitude</b> <b>differences</b> between the deep annulus north of Mt. Sharp and the southern crater floor. Orbiter and rover images demonstrate that most exposed areas on Mt. Sharp consist of thin, sub-parallel units interpreted as sedimentary layers [3]. Gale is typical of the 50 large martian craters that have been totally or partially filled with such layers [4, 5]. In many craters these sediments have been deeply eroded. Central Peak and Peak Ring: The highest point on Mt. Sharp, near the crater's center, is interpreted as a central peak [6]. The peak has a massive lower portion and a thin, smooth capping deposit (Fig. 2). Gale's size is transitional between martian craters with single central peaks and craters with peak rings approximately half the crater's diameter [2, 6]. The boundaries of Mt. Sharp, as well as an arc of hills to the southeast of the mountain, closely match a circle approximately 80 km in diameter (Fig. 3). This morphology suggests that the Gale impact may have formed both a central peak and a partial peak ring, which is covered by the sediments of Mt. Sharp in the north and possibly exposed in the arc of eroded hills in the southeast quadrant (Figs. 3, 4) ...|$|R
