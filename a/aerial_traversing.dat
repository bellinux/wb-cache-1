40|$|Response of an {{experimental}} Fraunhofer line discriminator {{to a wide}} range of surficial deposits common in deserts and semideserts was tested in the laboratory and from an H- 19 helicopter. No signals attributable to fluorescence were recorded during 540 miles of <b>aerial</b> <b>traverses</b> over southeastern California and west-central Arizona. It was concluded that exposed surfaces of target materials throughout the traverses were either nonluminescent at 5890 A or not sufficiently so to be detectable. It cannot be ruled out that the lack of fluorescence is partly attributable to surficial coatings of nonluminescent weathered material. The principal route surveyed from the air was from Needles, California to Furnace Creek Ranch, Death Valley and return, via the Amargosa River valley, Silurian Lake (dry), Silver Lake (dry), and Soda Lake (dry). Principal targets traversed were unconsolidated clastic sediments ranging from silty clay to cobbles, and a wide range of evaporite deposits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{iterative}} temporal registration {{algorithm is}} {{presented in this paper}} 1 for registering 3 D range images obtained from unmanned ground and <b>aerial</b> vehicles <b>traversing</b> unstructured environments. We are primarily motivated by the development of 3 D registration algorithms to overcome both the unavailability and unreliability of Global Positioning System (GPS) within required accuracy bounds for Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) navigation. After suitable modifications to the well-known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, the modified algorithm is shown to be robust to outliers and false matches during the registration of successive range images obtained from a scanning LADAR rangefinder on the UGV. Towards registering LADAR images from the UGV with those from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that flies over th...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, aerial {{vehicles}} {{have allowed}} exploring scenarios with harsh conditions. These can conduct reconnaissance tasks {{in areas that}} change periodically and have a high spatial and temporal resolution. The objective of a reconnaissance task is to survey an area and retrieve strategic information. The aerial vehicles, however, have inherent constraints in terms of energy and transmission range due to their mobility. Despite these constraints, the Data Foraging problem requires the aerial vehicles to exchange information about profitable data sources. In Data Foraging, establishing a single path is not viable because of dynamic conditions of the environment. Thus, reconnaissance must be focused on periodically searching profitable environmental data sources, as some animals perform foraging. In this work, a data-foraging-oriented reconnaissance algorithm based on bio-inspired indirect communication for aerial vehicles is presented. The approach establishes several paths that overlap to identify valuable data sources. Inspired by the stigmergy principle, the aerial vehicles indirectly communicate through artificial pheromones. The <b>aerial</b> vehicles <b>traverse</b> the environment using a heuristic algorithm that uses the artificial pheromones as feedback. The solution is formally defined and mathematically evaluated. In addition, we show {{the viability of the}} algorithm by simulations which have been tested through various statistical hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{deformation}} surveying techniques have been extensively used {{for measuring the}} pattern of ground subsidence. These include precise levelling, total station <b>traversing,</b> <b>aerial</b> photogrammetry and GPS surveys. The impact on the surface infrastructure of underground coal mining to the southwest of Sydney is continuously monitored {{using a combination of}} these techniques. Since 2002, experiments have been conducted in the Appin area to test the feasibility of also using a remote sensing technique for ground subsidence monitoring. The technique uses the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images captured by several orbiting satellites, processed in a special way known as the differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) to extract terrain change information. First, several ground features were surveyed as ground control points (GCPs) using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Next, the GCPs were used in the radar interferometric processing of a pair of ERS- 1 / 2 satellite images to generate a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) for the test site. In the third step, DInSAR processing was carried out using many combinations of repeat-pass satellite radar images. In this step the previosuly generated DEM was used to remove the topographic information so that any ground movement could be detected. In the last step, the DInSAR results were exported to...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. By {{the end of}} 1973, <b>aerial</b> infrared scanner <b>traverses</b> for thermal anomaly recordings of all Cascade Range volcanoes were essentially completed. Amplitude level slices of the Mount Baker anomalies were completed and compiled at a scale of 1 : 24, 000, thus producing, for the first time, an accurate map of the distribution and intensity of thermal activity on Mount Baker. The major thermal activity is concentrated within the crater south of the main summit and although it is characterized by intensive solfataric activity and warm ground, it is largely subglacial, causing the development of sizable glacier perforation features. The outgoing radiative flux from the east breach anomalies is sufficient {{to account for the}} volume of ice melted to form the glacier perforations. DCP station 6251 has been monitoring a thermally anomalous area on the north slope of Mount Baker. The present thermal activity of Mount Baker accounts for continuing hydrothermal alteration in the crater south of the main summit and recurrent debris avalanches from Sherman Peak on its south rim. The infrared anomalies mapped as part of the experiment SR 251 are considered the basic evidence of the subglacial heating which was the probable triggering mechanism of an avalanche down Boulder Glacier on August 20 - 21, 1973...|$|R

Prijašnja saznanja upućivala su na velik potencijal ovog plodnoga ravničarskog kraja s velikim parcelama u primjeni ove arheološke metode. Uz sad već brojne mrežne stranice koje donose vertikalne i satelitske snimke, snimanje kosih snimaka iz zrakoplova omogućilo je ciljano arheološko istraživanje. Aerial archaeological {{survey in}} two {{sessions}} on June 6 and November 12 captured {{a series of}} new sites in eastern Slavonia. Apart from the new sites, known sites were also captured, such as, Klisa, airport (fig. 1) (Radić 2007 : 284) and Ivanovac, Kolođvar (fig. 2). Sites were spotted either as soil marks (fig. 2), crop marks (fig. 3) or shadow marks (fig. 4). Imagery from <b>traverse</b> <b>aerial</b> shots was completed with the analysis of vertical aerial imagery from cyclic survey by the State Geodetic Administration (SGA) from ARKOD and Geoportal stations, as well as Google Earth, Bingmaps. The analysis confirmed the presence of several sites located during aerial survey in June and November. A site which has {{a large number of}} images from practically all the mentioned sources is Klisa, airport (fig. 1). Most circle-shaped sites appear as individual circles, such as Ivankovo (fig. 5) and Viškovci (fig. 4) and concentric circles in case of Levanjska Varoš (fig. 6). They can also appear as identical circles one next to other, which happens to be the case with Preslatinci, Ugljare (fig. 7) (Dekker 1959) or as a combination of big and smaller circles, for example Vrbica, Drake (fig. 8) or Kešinci, Glomač-Požarike (fig. 9). There are remarkable examples of large oval fortifications such as Markušica, Novoševci (fig. 10). Most of the sites have been surveyed and archaeological material has been found on most of them (pottery and lithic finds, mostly). Preliminary view of the pottery has confirmed that the sites cover almost all archaeological periods, but mostly Neolithic and the Middle Ages...|$|R
40|$|The 1946 M 7. 3 Ancash {{earthquake}} {{triggered a}} large number of landslides in an epicentral area along the continental divide in the Andes of Peru. Reconnaissance reports by Silgado (1947, 1951), Heim (1949) and Rüegg (1950) published shortly after the earthquake describe some of the landslides, but lack any detailed documentation. A review of literature, field <b>traverses,</b> <b>aerial</b> photograph interpretation and GIS mapping, identified 45 landslides inferred to have been triggered by the event. The cumulative volume-frequency plot shows a strong power law relation, similar in form to that derived for landslides triggered by the 1994 Northridge earthquake (Harp and Jibson, 1995). Data for the Ancash earthquake plots near the regression line calculated by Keefer (1994), and modified by Malamud et al. (2004), for earthquake moment magnitude vs. total volume moved by landslides during the earthquake. A denudation (average surface lowering) of 76 mm and a denudation rate of 0. 00585 mm/yr was estimated for the area over which the earthquake-triggered landslides occurred. Rock avalanches constituted 83 % of the landslides which involved Cretaceous limestones interbedded with shales. Rock slope failures were common on slopes with a southwest aspect, an orientation corresponding to the regional dip direction of major planar structures in the epicentral area. In valleys oriented transverse to the NW-SE structural trend of the epicentral area, south-westerly dipping bedding planes combined with orthogonal joint sets to form numerous wedge failures. Three rock avalanches were analysed using conventional wedge failure criteria. Two of the rock avalanches which did not satisfy conventional criteria were utilized to develop a new criteria, i. e. stepped wedge criteria. Stepped wedge failure involves wedge movement along a stepped line of intersection formed by a nearly-vertical discontinuity, striking roughly parallel to the slope, and the conventional line of intersection formed by the bedding and orthogonal joint set. The nearly-vertical discontinuity forms the essential backscarp needed to facilitate stepped wedge failure. Additional characteristics of stepped wedge failure were also distinguished based on the wedge failures studied in the epicentral area of the 1946 Ancash earthquake...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{change in}} {{emphasis}} from tractor and highlead logging systems to the advanced logging systems of skyline, balloon, and helicopter has stirred researchers {{to study the}} operations of the advanced systems. The extra work involved in preparing an area for contract timber removal using advanced logging systems, however, has not been studied. The impacts of the extra time and extra manpower required for this process are large and they are important impacts which need to be taken into consideration during crew work planning. This is difficult to do since the factors which affect crew manhours have not been defined. The objectives of this paper are to determine which factors affect the number of manhours spent on the presale fieldwork portion of preparing a U. S. D. A. Forest Service timber sale for contract; to compare presale field work time on conventional and special-design sales; and to develop a methodology for predicting presale fieldwork time. Previous studies suggest some factors which affect forestry work, but the quantitative changes in production caused by each factor have not been measured. Logging operation research and human engineering studies report that the following factors affect production: underbrush, topography, weather, heat, cold, muscle fatigue, motivation, the work-rest period, tobacco, and alcohol. Motivation is often an overriding factor which outweighs all other considerations. Motivation was not measured in this study, but it was expected to have some effect on the results. Topography, underbrush, and weather were expected {{to be the most important}} variables for predicting manhours. Data or presale fieldwork time were collected from 16 districts on eight National Forests in Oregon and Washington, using a form designed to simplify data collection and coding for computer input. The form was a daily work record which could be easily filled out in a few minutes by the field crew. District personnel on each of the 16 districts were personally contacted about cooperating in the study, but they were not pressured to collect data even if they agreed to cooperate. The sample was designed to collect a distribution of data from the coast, eastside, and Cascade areas respectively, but most data collected came from the Cascade area. Activity categories for data collection included layout, traverse, marking,cruising, skyline profile, wildlife related activity, land line retracement, spur road traverse, spur road location, and timber stand examination. The data were separated by activity and by complete units, and were analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression program. Variables found to increase the number of manhours required for presale fieldwork were acres, boundary sinuosity, and silvicultural treatment. The significant variables which reduced manhours were landscape management designation and the distance walked from the vehicle to the unit. These two variables had been expected to increase manhours, but the effect of motivation may have been the cause for the unexpected reverse of sign on the regression coefficients. Special design designation showed no significant effect on manhours except through boundary sinuosity. The regression equations recommended for use in predicting manhours are for the activities of layout using on-the-ground <b>aerial</b> photo-interpretation; <b>traverse</b> using a hand compass, clinometer, and chain; marking of leave trees; cruising by the variable plot method; and for the Cascade area complete units. Nomographs are provided for the solution of these regression equations...|$|R
