5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater breeds in monogamous pairs in <b>a</b> <b>breeding</b> {{season that}} extends from July to March, with {{migrating}} birds nesting later than sedentary birds. They nest solitarily in all-purpose territories that both parents defend against conspecifics {{and other species}} including thornbills, spinebills, and silvereyes, although the male is involved in more aggressive interactions than the female. Within <b>a</b> <b>breeding</b> season females lay two or three clutches of eggs, re-nesting with the same partner in the same territory. Banded birds {{have been identified in}} the same territory for periods of up to five years.|$|E
