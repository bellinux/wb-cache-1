5|$|Arizona Proposition 107 – On November 7, 2006, Arizona {{rejected}} <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning {{same-sex marriage}} and civil unions by 52% of the vote. Two years later Arizona voters approved a more narrow amendment banning only same-sex marriage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the Civil War, Union lawmakers debated various {{proposals}} for Reconstruction. Some of these called for <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to abolish slavery nationally and permanently. On December 14, 1863, a bill proposing such an amendment was introduced by Representative James Mitchell Ashley of Ohio. Representative James F. Wilson of Iowa soon followed with a similar proposal. On January 11, 1864, Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri submitted a joint resolution for <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> abolishing slavery. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Lyman Trumbull of Illinois, became involved in merging different proposals for an amendment.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota Amendment 1 – On November 6, 2012, Minnesota {{rejected}} <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> banning {{gay marriage}} with 53% {{of the electorate}} opposed. A majority of all votes cast {{would be required to}} amend the state constitution.|$|E

5|$|Changes in Directive Principles require <b>a</b> <b>Constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{which has}} to be passed by a special {{majority}} of both houses of the Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting and by the absolute majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|Changes to the {{fundamental}} rights require <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament. This means that an amendment requires the approval of two-thirds of the members present and voting. However, the number of members voting should not be less than the simple majority of the house – whether the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Ford {{supported}} <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> against desegregation busing. He also floated {{a proposal}} to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), {{he was chairman of}} the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} saw as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with the elections in Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E
5|$|Michigan was {{admitted}} to the Union on January 26, 1837. The original 1835 Constitution of Michigan provided for the election of a governor and a lieutenant governor every 2 years. The fourth and current constitution of 1963 increased this term to four years. There was no term limit on governors until <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> effective in 1993 limited governors to two terms.|$|E
5|$|Ministry of Interior {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> on 15 December 2016 {{aimed at}} providing {{constitutional right to}} acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing {{the right to be}} armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.|$|E
50|$|The {{constitution}} includes {{transitional provisions}} intended {{to remain in}} force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes <b>an</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> is enacted once in every ten years.|$|R

5|$|Following Baehr v. Lewin, a 1993 {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of Hawaii that found the state's refusal to grant same-sex couples marriage licenses discriminatory, voters in 1998 approved <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> granting the Hawaii State Legislature the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, and the legislature passed a law banning same-sex marriage. Civil unions were not restricted. Bills creating civil unions were considered several times, but failed to receive committee approval prior to 2009.|$|E
5|$|Frank E. Holman, {{president}} of the American Bar Association (ABA), called attention to Federal court decisions, notably Missouri v. Holland, which he claimed could give international treaties and agreements precedence over the United States Constitution and {{could be used by}} foreigners to threaten American liberties. Senator Bricker was influenced by the ABA's work and first introduced <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> in 1951. With substantial popular support and the election of a Republican president and Congress in the elections of 1952, together with support from many Southern Democrats, Bricker's plan seemed destined to be sent to the individual states for ratification.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> to allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher {{by a vote of}} 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|President Carlos Menem sought <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{to allow}} his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The {{victory in the}} 1993 midterm {{elections}} strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed {{a referendum on the}} amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for a law that would allow <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem's proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its own mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando delaRúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR got only 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso, when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens to put <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> {{to a national}} vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference {{on the ballot in}} case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E

5|$|The 1776 {{constitution}} {{provided that}} the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who {{was president of the}} Council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. <b>A</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment</b> in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor, and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment,</b> rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
5|$|The Tribunal {{consists}} of {{not less than}} three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since the Tribunal was established in 1994, to date only one constitutional question {{has been referred to}} it. The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through <b>a</b> <b>constitutional</b> <b>amendment.</b> Since then, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E
