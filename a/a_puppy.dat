By the end of August 2013, a new puppy had been identified from the same breeders, and John B. Carroll was introduced to the campus in October 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} for ectropion {{varies depending on}} {{the severity of the}} condition. The only {{treatment for}} entropion is surgical, and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst <b>a</b> <b>puppy</b> the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as entropion or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of <b>a</b> <b>puppy,</b> but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are surprised when they receive <b>a</b> <b>puppy</b> instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E

5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when <b>a</b> <b>puppy</b> is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
5|$|Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, {{much to his}} delight. Jess becomes {{angry with}} his father's {{attitude}} to him, and refuses the existence of Terabithia {{the next day at}} school. Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her <b>a</b> <b>puppy,</b> whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'.

Once Leslie's parents finish their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school, Leslie discovers from an upset Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and they become friends and later Janice becomes Jess' friend.

When it starts raining, they decide to go home, and Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, <b>a</b> <b>puppy</b> biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several of remarkable design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E

25|$|The Neapolitan Mastiff {{has a low}} {{activity}} level, even as <b>a</b> <b>puppy.</b> Visits to dog parks {{should be}} minimal, considering they can be aggressive to other dogs they are not familiar with.

25|$|Like most dogs, Great Danes require daily {{walks to}} {{maintain}} their health. However, {{it is important not}} to over exercise this breed, particularly when young.
