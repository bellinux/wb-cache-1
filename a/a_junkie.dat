[...] The song ends abruptly with the words, [...] "Every time I see you, I just don't know what to do."

He wrote that [...] "just when we feel we've escaped with minor scratches", Timberlake repeats the line [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>junkie</b> for your love" [...] ad nauseam [...] "until the song reaches its merciful resolution". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] begins [...] "perky enough", but that is [...] "hard to justify" [...] its length when it feels repetitive after the first three minutes and [...] "self-indulgent thereafter". HitFix reviewer Melinda Newman was critical of the lyric [...] "hydroponic jelly bean", commenting: [...] "Is there anyone else on God's green earth that could pull off calling someone that?" ...|$|E

500|$|During the Hanover Quay {{sessions}} in 2008, Bono {{indicated that he}} had become [...] "tired of [...] the first-person", leading him to write songs {{from the perspective of}} different characters. He invented [...] "a traffic cop, <b>a</b> <b>junkie</b> [...] a soldier serving in Afghanistan." [...] Although each character tells a personal story, the underlying theme of the album is peripheral vision, events taking place in the wider world, [...] "just at the edges". Bono described it as [...] "central to the understanding of this album". Nevertheless, as the characters narrate there is an intentional [...] "shutting out" [...] of the wider world, so that the focus remains on their [...] "personal epiphanies". The narrative the group originally planned for the album was broken up in the sessions' final weeks with their changes to the track listing. Bono revealed that numbers were significant in many of the songs, and that the album was split into thirds; he described the first section as [...] "a whole world unto itself, and you get to a very ecstatic place", and the second as [...] "a load of singles". The final third is composed of songs that are [...] "unusual territory" [...] for the band.|$|E
500|$|Rossen filmed The Hustler {{over six}} weeks, entirely in New York City. Much {{of the action}} was filmed at two now-defunct pool halls, McGirr's and Ames Billiard Academy. Other {{shooting}} locations included a townhouse on East 82nd Street, which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton's character Findley, and the Manhattan Greyhound bus terminal. The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders. Willie Mosconi served as technical advisor on the film and shot {{a number of the}} trick shots in place of the actors. All of Gleason's shots were his own; they were filmed in wide-angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames. Rossen, in pursuit of the style he termed [...] "neo-neo-realistic", hired actual street thugs, enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras. Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie {{is on his way to}} town (originally slated to be the first scene of the film) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny's Bar which establishes Preacher is <b>a</b> <b>junkie.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{naming of}} Kurt Hectic was {{inspired}} by two disparate sources.

2500|$|The {{last major}} relapse was instigated {{by a doctor}} {{prescribing}} him Ultram despite Kiedis specifically asking for drugs {{that are not in}} the opiate family. To a recovering heroin addict, the synthetic opiate gives rise to strong cravings. He has reportedly avoided another relapse since December 24, 2000. [...] "It's easy to be <b>a</b> <b>junkie,</b> but it's not easy {{to be one of the}} best guitarists or songwriters of all time", Kiedis said, referring to John Frusciante, in the March 2007 issue of Blender. After over twenty years of speculation, in May 2012 Vulture Magazine stated that the location where Kiedis would purchase and use drugs and that inspired [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is located in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, California, based on clues taken from Kiedis' memoir. In 2014, LA Weekly strongly asserted that the conclusion of the Vulture Magazine piece is not correct. Kiedis has refused to divulge the location.|$|E
2500|$|Comics, {{especially}} the crime/horror titles pioneered by EC Comics, were not lacking in gruesome images; Wertham reproduced these extensively, pointing {{out what he}} saw as recurring morbid themes such as [...] "injury to the eye" [...] (as depicted in Plastic Man creator Jack Cole's [...] "Murder, Morphine and Me", which he illustrated and probably wrote for publisher Magazine Village's True Crime Comics #2 (May 1947); it involved dope-dealing protagonist Mary Kennedy nearly getting stabbed in the eye [...] "by <b>a</b> <b>junkie</b> with a hypodermic needle" [...] in her dream sequence). Many of his other conjectures, particularly about hidden sexual themes (e.g. images of female nudity concealed in drawings of muscles and tree bark, or Batman and Robin as gay partners), were met with derision within the comics industry. (Wertham's claim that Wonder Woman had a bondage subtext was somewhat better documented, as her creator William Moulton Marston had admitted as much; however, Wertham also claimed that Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian.) Citing one of Wertham's arguments, that 95% of children in reform school read comics proves that comics cause juvenile delinquency (this {{is an example of the}} well-known logical fallacy correlation implies causation), Stan Lee recounted that Wertham [...] "said things that impressed the public, and it was like shouting fire in a theater, but there was little scientific validity to it. And yet because he had the name doctor people took what he said seriously, and it started a whole crusade against comics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mayfield's {{first solo}} album, Curtis, was {{released}} in 1970, and hit the top 20, {{as well as being}} a critical success. It pre-dated Marvin Gaye's album, What's Going On, which it has been compared to. The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with Super Fly, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation Super Fly film. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes' score for Shaft), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield's lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in Rolling Stone magazine in 1972 that while the film's message [...] "was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes" [...] because it [...] "glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [...] is far stronger and more definite than in the film." [...] Because of the tendency of these blaxploitation films to glorify the criminal life of dealers and pimps in order to target a mostly black lower class audience, Mayfield's album set this movie apart. With songs like [...] "Freddie's Dead", a song that focuses on the demise of Freddie, <b>a</b> <b>junkie</b> that was forced into [...] "pushin' dope for the man" [...] because of a debt that he owed to his dealer, and [...] "Pusherman", a song that reveals how many people in the ghetto fell victim to drug abuse, and therefore became dependent upon their dealers, Mayfield illuminated a darker side of life in the ghetto that these blaxploitation films often failed to criticize. However, although Mayfield's soundtrack criticized the glorification of dealers and pimps, he in no way denied that this glorification was occurring. When asked about the subject matter of these films he was quoted stating [...] "I don’t see why people are complaining about the subject of these films”, and “The way you clean up the films is by cleaning up the streets.” ...|$|E
