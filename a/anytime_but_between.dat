These mobile nodes can form a network anywhere and at <b>anytime.</b> <b>But</b> the topology {{of the network}} thereby formed will be unpredictable due to frequent node movement. For sending data to destination, source node can send directly or can forward via an intermediate node depending upon the range of destination node. Since security {{is a major concern}} in ad-hoc network, secure routing algorithm is essential for MANET. Even if there are different algorithms to prevent selfishness in MANET and thereby to make routing in ad-hoc network secure, they have their own disadvantages. This paper explores the concept of a new algorithm which is an enhanced version of the existing FACES Algorithm that routes data on the basis of trust. The Trust is evaluated by conducting a Challenge scheme. This is an efficient scheme that can isolate malicious nodes and also it can make them trust worthy. This algorithm is also having several other significances. This paper will also make a study of the existing routing scheme FACES. Keywords-MANET; malicious; Challenge I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{widespread}} {{diffusion of}} wireless-enabled portable de-vices creates novel opportunities for users to share resources anywhere and <b>anytime,</b> <b>but</b> makes access control a crucial issue. User/device mo-bility and heterogeneity, together with network topology and conditions variability, complicate access control {{and call for}} novel solutions to dy-namically adapt access decisions to the different operating conditions. Several research efforts have emerged {{in recent years that}} propose to ex-ploit context-awareness to control access to resources based on context visibility and changes. Context-based access control requires, however, {{to take into account the}} quality of context information used to drive access decisions (QoC). Quality of context has in fact a profound im-pact on the correct behavior of any context-aware access control frame-work. Using context information with insufficient quality might increase the risk of incorrect access control decisions, thus leading to danger-ous security breaches in resource sharing. In this paper we propose a QoC-aware approach to access control for anywhere, anytime resource sharing. The paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of the Proteus policy framework, which combines two design guidelines to enable dynamic adaptation of policies depending on context changes: context-awareness with QoC guarantees and semantic technologies to al-low high-level description of context/policy specification and reasoning about context/policies. ...|$|R
