40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the data obtained by}} atomic emission spectrometric analy-sis after ultrasonic extraction, destructive analysis of some certified rock samples em-ploying ultrasonic waves was applied to two elements, Na and K, and the recovery rates were defined. The recovery ratio as K 1 = CULM/CCRM was defined for the ultrasonic leaching method (CULM) and the certified reference materials (CRMs). Another recov-ery ratio, K 2 was also defined from the results of the conventional dissolution method (CCDM), that is K 2, CULM/CCDM. The accuracy and precision of the method were com-parable with those of the conventional methods. The obtained recoveries were between 90. 0 % < K 1, Na < 106. 1 and 90. 0 % < K 2, Na < 103. 0 % for Na and 92. 3 % < K 1, K < 103. 2 and 92. 3 % <K 2,K < 104. 5 % for K.

40|$|In this work, superparamagnetic nanoparticle-decorated {{graphene}} (MG) sheets were synthesized {{and used}} as support for hemimicelles/admicelles for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of different compounds from environmental water samples for the first time. The MG sheets were facilely synthesized by a one-step, one-pot redox reaction between graphene oxide and Fe(I I). Due to the large surface area and unique nanosheet morphology, MG served as an excellent nano-scaled support material for hemimicelles and admicelles. exhibiting higher loading capacity than conventional materials and pure Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. The MG sheets could be negatively or positively charged depending on solution pH, allowing the extraction to be conducted in different modes. In cationic mode, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used as micelle-forming reagent, and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and alkylphenols were used as model analytes. In anionic mode, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used as micelle-forming reagent and alkyltrimethylammonium salts were selected as analytes. In both modes, the formation processes of hemimicelles/admicelles on MG sheets were studied and the extraction conditions were optimized. For PFASs, the analytical sensitivity was enhanced by 50 - 113 -fold by the extraction, and the method detection limits (MDLs) ranged from 0. 15 to 0. 50 ng/L. For alkyltrimethylammonium salts, the MDLs were {{in the range of}} 1. 4 - 8. 0 ng/L. In both modes, good recoveries (56. 3 - 93. 9 %) and reproducibility (run-to-run RSDs < 9. 3 %) were obtained.

40|$|For {{the first}} time, germania-based hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel {{materials}} were developed for <b>analytical</b> <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> and chromatographic separation. Being an isostructural analog of silica (SiO 2), germania (GeO 2) {{is compatible with}} silica network. This structural similarity, which is reflected by the relative positions of germanium and silicon in the periodic table, stimulated our investigation {{on the development of}} germania-based sol-gel hybrid organic-inorganic coatings for analytical applications. Sol-gel sorbents and stationary phases reported to date are predominantly silica-based. Poor pH stability of silica-based materials is a major drawback. In this work, this problem was addressed through development of germania-based organic-inorganic hybrid sol-gel materials. For this, tetramethoxygermane (TMOG) and tetraethyoxygermane (TEOG) were used as precursors to create a sol-gel network via hydrolytic polycondensation reactions to provide the inorganic component (germania) of the organic-inorganic hybrid coating. The growing sol-gel germania network was simultaneously reacted with an organic ligand that contained sol-gel-active sites in its chemical structure. Hydroxy-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and 3 -cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES) served as sources of nonpolar and polar organic components, respectively. The sol-gel reactions were performed within fused silica capillaries. The prepared sol-gel germania coatings were found to provide excellent pH and thermal stability. Their extraction characteristics remained practically unchanged after continuous rinsing of the sol-gel germania-PDMS capillary for 24 hours with highly basic (pH= 13) and/or acidic (pH = 1. 3) solution. They were very efficient in extracting non-polar and moderately polar analytes such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones. Possessing the polar cyanopropyl moiety, sol-gel germania cyanopropyl-PDMS capillaries were found to effectively extract polar analytes such as alcohols, fatty acids, and phenols. Besides, they also showed superior thermal stability compared with commercial cyano-PDMS coatings thanks to the covalent attachment of the coating to capillary surface achieved through sol-gel technology. Their extraction characteristics remained unchanged up to 330 °C which is significantly higher than the maximum operation temperature (3 ̆c 280 °C) for commercial cyano-PDMS coatings. Low ng/L detection limits were achieved for both non-polar and polar test solutes. Our preliminary results also indicated that sol-gel hybrid germania coatings have the potential to offer great analytical performance as GC stationary phases...|$|E

The effect of {{high or low}} levels of trace metals in human tissues has been studied widely. There have been detectable significant variations in the concentrations of tracemetals in normal and cancerous tissues suggesting that these variations could be a causative factor to various cancers. Even though essential tracemetals {{play an important role}} such as stabilizers, enzyme cofactors, elements of structure, and essential elements for normal hormonal functions, their imbalanced toxic effects contribute to the rate of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and formation of complexities in the body cells which may lead to DNA damage. The induction of oxidative-induced DNA damage by ROSmay lead to isolated base lesions or single-strand breaks, complex lesions like double-strand breaks, and some oxidative generated clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs) which are linked to cell apoptosis and mutagenesis. The difference in published works on the level of variations of trace metals in different cancer tissues {{can be attributed to the}} accuracy of the <b>analytical</b> techniques, <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> methods, and inability of taking uniform samples from the affected tissues. This paper reviews comparative trace elemental concentrations of cancerous and noncancerous tissues using PIXE that has been reported in the published literature. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general screening method, based on liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), for the simultaneous detection in human urine of 72 xenobiotics (21 diuretics, 16 synthetic glucocorticoids, 17 beta-adrenergic drugs, 10 stimulants, 5 anti-oestrogens and 3 anabolic steroids), excreted free or as glucuro-conjugates in urine. Although the method has been specifically designed and evaluated {{in view of}} its potential application to anti-doping analyses, {{it can also be}} effective in other areas of <b>analytical</b> toxicology. <b>Sample</b> <b>preparation</b> was based on two liquid/liquid separation steps (performed at alkaline and at acid pH, respectively) of hydrolyzed human urine, and then an assay by LC/MS-MS in positive and negative ionization mode using an electrospray ionization source (ESI) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) as the acquisition mode. The overall time needed for an LC run was less than 15 minutes. All compounds showed good reproducibility in terms of both the retention times (CV%< 1) and the relative abundances of the diagnostic transitions (CV%< 10). The limits of detection (LOD) were in the range of 1 - 50 ng/mL for glucocorticoids, anti-oestrogens and steroids, and 50 - 500 ng/mL for diuretics, beta-adrenergic drugs and stimulants, thus satisfying the minimum required performance limits (MRPL) set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the accredited anti-doping laboratories...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{degradation}} processes play {{an important}} role in chemical water clearance taking place in river sediments. Bacteria remove not only easily degradable organic species, but various xenobiotics as well, producing clear and xenobiotic free water for bank-filtered wells. Atrazine is a widely used herbicide, and it is one of the most common xenobiotics present in Danube water. In this study the pathway and kinetics of atrazine metabolism of sedimental microbiota. were studied. Samples were collected from river sediment and from pure microbial growth cultures. An <b>analytical</b> scheme including <b>sample</b> <b>preparation,</b> chromatography and mass spectrometry was developed and optimised. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was found to be satisfactory for <b>sample</b> <b>preparation.</b> For qualitative analysis of samples both reversed-phase and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) methods were developed and used. Selectivity, detection limits and accuracy of the two methods were compared. Using this analytical scheme, the full atrazine metabolism of the organism Comamonas acidovorans was explored. Altogether, 12 metabolites were identified from the original compound to the urea end product. Detection limits in the range of 50 ng L- 1 - 1 mug L- 1 were obtained for different metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Domoic acid (DA), a {{neurotoxic}} {{amino acid}} produced by diatoms, {{is the main}} cause of amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). In this work, we propose a very simple and fast analytical method to determine DA in mussel tissue. The method consists of two consecutive extractions and requires no purification steps, due to a reduction of the extraction of the interfering species and the application of very sensitive and selective HILIC-MS/MS method. The procedural method was validated through the estimation of trueness, extract yield, precision, detection, and quantification limits of <b>analytical</b> method. The <b>sample</b> <b>preparation</b> was also evaluated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the matrix effect. These evaluations were conducted both on the DA-free matrix spiked with known DA concentration and on the reference certified material (RCM). We developed a very selective LC-MS/MS method with a very low value of method detection limit (9 [*]ng[*]g− 1) without cleanup steps...|$|R
