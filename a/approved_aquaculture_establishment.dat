The National Organic Standards Board <b>approved</b> the <b>aquaculture</b> standards in 2007 and reconsidered the aquatic animal feed and facilities until they synthesized the public commentary in 2008.

40|$|Dicathais orbita is a predatory marine whelk of {{interest}} {{as a new}} source of protein for potential production in <b>aquaculture.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of a successful aquaculture industry based on this species will require optimisation of their diet for fast growth and survival, whilst maintaining a good proximate composition in the flesh. Here we compare the effects of four diets fed to juvenile D. orbita over a 12 week period, to evaluate consumption, feed conversion, growth rates, mortalities and proximate composition. It was found that diet impacts significantly on the growth and survival rates of this whelk, with bivalve feeds resulting in significantly higher consumption (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and growth rates (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) compared to artificial pellets, despite similar feed conversion ratios (P = 0. 359). The artificial pellets were found to have significantly less moisture, but higher protein, glycogen and lipid content than the bivalve feeds (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and resulted in whelk flesh with significantly higher energy and ash content (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). D. orbita showed a preference for scavenging frozen bivalves over predation on live molluscs in captivity, which could reflect an optimal foraging strategy to minimise the energy required to subdue prey. Overall, juvenile D. orbita display similar growth (up to 0. 8 g/month) and high survival (3 ̆e 90...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceuticals are {{considered}} as emerging pollutants {{of particular concern}} due to their continuous release into {{the environment and the}} potential impact on aquatic organisms. The selection of the target compounds for evaluation in fish tissue was based on physico-chemical properties, bioaccumulation potential and the results of the screening of pharmaceuticals in the effluent of WWTP Sevnica in March 2015. We chose tramadol, risperidone, desipramine, carbamazepine, irbesartan, naproxen, valsartan, atorvastatin, triclosan, simvastatin and diclofenac. The method was developed on muscle tissue and is based on the tissue homogenization with stainless steel beads, followed by extraction with acetonitrile, centrifugation and sample clean-up with solid-phase extraction (SPE). The instrumental analysis was performed with LC-MS/MS. The best and the most reproducible recoveries were observed for the samples that were diluted to 25 mL with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7. The method was validated and the linearity range was established, which was in the range of 0. 1 – 1000 ng/g, depending of the compound. The recoveries for the target pharmaceuticals were in the range of 24. 0 – 108. 5 %, with good reproducibility as the relative RSD values for all compounds were below 7. 5 %. LOQ values for the compounds were in the 0. 1 – 50 ng/g range. We applied the method to the fish tissue samples from the river Sava and from the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>establishment.</b> We chose muscle, liver, skin and kidney tissue samples.

In this preliminary study behavioral response was used to assess potential correlations with PAA dosage. A behavioral change or response is not necessarily an indication of compromised welfare. Supportive enzymatic, biochemical and physiological biomarkers can be used along with gill and epidermal histological measures to evaluate the effects on water treatment regimens. The ultimate goal is to define the therapeutic window where fish welfare is not compromised. PAA is among the few disinfectants <b>approved</b> for organic <b>aquaculture.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The farming of {{penaeid shrimps}} in Cambodia began in 1989 and has {{significantly}} expanded since 1991. Shrimp cultivation {{has been carried}} out in the four coastal provinces, i. e. Kampot, Kep, Preah Sihanouk Ville, and Koh Kong. Black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg shrimp (P. vannamei) are the main species being cultured extensively and intensively in brackishwater ponds in Kampot, Kep, and Preah Sihanouk Ville, and Koh Kong, respectively. Extensive shrimp ponds were constructed close to the mangrove areas with some containing mangroves within the pond and stocking density ranging from 5, 000 to 20, 000 postlarvae/ha. However, the productivity remains low at > 100 kg/ ha/ year. On the contrary, intensive culture has a stocking density ranging from 300, 000 to 500, 000 postlarvae/ha. While high cost of investment for farm establishment, pond construction and farm operation are required, productions of newly established farms have reached 7 to 8 metric tons (MT) /ha per crop. The occurrence of white spot disease, monodon baculovirus disease, and yellow head disease was first reported in 1999 among cultured P. monodon in Koh Kong province causing a number of farmers to stop the intensive cultivation of black tiger shrimp. To date, only a small proportion of shrimp farmers have ventured into extensive shrimp farming with approximately 10 ha of shrimp areas currently in operation. To mitigate the negative impacts of shrimp diseases and promote the expansion of the shrimp industry in Cambodia, development of a national reporting system for aquatic animal diseases; capacity building for detection, monitoring and disease surveillance; creation of National Guidelines On Good Shrimp <b>Aquaculture</b> Practices; <b>establishment</b> of subresearch centers and concomitant funding support for marine aquaculture development and extension services; establishment of local shrimp hatcheries and provision of hands-on trainings for farmers; and strengthening collaborations among provincial officers, researchers and farmers network should be accordingly instituted...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mortality}} during fish {{early life}} stages {{is a major}} bottleneck in <b>aquaculture.</b> Therefore, the <b>establishment</b> of methods to prevent and control diseases, to ensure efficient growth and to reach maximal survival rates is mandatory to optimize the productivity. A promising solution can be the early activation {{of the immune system}} by administration of probiotics as nutritional supplements. In our study we assess the effect of the probiotic candidate Bacillus subtilis on the innate and adaptive immune response of juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Therefore, Artemia nauplii were used as live carriers to feed B. subtilis to 3 -month-old sea bass over a period of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the juveniles were fed another week without administering B. subtilis in order to estimate the bacterial mucus-binding ability. During the course of the experiment, we evaluated direct effects on the cellular immune response by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and on survival. As a next step we will determine profiles of immune gene expression. To estimate cellular stress, the expression level of metabolism- and stress-related genes will be measured. Furthermore, the RNA/DNA ratio as an indicator of growth will be analysed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} novel {{experimental}} technique to investigate the effect of sound on the behavior of various cultured species of fish, at first, and subsequently to demonstrate the usefulness of this effect. Three species are investigated: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and red porgy (Pagrus pagrus). A digital imaging system was developed to monitor fish position in 2 dimensions as a function of time. The system includes 2 dedicated software packages for the storage and analysis of the data directly on a laptop and can be connected to a sound production system including a sound generator, an amplifier and a water-proof loudspeaker set in the water. Altogether, these constitute a portable, water-proof, easily-used instrument {{for the study of the}} effect of sound on fish behavior, and it was successfully tested in a small tank, large tank, sea cage, and in the field. The contrast of the image can be adjusted according to lighting conditions. The data-collection software records the positions of the fish as a function of time (every 1 / 15 of a second). The instrument can also operate with a portable, rechargeable battery. The experiments were conducted in a) a small tank (110 l) with 2 populations of S. aurata (gilthead seabream) weighing 5. 2 g and 12. 0 g respectively, 1 population of D. labrax (seabass) (~ 1. 6 g) and 1 population of P. pagrus (red porgy) (~ 1. 7 g) b) a large tank (10 m 3) with a population of S. aurata (~ 250 g) c) in a sea cage of an <b>aquaculture</b> <b>establishment</b> with a population of S. aurata (~ 150 g), and d) the Amvrakikos gulf (Menidi) after the release of the population of S. aurata being in the sea cage. The method of the conditioned response was applied, whereby the new stimulus, the sound, is followed by a reward: feeding. In the small tank, experiments were conducted at 6 different frequencies (100, 200, 500, 800, 1250, and 2500 Hz), and additionally also at 5000 Hz for the gilthead seabream, and at 5 levels of sound (- 62, - 42, - 32, - 20 και - 10 dBu). In the large tank, experiments were conducted with 3 different frequencies (200, 500, and 800 Hz), and at 1 level of sound (- 20 dBu), but also using sound with the timbre from 4 different groups of instruments: strings, woodwind, percussion, and electric instruments. In the sea cage, experiments were conducted with 5 different frequencies (100, 200, 500, 800, and 1250 Hz) and at 1 level of sound (- 10 dBu), whereas in the gulf 3 frequencies were used (100, 200, and 500 Hz) at - 10 dBu. The response to the sound was judged by the location of the fish with respect to the sound source before, during, and after production of sound. A positive response was observed for all three species of fish and in all developmental stages studied. The aggregation of the fish at the point of feeding is judged as a positive response. In the experimental setup used for most measurements, the feeding point and the sound source were located closely to each other. However, when the sound source was moved to other locations within the tank, the gilthead seabream located it both optically and by sound (during operation). A positive response was obtained more often when the feeding was accompanied or immediately followed by the sound and in that case a sound burst lasting 15 - 30 s was ideal. We determine that D. labrax and S. aurata are “hearing generalists” (non-specialists), that is they respond positively at low frequencies until 800 Hz. P. pagrus responded positively only at 500 Ηz. The responses are independent of the sound levels in the small tank. In the large tank we chose to use our loudest setting only. Sounds from musical instruments produce a positive response on fish which have been previously conditioned at a single frequency. However, fish did not respond, when music was played in the air (not transmitted with the underwater loudspeaker). The response to the sound is affected by abiotic factors (especially in the field), but not by the time of day. The change in behavior caused by the application of the sound pulses in the small tank appears between the 2 nd and the 4 th day of the experiments, with a progressive improvement of the response as long as the conditioning is going on. For the gilthead seabeam positive responses can be observed even after 1 month without any stimulation. The change in behavior caused by sound stimulus in the large tank appears on the 4 th day of the experiment and is not affected by the change to the other two frequencies tested. In the sea cage a weak response was observed on the 3 rd day, which, however, was not repeated on subsequent days, likely due to the abiotic factors. [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Parasitic {{diseases}} in European aquaculture continue to pose economic and ecological threats to farmed and wild fish populations. The primary infection with ectoparasites can {{open the door}} to secondary or super- infections caused by bacterial and viral pathogens. Specifically, the infection with Argulus foliaceus (fish louse) in freshwater cyprinid fish such as common carp (Cyprinuscarpio) can increase production losses in affected aquaculture operations, or stocked water bodies. However, current veterinary drug use regulations in Germany limit the range of medications approved as treatment against ectoparasites in freshwater fish. A comparable parasite Lepeoptheirussalmonis (salmon louse) treatment with Diflubenzuron, Ivermectin and Doramectin (pesticides), has been <b>approved</b> in Salmon <b>aquaculture</b> in various countries. In order to control parasite populations, fish farmers frequently reach for non-approved but available treatments without veterinary supervision, possibly leading to consequences such as environmental damage, emergence of drug resistance or unwanted side effects on cultured and wild fish. The focus {{of this study is to}} investigate possible side effects of Diflubenzuron, Ivermectin, and Doramectin treatments on the innate immune system of a cyprinide fish. The overall research objective is to determine which antiparasitic drug and in what concentration and dose would present an effective treatment of the A. foliaceus without causing measurable side effects on fish neutrophil function. The first specific aim was to determine in vitro effects of commercial formulations of diflubenzuron, ivermectin and doramectin on fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) neutrophil function. Treatment effects in vitro on oxidative burst, degranulation, and neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) release were studied. Application of ivermectin and doramectin (in estimated plasma concentrations of 308 and 125 ng/ml respectively) caused no significant stimulation of oxidative burst, degranulation of primary granules and NETs release. However, application of diflubenzuron (in estimated plasma concentrations of 200 ng/ml) caused a significant stimulation of oxidative burst. Diflubenzuron treated neutrophils showed up to three time’s higher activity than the non-treated control. The second specific aim of the study was establishing a cell culture protocol of fathead minnow liver, spleen and kidney cells. In order to examine whether an incubation of the cells in culture of 48 hours with Diflubenzuron would alter the RNA expression in these organs, no significant change in expression of the tested genes (glutathione reductase, glutathione synthase, catalase, glutathione-s-transferase, catalase and CYP A 1) compared to a control could be proven. The observed effect indicates that the tested antiparasitic compounds have the potential to interfere with disease resistance in fish populations by modulating immune responses during treatment. Therefore, further study is required to find optimal therapeutic dose for effective and safe treatment against ectoparasites in cyprinide fish. The following conclusions can be drawn from the presented findings: In vitro studies on the innate immune system as the here presented neutrophil studies can give reliable first answers to questions concerning in vivo diseases and treatments. With studies on the gene expression, far-reaching and profound negative effects can be ruled out, when such investigations remain without significant results, as shown here...|$|R
