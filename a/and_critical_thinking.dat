The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the practices, understanding <b>and</b> application of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in the lives of learners, educators and parents. The research was conducted in the grade seven classes of three schools in the Western Cape. These schools are representative of the demography of the Western Cape. Initial questionnaires were sent to parents of the grade seven learners in this study to determine whether the home environment encourages <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>and</b> whether or not the parents practice <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in their home and personal lives. An interview was conducted with the 8 teachers of each grade seven class at the three schools, to determine their understanding of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking,</b> whether they use <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> in their personal capacity, and whether they nurture <b>and</b> teach <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Each learner completed a questionnaire to determine his or her knowledge <b>and</b> understanding of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking,</b> prior to teaching and learning interventions. The interventions occurred through a series of teaching/learning activities, and participative action research to facilitate the learning, understanding <b>and</b> application of <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> Data was obtained from observation throughout intervention as well as from a final questionnaire {{at the end of the}} teaching/ learning activities.

25|$|A {{key part}} of the Scripps {{experience}} is the Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Studies, a sequence of three classes that encourage students to think critically and challenge ideas. Every first-year student takes Core I in the fall, which introduces students to major ideas that shape the modern world. Core II seminars focus on specific ideas introduced in Core I and are usually team-taught by two professors in different fields, such as physics and art. The concluding Core III classes encourage discussion <b>and</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> for first-semester sophomores, culminating in individual projects that often lead to students' senior thesis or project.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement <b>and</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking.</b> The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” {{provides an example of}} how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E

To proceed to the droid factory, the player must complete eight training missions and four top-secret missions with task-specific requirements, Such as 'Droid must be magnetic, Droid {{must be able to}} see in the dark, or Droid must weigh less than 100 kilograms. This allows you to complete the mission. Through experiential learning, players learn about and apply the scientific principles of energy, force, light, engineering, and magnetism. In addition, the game encourages players to apply math, logic, <b>and</b> <b>critical</b> <b>thinking</b> skills. The game contains 87 droid parts which can be combined in 25 million different combinations for manufacturing. In the Jawa Droid Workshop, players can paint and name their creations, and make them dance, while a holographic design grid lets players have a 360 degree view of their work in progress. In in-game InDex provided players with encyclopedic explanations on the science used in the game to help players; it could also link to the internet for access to further links.|$|E

The multiple-mini interview has consistently shown to have a higher predictive validity for future performance than traditional interviews. The multiple-mini interview process has since been adopted by the majority of Canadian medical schools, {{as well as a number}} of medical schools in the United States. In 2010, the medical school developed the Computer-based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics, in order to better assess the personal characteristics of the applicant.
