5|$|<b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> against malaria called RTS,S, was {{approved}} by European regulators in 2015. It is undergoing pilot trials in select countries in 2016.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{developed in}} mice may provide insight into providing <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by scrapie prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|Decreased {{levels of}} retinoic acid {{in the skin}} may {{contribute}} to comedo formation. To address this deficiency, methods to increase the skin's production of retinoid acid are being explored. <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.|$|E
40|$|As {{history has}} demonstrated, post-approval {{obstacles}} can impede <b>a</b> <b>vaccine's</b> use and potentially lead to its withdrawal. Addressing these potential obstacles when changes in <b>a</b> <b>vaccine's</b> technology {{can still be}} easily made may improve <b>a</b> <b>vaccine's</b> chances of success. Augmented vaccine target product profiles (TPPs) can help vaccine scientists better understand and anticipate these obstacles and galvanize conversations among various vaccine stakeholders (e. g., scientists, marketers, business development managers, policy makers, public health officials, health care workers, third party payors, etc.) earlier in <b>a</b> <b>vaccine's</b> development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|While at Wyeth, Siber {{oversaw the}} {{development}} and approval of several often used vaccines for children, including Prevnar, <b>a</b> pneumococcal <b>vaccine,</b> Acel-Imune, <b>an</b> acellular pertussis <b>vaccine,</b> Meningitec, <b>a</b> meningococcal meningitis <b>vaccine,</b> Rotashield, <b>a</b> rotavirus <b>vaccine,</b> and FluMist, <b>a</b> nasal spray influenza vaccine.|$|R
5|$|Craig {{decides to}} take Jack {{to a doctor}} so that <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> can be created. During the meeting, Rudy Stagg, a man {{infected}} with POS who had been killing dogs in order to contain the outbreak, stumbles into their room. Rudy ignores pleas to spare Jack and shoots at her, but Logan dives {{in front of the}} dog and is shot instead. Logan suffers a collapsed lung and falls into a coma. He awakens weeks later and learns that Jack is on life support. He says a final goodbye to Jack before her life support is turned off. Jack's immunity to POS leads to the creation of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> and cure, and Logan is finally able to reconcile with Robert, Craig, and Devon Wallacea childhood enemy whose dog died due to POS. The novel's epilogue, written as a newspaper article, reveals Logan and his family hold a private ceremony to honor Jack.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{scientists}} from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan (Unit 731 of the imperial Japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox. Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not be very effective due to the wide-scale availability of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Markinson gives Gabe {{a report}} on the virus called Syphon Filter, a {{bioweapon}} that one can program on a genetic level to target specific groups of people. Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test subjects with <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter, and she says there is no universal cure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{is responsible}} for substantial morbidity and mortality and current available treatments have many limitations. The ability of VL infection to generate life-long immunity offers promise {{for the development of}} <b>a</b> VL <b>vaccine.</b> <b>A</b> VL <b>vaccine</b> candidate has recently completed phase I clinical trials. We constructed a computer simulation model to determine the potential economic value of <b>a</b> VL <b>vaccine</b> in the endemic region of Bihar state, India. Results found <b>a</b> potential <b>vaccine</b> to be cost-effective (and in many cases economically dominant, i. e., saving costs and providing health benefits) throughout a wide range of vaccination costs, vaccine efficacies, and VL risks. Overall, our study strongly supports the continued development of <b>a</b> VL <b>vaccine...</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>vaccine</b> rather than <b>a</b> preventive <b>vaccine</b> that prevents infectious disease, sipuleucel-T is instead an immunostimulant.|$|R
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the ship is visiting the planet Ligon II to retrieve <b>a</b> <b>vaccine,</b> crewman Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) is abducted by the leader of the Ligonians. The race abide by a strict code of honor, and their leader seeks to use Yar as a pawn to increase his own personal power.|$|E
5|$|The {{vaccine is}} {{produced}} by Sanofi and goes by the brand name Dengvaxia. It {{is based on a}} weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four dengue serotypes. Two studies of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than wished for by some.|$|E
5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

50|$|Control of an {{outbreak}} in an endemic region involves quarantine, vector control and vaccination. To prevent this disease, the affected horses are usually slaughtered, and the uninfected horses are vaccinated against the virus. Three vaccines currently exist, which include <b>a</b> polyvalent <b>vaccine,</b> <b>a</b> monovalent <b>vaccine,</b> and <b>a</b> monovalent inactivated <b>vaccine.</b> This disease {{can also be}} prevented by destroying the insect vector habitats using insecticides.|$|R
30|$|Results: Preliminary data {{confirms}} the feasibility and translational potential of our innovative <b>Ad</b> vector <b>vaccine</b> platform. We demonstrate here that (1) we can successfully engineer <b>Ad</b> vector <b>vaccines</b> targeting DC by replacing the fiber knob domain with chimeric fiber-fibritin-sdAb molecules; (2) <b>Ad</b> vector <b>vaccines</b> incorporating DC-specific chimeric fiber-fibritin-sdAb are devoid of native adenovirus tropism, and transduce DC with much greater efficiency; (3) DC-targeted <b>Ad</b> vector <b>vaccines</b> can induce robust immune responses in vivo; (4) we can genetically modify GAd in a maner comparative to huAd 5.|$|R
5|$|UCSF {{professor}} Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) violates {{orders from}} Cheever (relayed through Hextall) to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough {{to work on}} <b>a</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Other scientists determine the virus is spread by fomites, with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates, with projections of one in twelve of the population being infected, and a 25-30% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>{{vaccines}}</b> {{became more}} common, many people began taking them for granted. However, vaccines remain elusive for many important diseases, including herpes simplex, malaria, gonorrhea and HIV.|$|R
50|$|During the year, the {{regulatory}} affairs department successfully obtained market authorisations for four new vaccines: <b>a</b> Fowl Typhoid <b>vaccine,</b> Live (Salmonella gallinarum 9R strain), an Inclusion Body Hepatitis vaccine, Inactivated I.P. (Adenovirus Type-IV strain), <b>an</b> Avian Bronchitis <b>vaccine,</b> Inactivated I.P. (Massachusetts Type H52 strain) and another Avian Bronchitis vaccine, Live I.P. (Massachusetts Type H-120 strain). In the near future, the Company {{expects to have}} three newly developed poultry <b>vaccines,</b> <b>a</b> large animal <b>vaccine</b> and <b>an</b> imported <b>vaccine</b> registered in 2016-17.|$|R
50|$|The task of {{developing}} <b>a</b> preventive <b>vaccine</b> for malaria {{is a complex}} process. There {{are a number of}} considerations to be made concerning what strategy <b>a</b> potential <b>vaccine</b> should adopt.|$|R
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) is Frank and Catherine's daughter. Although {{her father}} {{attempts}} to shield {{her from the}} disturbing nature of his work, it becomes apparent that she is beginning to share his precognitive abilities. Jordan survives the Millennium Group's viral apocalypse when her mother inoculates her with <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> obtained from rejected group member Lara Means, sacrificing her own life. After her mother's death and her father's obsessive quest to destroy the group, Jordan is cared for by her maternal grandparents and reunites with her father {{at the turn of}} the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|Later, fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells Black {{that he has}} {{uncovered}} computer files from the Group, indicating that a virus discovered by bio-weapons scientists in the Soviet Union has been living dormant in bird species {{since the end of}} the Cold War, and may now be making a resurgence in the United States. Watts reveals that <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> has been developed by the Group, but only in sufficient quantities for its members; Watts and Black have already been inoculated without having realized at the time. Black tells Watts to locate Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), another Group member, as he hopes to keep them safe in the cabin until the crisis resolves.|$|E
50|$|The Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) is <b>an</b> {{attenuated}} <b>vaccine</b> of <b>a</b> poxvirus. It was licensed {{and used}} as <b>a</b> poxvirus <b>vaccine</b> in Bavaria and is a vector for vaccination against non-poxvirus diseases.|$|R
25|$|The {{concerns}} about side effects led Sato to introduce an even safer acellular vaccine for Japan in 1981 that was approved in the US in 1992 {{for use in}} the combination DTaP vaccine. The acellular <b>vaccine</b> has <b>a</b> rate of adverse events similar to that of <b>a</b> Td <b>vaccine</b> (<b>a</b> tetanus-diphtheria <b>vaccine</b> containing no pertussis vaccine).|$|R
5000|$|Some of its {{candidates}} {{have failed in}} clinical trials: VLA43, <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>vaccine</b> against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, [...] V710, <b>a</b> therapeutic <b>vaccine</b> against Staphylococcus aureus (in collaboration with Merck), and IC41, therapeutic vaccine against hepatitis C ...|$|R
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of <b>a</b> <b>vaccine</b> in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|Marita {{reports to}} the Syndicate, which {{expected}} colonization at a much later date. Krycek offers Dmitri to the Syndicate in exchange for all their research on <b>a</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Meanwhile, Scully talks to Mulder about his meeting with Cassandra. She realizes that she has {{much in common with}} Cassandra, including being abducted at Skyland Mountain and having an implant inserted in the base of her neck. Scully visits Cassandra, who immediately realizes that she's a fellow abductee. Scully tells her not to remove the implant. Cassandra assures Scully that she never will, as she looks forward to being abducted again.|$|E
5|$|Prevention mostly {{involves}} eliminating kissing {{bugs and}} avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. <b>A</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{has not been}} developed as of 2017. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E
50|$|Typhoid {{vaccines}} are vaccines {{that prevent}} typhoid fever. There {{are two types}} that are widely available: Ty21a (<b>a</b> live <b>vaccine</b> given by mouth) and Vi capsular polysaccharide <b>vaccine</b> (<b>an</b> injectable subunit <b>vaccine).</b> They are about 30 to 70% effective {{for the first two}} years depending on the specific vaccine in question.|$|R
25|$|However, the 2010 {{international}} VGG recommendation generally {{considers the}} rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>a</b> non-core <b>vaccine,</b> except {{in areas where}} the disease is endemic or where required by law.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> peptide <b>vaccine</b> is any peptide {{which serves}} to immunize an {{organism}} against <b>a</b> pathogen. Peptide <b>vaccine</b> are often synthetic and mimic naturally occurring proteins from pathogens.|$|R
