40|$|Revision {{control is}} a vital {{component}} of digital project management and has been widely deployed for text files. Binary files, on the other hand, have received relatively less attention. This can be in-convenient for graphics applications that use {{a significant amount of}} binary data, such as images, videos, meshes, and animations. Exist-ing strategies such as storing whole files for individual revisions or simple binary deltas could consume significant storage and obscure vital semantic information. We present a nonlinear revision con-trol system for images, designed with the common digital editing and sketching workflows in mind. We use DAG (directed acyclic graph) as the core structure, with DAG nodes representing editing operations and DAG edges the corresponding spatial, temporal and semantic relationships. We visualize our DAG in RevG (revision graph), which provides not only as a meaningful display of the re-vision history but also an intuitive interface for common revision control operations such as review, replay, diff, addition, branch-ing, merging, and conflict resolving. Beyond revision control, our system also facilitates artistic creation processes in common image editing and digital painting workflows.

An hour into the seminar they came to a point of disagreement and had difficulty articulating what differentiated their positions. One graduate student, Linda Harris, said they should go off and decide what the impasse was and return in 20 minutes. That started their collaboration. The pattern of working separately, disagreeing, then integrating ideas typifies their long working relationship and provides context for reading this essay. While the reader will find differences between the ways they have been developing CMM, that should be read as a phase in a pattern that has made CMM challenging for them and, hopefully, provocative for you.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of endoscopic third ventriculostomy in pediatric patients as an <b>alternative</b> to shunt <b>revision</b> in the management of hydrocephalus. MATERIAL and METHODS The clinical data of 10 patients treated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy for malfunctioning shunts due to mechanical or dynamical shunt complications were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Seven patients (70 %) experienced successful outcomes, resulting in shunt independence. There have been no delayed failures following endoscopic third ventriculostomy in those cases. Of the three failures, the symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure became manifest within a median of 6 days, resulting in a new shunt placement. CONCLUSION The results of the present series show that endoscopic third ventriculostomy may constitute a valuable <b>alternative</b> to shunt <b>revision</b> in pediatric patients affected by hydrocephalus presenting with shunt malfunction. Because endoscopic third ventriculostomy is an opportunity for a hydrocephalic child to become shunt-free, it should be considered in all suitable cases as the first-choice treatment...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the modified endoscopic Lothrop (MEL) procedure for the management of failed osteoplastic flap (OPF) with obliteration of the frontal sinuses. SETTING: Adelaide University Academic Hospital Complex. STUDY TYPE: Prospective case study of 16 patients presenting with symptoms after OPF with obliteration of the frontal sinuses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients presented with symptoms of frontal sinus pain after having previously undergone OPF and fat obliteration of the frontal sinuses. All patients underwent computed tomography scanning; 13 underwent magnetic resonance imaging scanning, and 6 underwent a bone scan with technetium to exclude frontal osteitis. All patients underwent exploration of the frontal sinuses by way of the MEL procedure. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were found to have a frontal sinus mucocele, whereas one patient had no mucocele with only new bone and fibrous tissue found at the MEL procedure. Twelve of the 16 patients with mucoceles had resolution of their frontal headaches, with 15 having a patent and healthy communication between the mucocele and the nasal cavity. The one patient without a mucocele continues to have frontal pain. One patient underwent a successful MEL procedure but had persistent symptoms until a supraorbital ethmoid mucocele was removed at a revision procedure. Two other patients continued to have frontal headaches and pain despite a healthy ostium into the frontal sinus mucocele.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the operative risks, post-operative complications, and radiographic and functional outcomes in two cohorts of Vancouver B 2 femoral fractures around CCPT stems treated either by ORIF alone or revision surgery. METHODS: The results of 12 patients with B 2 periprosthetic fractures around a CCPT stems treated by ORIF alone (median follow-up 67 months) were compared with those of nine patients with a similar fracture treated by revision surgery (median follow-up 59 months). RESULTS: All fractures treated by ORIF alone healed and all stems restabilized and remained stable within their original cement mantle. These patients had significantly shorter overall operating room times (P = 0. 002), surgical times (P = 0. 002) and required fewer units of blood transfusion (P = 0. 008) than patients in the revision cohort. In the ORIF cohort, one patient had two dislocations. In the revision cohort, one patient had delayed wound healing, a second patient had delayed wound healing and two dislocations, and a third patient had two dislocations. CONCLUSION: Although further studies with larger numbers are required, treatment of these fractures with ORIF alone may be a viable <b>alternative</b> to <b>revision</b> surgery as it reduces the operative risks involved.

If the French revision process should have a successful outcome, Belgium {{will be one of the}} last countries to use a nineteenth century code. Does Belgium also need a revision of its Civil Code, or are there suitable <b>alternatives?</b> If a <b>revision</b> is advisable, a more fundamental question arises: How can a revised Belgian Civil Code cope with the stratification of private law and the multiple challenges every European legal system faces today? The first part of this essay briefly elucidates the challenges for the Belgian Civil Code. The second part looks for suitable responses, including (but not limited to) a possible revision of the aforementioned code. The third part will argue that a modernization of the Belgian Civil Code is essential to restore its central position in private law. Since two of the key advantages of codes are their durability and their comprehensive scope, a modern Belgian Civil Code’s content should be limited to concepts, basic principles, and general rules. Any attempt to offer an overview of private law in its entirety in a single civil code can only be detrimental to those two key advantages. Because of the limited powers of a national legislature, the further development of the law can only result from collaboration between many different actors. An unremitting emphasis on the facts underlying hard legal questions and on the legal discourse is a necessary element of such a collaborative contribution. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{endovascular}} correction (eC) {{has emerged}} {{in recent years as}} a possible <b>alternative</b> to surgical <b>revision</b> (Sr) in case of bleeding complications after peripheral bypass (PB). The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the effcacy and safety of EC compared to SR in case of bleeding complications of PB. MeTHodS: From January 2004 to December 2014, we have submitted 32 patients to surgery for acute bleeding in previous PB (25 venous bypass, in situ or reversed, 6 PTFe bypass and 1 composite bypass). The cause of the bleeding was the dehiscence of proximal anastomosis in 14 patients, the dehiscence of distal anastomosis in 11 patients and the rupture of the graft in 7 patients. all patients postoperatively underwent anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, antibiotic therapy and close ultrasound follow-up. Patency rate, limb salvage rate and survival rate in the short term were assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves. reSUlTS: of the 32 patients treated for acute bleeding in previous PB, 11 underwent endovascular correction with a technical success of 100 % (no need for reintervention), while in 21 patients a surgical revision was performed. among the latter, in 4 cases (19. 1 %) an early bleeding occurred, and endovascular correction was promptly performed solving the bleeding in the absence of sequelae (then a total of 15 patients were treated by endovascular correction). The 12 -month patency, limb salvage and survival rates were respectively 71. 4 %, 88. 2 % and 88. 2 % in the Sr group and 80 %, 93. 3 % and 100 % in the eC.

40|$|Institute for Communicating and Collaborative SystemsThis thesis {{combines}} theoretical, computational {{and experimental}} techniques {{in the study}} of reanalysis in human sentence comprehension. We begin by surveying the main claims of existing theories of reanalysis, and identify representation preservation as a key concept. We show that the models which most obviously feature representation preservation are those which have been formulated with in the monotonicity framework, which assumes that there are aspects of representation which are updated monotonically (i. e. non-destructively) from state to state, and that any reanalysis which requires a non-monotonic update is predicted to cause processing disruption. Next, we present a computational implementation, based on the monotonic theory of Gorrell (1995 b). We argue that in constructing such a model of reanalysis, it is essential to consider not only declarative constraints, but also the computational processes through which reanalysis routines explicit, leading to novel predictions in cases where there exist more than one <b>alternative</b> for structural <b>revision.</b> I show why preferences for such reanalysis ambiguities may differ between predominantly head initial languages such as English, and head final languages such as Japanese. After this, we consider the empirical consequences of the implemented model, in particular in relation to recent experimental data concerning modifier attachment. We shoe that the model is too restrictive, and we argue that the appropriate way to expand its coverage is to apply the monotonicity constraints not directly to phrase structure, but to thematics structure. We provide a general framework which allows such non-phrase structural models to be defined, maintaining the same notion of monotonicity that was employed in the previous model. We go on to provide solutions to some computational problems which accompany this change. Finally, we present two experimental studies. The first of these considers the issue of reanalysis ambiguity, and specifically the existence of a recency preference is confirmed in off-line tasks, such as comprehension accuracy and a questionnaire experiment, but is not confirmed in self-paced reading. We discuss some possible reasons for this dissociation between the on-line and off-line results. The second experimental study considers the effect of modifier attachment in Japanese relative clause ambiguities. In this study, we confirm the influence of thematic structure on the resolution of Japanese relative clause ambiguities, and we argue that this effect should be interpreted in terms of a constraint on reanalysis...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The outcome from {{conventional}} endodontic therapy {{does not always}} result in a healing of the periapical area, thus leaving a remaining lesion with or without symptoms. The primary treatment <b>alternative</b> is a <b>revision</b> of the orthograde root-filling if applicable. A second treatment alternative might be a periapical surgery procedure. The overall aim of this research project was to analyze the healing after a defined periapical surgical technique and commonly used retrograde root-filling materials in teeth with periapical periodontitis. Specific aims were to evaluate any difference in the healing outcome and tissue response from the used materials. The influence on healing from three variables; lesion size, lesion type and orthograde root-filling quality, were also analyzed. Materials and methods: Clinical studies: 422 teeth in 358 consecutive patients referred for a periapical surgery procedure to the Maxillofacial Unit, Halmstad Hospital, Halland, were included in three different consecutively implemented studies. All referred teeth were included except teeth with advanced periodontal disease with apical marginal communication and obvious root-fractures. The surgical technique and cleaning of the root-canals followed the same protocol in the 3 clinical studies, but the type of retrograde materials used differed. IRM was used in all studies as a control, due to its long-term use as a root-end seal, in the unit since before. The clinically compared materials were Super-EBA and thermoplasticized gutta-percha (Ultrafil®) with a sealer (AH-Plus®). All operated teeth were reviewed clinically and radiographically after minimum 12 months. Experimental model: The three tested materials from the clinical studies and a fourth material, mineral trioxide aggregate, MTA (Angelus®), were analyzed in an animal model. The periapical tissue response to the retrograde materials and bone healing after the osteotomy was evaluated. Radiographic examination, descriptive and morphometric histological analyses and SEM analysis were performed as evaluation techniques. Results: The results from the clinical studies revealed an overall successful healing outcome between 80 - 91 %. There was no statistical significance in the healing between the materials when comparing IRM to the two other clinically tested materials. The healing result in teeth treated with IRM had an increasing success throughout the different study series. The three evaluated pre- and perioperative variables had no significant influence on the treatment outcome after 12 months follow-up. The histological results revealed a better healing after the osteotomy in cases treated with IRM and MTA. New formed cement-like tissue was seen over all resected dentine surfaces in all healed cases regardless of the used retrograde material. The only material with signs of new cement-like tissue formation directly on the material surface was MTA. Conclusions: The success rates regarding healing after 12 months is high for all tested materials and show that these materials {{can serve as a}} root-end seal in periapical surgery with ultrasonic preparation. The outcome figures might be altered after a longer follow-up period. There is a difference in the perioperative handling of the tested materials, which could be an explanation to the slight variation of the healing figures. The radiographic status of the orthograde root-filling, type and size of the periapical lesion do not have a significant influence on the treatment outcome after a one-year follow-up. Regardless material used by the surgical team, they must be confident in its handling and management. The MTA material seems to be more biocompatible compared to the other tested materials and should because of this be the first material of choice, but from the clinical results in this study, the other materials are suitable as retrograde root-fillings as well...|$|R
6000|$|Turn we {{now to the}} <b>alternative</b> hypothesis. During <b>revision</b> of the {{foregoing}} essay, in preparation for that edition of the volume containing it {{which was published in}} 1883, there occurred the thought that some light on the origin of the planetoids ought to be obtained by study of their distributions and movements. If, as Olbers supposed, they resulted from the bursting of a planet once revolving in the region they occupy, the implications are:--first, that the fragments must be most abundant in the space immediately about the original orbit, and less abundant far away from it; second, that the large fragments must be relatively few, while of smaller fragments the numbers will increase as the sizes decrease; third, that as some among the smaller fragments will be propelled further than any of the larger, the widest deviations in mean distance from the mean distance of the original planet, will be presented by the smallest members of the assemblage; and fourth, that the orbits differing most from the rest in eccentricity and in inclination, will be among those of these smallest members. In the fourth edition of Chambers's Handbook of Descriptive and Practical Astronomy (the first volume of which has just been issued) there is a list of the elements (extracted and adapted from the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1890) of all the small planets (281 in number) which had been discovered up to the end of 1888. The apparent brightness, as expressed in equivalent star-magnitudes, is the only index we have to the probable comparative sizes of by far the largest number of the planetoids: the exceptions being among those first discovered. Thus much premised, let us take the above points in order. (1) There is a region lying between 2·50 and 2·80 (in terms of the Earth's mean distance from the Sun) where the planetoids are found in maximum abundance. The mean between these extremes, 2·65, is nearly the same as the average of the distances of the four largest and earliest-known of these bodies, which amounts to 2·64. May we not say that the thick clustering about this distance (which is, however, rather less than that assigned for the original planet by Bode's empirical law), in contrast with the wide scattering of the comparatively few whose distances are little more than 2 or exceed 3, is a fact in accordance with the hypothesis in question?[24] (2) Any table which gives the apparent magnitudes of the planetoids, shows at once how much the number of the smaller members of the assemblage exceeds that of those which are comparatively large; and every succeeding year has emphasized this contrast more strongly. Only one of them (Vesta) exceeds in brightness the seventh star-magnitude, while one other (Ceres) is between the seventh and eighth, and a third (Pallas) is above the eighth; but between the eighth and ninth there are six; between the ninth and tenth, twenty; between the tenth and eleventh, fifty-five; below the eleventh a much larger number is known, and the number existing is probably far greater,--a conclusion we cannot doubt when the difficulty of finding the very faint members of the family, visible only in the largest telescopes, is considered. (3) Kindred evidence is furnished if we broadly contrast their mean distances. Out of the 13 largest planetoids whose apparent brightnesses exceed that of a star of the 9·5 magnitude, there is not one having a mean distance that exceeds 3. Of those having magnitudes at least 9·5 and smaller than 10, there are 15; and of these one only has a mean distance greater than 3. Of those between 10 and 10·5 there are 17; and of these also there is one exceeding 3 in mean distance. In the next group there are 37, and of these 5 have this great mean distance. The next group, 48, contains 12 such; the next, 47, contains 13 such. Of those of the twelfth magnitude and fainter, 72 planetoids have been discovered, and of those of them of which the orbits have been computed, no fewer than 23 have a mean distance exceeding 3 in terms of the Earth's. It is evident from this how comparatively erratic are the fainter members of the extensive family with which we are dealing. (4) To illustrate the next point, it may be noted that among the planetoids whose sizes have been approximately measured, the orbits of the two largest, Vesta and Ceres, have eccentricities falling between [...] .05 and [...] .10, whilst the orbits of the two smallest, Menippe and Eva, have eccentricities falling between [...] .20 and [...] .25, and between [...] .30 and [...] .35. And then among those more recently discovered, having diameters so small that measurement of them has not been practicable, come the extremely erratic ones,--Hilda and Thule, which have mean distances of 3.97 and 4.25 respectively; Æthra, having an orbit so eccentric that it cuts the orbit of Mars; and Medusa, which has the smallest mean distance from the Sun of any. (5) If the average eccentricities of the orbits of the planetoids grouped according to their decreasing sizes are compared, no very definite results are disclosed, excepting this, that the eight Polyhymnia, Atalanta, Eurydice, Æthra, Eva, Andromache, Istria, and Eudora, which have the greatest eccentricities (falling between [...] .30 and [...] .38), are all among those of smallest star-magnitudes. Nor when we consider the inclinations of the orbits do we meet with obvious verifications; since the proportion of highly-inclined orbits among the smaller planetoids {{does not appear to be}} greater than among the others. But consideration shows that there are two ways in which these last comparisons are vitiated. One is that the inclinations are measured from the plane of the ecliptic, instead of being measured from the plane of the orbit of the hypothetical planet. The other, and more important one, is that the search for planetoids has naturally been carried on in that comparatively narrow zone within which most of their orbits fall; and that, consequently, those having the most highly-inclined orbits are the least likely to have been detected, especially if they are at the same time among the smallest. Moreover, considering the general relation between the inclination of planetoid orbits and their eccentricities, it is probable that among the orbits of these undetected planetoids are many of the most eccentric. But while recognizing the incompleteness of the evidence, it seems to me that it goes far to justify the hypothesis of Olbers, and is quite incongruous with that of Laplace. And as having the same meanings let me not omit the remarkable fact concerning the planetoids discovered by D'Arrest, that [...] "if their orbits are figured under the form of material rings, these rings will be found so entangled, that it would be possible, by means of one among them taken at hazard, to lift up all the rest,"--a fact incongruous with Laplace's hypothesis, which implies an approximate concentricity, but quite congruous with the hypothesis of an exploded planet.|$|R
