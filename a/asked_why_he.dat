The minister-general replied that the only way for Lagun Ein to escape the execution was for him to assassinate Minkhaung. Lagun Ein reluctantly accepted the offer.

25|$|The Tosefta to this {{treatise}} {{is divided}} into six chapters. Noteworthy is the story it narrates of the high priest Simon the Just, who never partook of the sacrifice offered by a Nazarite, {{with the exception of}} that offered by a handsome youth from the south, since in this case he could assume that the young man had made his vow with the best intentions and acceptably to God.

25|$|The {{presence}} of trade unionist James Mawdsley as a Conservative candidate caused {{some degree of}} protest.

25|$|Although {{the first}} {{official}} report of the police murders had been Gribble's telegram to Chief Protector of Aborigines Neville (via Buckland) on 30 July. In testimony, Inspector Mitchell admitted he had been informed of the murders on 21 July. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had not passed on these reports to police he stated it had been pushed from his mind by allegations of the Forrest River massacres. Likewise Sergeant Buckland testified that he had first heard of the massacres on 19 June. When asked who told him he replied that it was common knowledge around Wyndham but when pressed stated that Gribble had told him however, {{there is no evidence}} Gribble saw Buckland before 30 July, coincidentally, 19 June was the day Murnane returned and spoke to Buckland which resulted in Buckland ordering the patrol to return to Wyndham, an action that was never explained.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{asked his}} {{team on the}} radio whether he should make a pit stop to which they responded that he should remain on the track.

Hamilton was annoyed and <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> {{was not allowed to}} make a pit stop on the {{previous}} lap and dropped back from Rosberg so that he would not to wait behind his teammate. Vergne was released directly in front of Magnussen, causing him to swerve to prevent contact. This prompted the stewards to investigate Vergne. On lap 28, R√§ikk√∂nen had to make a second pit stop for a punctured tyre after Chilton's front wing glanced his left-rear wheel at Mirabeau corner. R√§ikk√∂nen thus fell {{to the back of the}} field. Ricciardo and Alonso consequently moved into third and fourth. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 30 and racing resumed with Rosberg leading Hamilton. As the race restarted, Magnussen passed Vergne going into Rasacasse corner but handed the position back because it had occurred before crossing the second safety car line. H√ºlkenberg took advantage and drove aggressively by going down the inside of Magnussen at Portier corner and passed him before entering the tunnel to claim seventh.|$|E
25|$|Duterte {{has said}} that he was sexually abused by a priest when he was a minor. After he was {{challenged}} by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and AdDU officials to name the priest and file a case against him, Duterte then revealed the priest's name as Fr. Mark Falvey, SJ (d. 1975). The Jesuits of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines confirmed that according to press reports in the United States, in May 2007, the Society of Jesus agreed to a tentative payout of USD16 million to settle claims that Falvey sexually abused at least nine children in Los Angeles from 1959 to 1975. Accusations against Falvey began in 2002 and he was never charged with a crime. Additionally in May 2008, the Diocese of Sacramento paid $100,000 settlement to a person allegedly raped and molested by Mark's brother, Fr. Arthur Falvey. However, it was not clearly indicated in the report if Mark Falvey was assigned at the Jesuit-run Ateneo de Davao. When <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> didn't complain when the abuse supposedly happened, Duterte claimed that he was too young to complain about the priest's abuse and was intimidated by authorities at that time. He also stated that he never disclosed that information after he was expelled and moved to a different high school and especially not to his family.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Vespers, Peter III {{constructed}} and outfitted a fleet for war. When the pope <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> needed {{such a great}} war fleet, Peter stated {{that it would be}} used against the followers of Islam along the northern coast of Africa, because he had legitimate trade interests there and needed to protect them. So when Peter received a request for help from the Sicilians he was conveniently on the north coast of Africa in Tunis, just 200 miles across the sea from the island. At first, Peter feigned indifference to the request of the Sicilians and their plight, but after several days to allow a proper showing of deference made for the pope's consumption, he took advantage of the revolt. Peter ordered his fleet to sail for Sicily, landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. While he marched towards Palermo, his fleet followed close by the coastal road. Peter III of Aragon's involvement changed the character of the uprising from a local revolt into a European War. Peter arrived at Palermo on September 2 and initially he was received by the populace with indifference, as merely one foreign king replacing another. However, after Pope Martin made plain his orders for the populace to accept Charles, Peter promised the islanders that they would enjoy the ancient privileges they had had under the Norman king, William II of Sicily. Thereafter, he was accepted as a satisfactory second choice and was crowned by acclamation of the people at the cathedral in Palermo on September 4, thus becoming also Peter I of Sicily.|$|E
