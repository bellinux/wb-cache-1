5|$|Rick, Shane and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) give gun {{training}} to Jimmy, Carl (Chandler Riggs) {{and the women}} on the farm. Shane (Jon Bernthal) takes Andrea (Laurie Holden) <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> give her advanced training after seeing how good she is with a weapon, but she is unable to hit a moving target. Shane tries to encourage her to remember her dead sister, Amy, but this only causes Andrea to storm away.|$|E
5|$|A {{version of}} the tale was {{composed}} by Potter in 1903, but set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> develop other projects. In 1904, she failed to complete a book of nursery rhymes for Warnes, and the 1903 tale was accepted in its stead. Potter elaborated its setting and storyline, and developed the tale more fully before publication. The illustrations depict the cottages and gardens of Sawrey, a village in the Lake District near Potter's Hill Top farm, and {{have been described as}} some of the most exquisite Potter ever produced. Ribby was modelled on a cat living in Sawrey, Duchess on two Pomeranians belonging to Potter's neighbour Mrs Rogerson, Tabitha Twitchit on Potter's cat at Hill Top, and Dr Maggoty on the magpies in the London Zoological Gardens.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} roll grew, the old {{buildings}} became too small. A major building programme {{began in the}} 1950s: £128,000 was set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> rehouse the school in purpose-built facilities adjacent to the existing school-houses. The first phase was opened in 1956 and included art and handicraft rooms; the second phase was completed in 1958 when physics and chemistry rooms were added; and the third came in 1965 {{with the opening of}} new biology and general science laboratories alongside other classrooms, while the following year saw a new hall/canteen and kitchen open. The final phase consisted of eight further rooms, built shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging work should begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|Graveyard Mountain Home is {{the third}} studio album {{released}} under the name Chroma Key by American keyboardist Kevin Moore. It was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music. Moore originally started work on the album in 2003, planning to release a less electronica-influenced album than previous Chroma Key albums, but put it <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> work on the first OSI album. He then moved to Istanbul, Turkey, where he wrote Ghost Book, the soundtrack to the film Okul. Enjoying the experience of writing music to film, Moore scrapped his previous plans for the third Chroma Key album, instead writing an album as an alternate soundtrack to an already-existing film.|$|E
5000|$|Grant {{also makes}} <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> clear up legends {{that had grown}} up around his leadership. After dismissing one tale, Grant wrote [...] "Like many other stories, {{it would be very}} good if it were only true." ...|$|R
5000|$|The role {{is usually}} both {{political}} and dramatic, with the malcontent voicing dissatisfaction with the usually 'Machiavellian' political atmosphere and often using <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> build up a kind of self-consciousness and awareness of the text itself that other characters in the play lack.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that the Legendary was adapted from multiple sources, though there are large sections of original material as well as material with no known source.

5|$|In {{the bronze}} medal match against England, Baggio {{returned}} to the starting line-up, playing behind Schillaci. He scored Italy's first goal of the match after stealing the ball from Peter Shilton. David Platt momentarily equalised, but with five minutes left on the clock, Baggio set up Schillaci, who was fouled inside the area by Paul Parker. Although Baggio was the regularly designated penalty taker for his national team, he stepped <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> allow Schillaci to score and capture the Golden Shoe, a gesture which was praised by the Italian media. Baggio assisted a goal by Nicola Berti in the dying minutes of the match, but it was incorrectly ruled offside. Italy won the match 2–1, capturing the third place medal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{plans for}} {{memorials}} included {{a garden of}} remembrance at the BDP firm's studio in Bristol, a published anthology of Yeates' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire. BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left behind an estate valued at £47,000, which included money set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> purchase a home with Reardon. As she had not written a will, the sum was inherited by her parents.|$|E
5|$|Roger Deakins {{signed on}} as cinematographer, having {{previously}} worked with Mendes on Jarhead and Revolutionary Road. Dennis Gassner returned as production designer, the costume designer was Jany Temime, Alexander Witt {{was director of the}} second unit, the stunt co-ordinator was Gary Powell and Chris Corbould supervised the special effects, while the visual effects supervisor was Steve Begg. All have worked on previous Bond films. Daniel Kleinman returned to design the film's title sequence after stepping <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> allow graphic design studio MK12 to create the Quantum of Solace sequence.|$|E
50|$|The play's title {{derives from}} the phrase {{shooting}} the messenger; it is told entirely {{from the perspective of}} the central character who frequently addresses the audience. His <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> camera do not serve a strict narrative function, but allow him to deliver his ruminations on black culture and society.|$|R
5000|$|Reviews were mixed, and Kaye, {{unhappy with}} the script, began to improvise on a nightly basis. His ad-libbed shtick and comic <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> the {{audience}} were crowd-pleasers, and word-of-mouth helped business. When he broke his foot, Kaye continued with the show, appearing at each performance either on crutches or in a wheelchair.|$|R

5|$|Smythe {{continued}} to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, {{when he made}} plans {{to fight in the}} Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought land for a farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E
5|$|The local {{way of life}} {{reflects}} the Scottish and Norse heritage of the isles, including the Up Helly Aa fire festival, and a strong musical tradition, especially the traditional fiddle style. The islands have produced a variety of writers of prose and poetry, often in the distinct Shetland dialect of Scots. There are numerous areas set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> protect the local fauna and flora, including {{a number of important}} sea bird nesting sites. The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds. Other local breeds include the Shetland sheep, cow, goose, and duck. The Shetland pig, or grice, has been extinct since about 1930.|$|E
5|$|Wagner began {{composing}} {{the music}} for Das Rheingold between November 1853 and September 1854, following it immediately with Die Walküre (written between June 1854 and March 1856). He began work on the third Ring opera, which he now called simply Siegfried, probably in September 1856, but by June 1857 he had completed only the first two acts. He decided to put the work <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on a new idea: Tristan und Isolde, based on the Arthurian love story Tristan and Iseult.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the film}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as emphasizing the free will side, as in each iteration, Lola improved the outcome by being more and more determined and assertive of her actions. Other characters' stories {{can be regarded as}} only <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> Lola's: they didn't take resolute and self-aware actions as Lola did so they got mostly random outcomes.|$|R

5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{was born}} in Orangeville, Ontario, the son of Judy Copeland, a single parent who worked two jobs to support her son. To this day, he has never met his father or seen a picture of him. He became {{interested}} in professional wrestling at a young age; his favorite wrestlers included Mr. Perfect, Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Ricky Steamboat, Shawn Michaels, and Bret Hart. As a teenager, Copeland attended WrestleMania VI sitting in the eleventh row at ringside. He was cheering on WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan against The Ultimate Warrior, and he credits this match with making him realize {{he wanted to be}} a wrestler. When he was 17, he won an essay contest with his local gym, and his prize was free wrestling training with Sweet Daddy Siki and Ron Hutchison in Toronto. He put his wrestling aspirations <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> help pay the bills. He held numerous jobs and then attended Humber College, where he graduated with a degree in radio broadcasting, then received training.|$|E
5|$|During 655, Æthelhere {{joined with}} Penda in {{an assault on}} Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere's motive for {{changing}} sides was to deflect Penda's attention from East Anglia {{and the destruction of}} his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces regii (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was probably at that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed)— in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu had a much smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda's ally Œthelwald of Deira stood <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> await the outcome.|$|E

As the race is about to begin, Kramer's car backfires; Jerry {{mistakes}} that for the starting pistol, giving him another head start. To the strains of the Superman theme, Jerry wins the race.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "Eddie Harris {{had nearly}} as many voices as sax timbres -- ranging from nasal, sly <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> {{electronically}} strangled yowls and even falsetto. But none of these Eddie Harrises, nor the spirited percussive help of Willie Bobo, could save the humdrum, mostly R&B-based material that he created for this album".Despite this, the album has avid fans.|$|R
50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{presentation}} is a historical review of atheism in the West with <b>asides</b> <b>to</b> the author's personal experience. Miller notes, as is implicit in the title, how only recently atheism was publicly acknowledged in the modern West, with none willing to state flat rejection of religious beliefs until Baron d'Holbach (1723-89). He examines why d'Holbach is not better known or celebrated.|$|R
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) starts {{dating a}} Brussels sprout farmer, Esther Bruegger (Nora Kirkpatrick), while {{negotiating}} {{the purchase of}} a tractor with her father Henry (Allan Havey). Dwight does poorly in the negotiations, yielding to all of Henry's terms. During the haggling, Esther's sisters flirt with Clark Green (Clark Duke) and try to coax him into buying farming equipment. Clark stops Dwight from signing the papers and takes him <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> tell him that he thinks Esther and her sisters are too physically attractive to be interested in men like them, and that Esther is probably just dating him so that her father can take advantage of him on the tractor deal. Dwight sees the logic in Clark's suspicion. However, Esther appears and tells Dwight that he should not sign the contract and negotiate for a better deal. Dwight realizes that Esther does care for him after all, much to Angela's dismay.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Khmer Rouge leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary {{publicly}} split, {{with the}} former denouncing the latter in a radio broadcast. Ieng Sary responded by disassociating himself from the Khmer Rouge {{and went on to}} form his own political party, the Democratic National Union Movement. Pol Pot's announcement prompted Ranariddh and Hun Sen to briefly set their political differences <b>aside</b> <b>to</b> jointly seek a royal pardon for Ieng Sary, who had been sentenced to death by the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) government in 1979. Subsequently, in October and December 1996, both Ranariddh and Hun Sen competed to win Ieng Sary's favour by separately visiting the leader at his fiefdom in Pailin. Hun Sen gained the upper hand, when he announced {{at the end of his}} visit that he had managed to convince Khmer Rouge soldiers under Ieng Sary's charge to join the CPP. When Ranariddh announced plans for a follow-up to visit Samlout, another town located within Ieng Sary's fiefdom, his soldiers threatened to shoot down Ranariddh's helicopter if he went there, prompting Ranariddh to cancel his visit.|$|E
