5|$|Both Virginia Tech and Clemson endured {{questions}} about their coaching staffs in the weeks <b>and</b> <b>months</b> prior to the Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer was interviewed by North Carolina prior {{to the end of}} the regular season, and he debated whether or not to accept that school's head football coaching job. On November 27, one week before Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl, Beamer announced that he would not be departing for North Carolina or any other school. Beamer also was considered for the vacant head-coaching position with the NFL's Washington Redskins, but he also declined that position. Other Virginia Tech football coaches were targeted by teams to fill vacant head-coaching positions. Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle was interviewed for a job at Toledo, but he declined the position. Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster was interviewed for the head-coaching job at Virginia, but he likewise declined the job.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{introduced}} a new Espanto Jr. {{as part of their}} Generacion 2012 group of wrestlers. In the weeks <b>and</b> <b>months</b> following the introduction of Generacion 2012, Hijo del Espanto (unclear if it was I or II) publicly stated that he and his brother were the rightful holders of the rights to the Espanto name, given to them by the only remaining, living member of the original Los Espantos, Espanto II. Hijo del Espanto demanded that Espanto Jr. changed his name, but neither the wrestler nor CMLL ever responded to the request.|$|E

40|$|Free radicals, {{superoxide}} dismutase activity and lipid peroxides in the gingiva of Dental University (ODU) plaque-susceptible (Sus) rats were estimated at {{the ages of}} 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 <b>and</b> 8 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> were {{compared with those of}} control Wistar-kyoto rats. Low levels of hydroxyl radicals were noted in the anterior and posterior gingiva of ODU Sus rats at 2 <b>and</b> 5 <b>month,</b> but significantly increased in the anterior gingiva at 4 <b>and</b> 7 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> in the anterior and posterior gingiva at 7 <b>and</b> 8 <b>months,</b> compared to those of control rats. Levels of carbon centered radicals were significantly higher in the anterior gingiva at 2 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> in both the anterior and posterior gingiva at 3 months. Superoxide dismutase activities were accelerated significantly at 2, 4 <b>and</b> 5 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> then were reduced at 8 months in the anterior gingiva. Otherwise, they were at low levels in the posterior gingiva at 1 <b>and</b> 2 <b>months,</b> were accelerated at 3 <b>and</b> 4 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> reduced again at 7 <b>and</b> 8 <b>months.</b> Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances decreased transitorily at 7 months in both the anterior and posterior. These experimental results suggest that free radicals {{may be related to the}} pathogenesis and development of gingivitis in plaque susceptible ODU Sus rats...|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} <b>and</b> <b>months</b> {{following}} Woods' admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated {{their relationships with}} him. Accenture, AT, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods. TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011. Golf Digest suspended Woods' monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue. In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online. A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods' affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} <b>and</b> <b>months</b> after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise {{the morning after the}} crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} {{politically}} charged and detailed weapons effects information was censored during this period. The Hiroshima-based magazine, Chugoku Bunka for example, in its first issue published March 10, 1946, devotes itself to detailing the damage from the bombing. Similarly, there was no censorship of the factually written witness accounts, the book Hiroshima written by Pulitzer Prize winner John Hersey, which was originally published in article form in the popular magazine The New Yorker, on August 31, 1946, {{is reported to have}} reached Tokyo in English by January 1947, and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. The book narrates the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to, <b>and</b> <b>months</b> after, the dropping of the Little Boy bomb. Beginning in 1974 a compilation of drawings and artwork made by the survivors of the bombings began to be compiled, with completion in 1977 and under both book and exhibition format, it was titled The Unforgettable Fire.|$|E

In the weeks <b>and</b> <b>months</b> following the flooding, various international groups provided aid totaling nearly $11million. The United States donated $622,732 worth of assistance, mainly {{to help with}} logistical work and relief efforts. The United States military also worked to purify drinking water in Honduras. Canada donated $412,201 worth of assistance, including providing shelter in Honduras and rebuilding schools. The country of Brazil donated about $1.68million worth of food. The Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department of the European Commission provided nearly $2.2million for relief efforts. Other European country donations included nearly $500,000 from Ireland for hygiene and food supplies, $675,675 from the Netherlands for general relief efforts, $154,570 from Spain through the World Food Programme, $159,559 from Germany for shelters, and $892,468 from Sweden. Several Asian countries donated to the relief efforts, including $123,810 from Japan to Honduras to purchase emergency goods, $22,000 from South Korea, and $10,000 from Singapore to Honduras. Non-governmental organizations and other groups providing aid included $1.5million from the Central Emergency Response Fund, $300,000 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $120,000 from Catholic Relief Services, and $289,000 from ACT Alliance.|$|E
5|$|As the Sole Survivor {{gradually}} expands their influence, tape {{recordings and}} journal entries reveal that despite its popularity, Nuka-World was under threat from serious mismanagement {{in the weeks}} <b>and</b> <b>months</b> prior to the Great War. Gradually, John-Caleb Bradberton, the creator of Nuka-Cola and the architect of Nuka-World, is revealed to have redirected resources to fund Project Cobalt, a weapons development project for the United States military. This culminated {{in the creation of}} Nuka-Cola Quantum, a variation of Nuka-Cola made with radioactive isotopes. In exchange for his support, the military agreed to include Bradberton in LEAP-X, an attempt to artificially prolong life; however, Braxton, the general in charge of Project Cobalt, saw Bradberton's prediction of an imminent war as a lack of confidence in the military, and thus betrayed him. When the Sole Survivor accesses Bradberton's office, they discover a hidden elevator leading to a private Vault. Inside is Bradberton's still-living head attached to a life support machine, a punishment by Braxton for doubting the military. The player is given the choice of shutting off the power and euthanizing Bradberton at his request, or keeping him alive for the sake of Sierra Petrovita, a recurring character from Fallout 3 who idolises Bradberton.|$|E
5|$|Since Johnston's death, {{his field}} of {{volcanic}} eruption prediction has advanced significantly, and volcanologists are {{now able to}} predict eruptions based on a number of precursors that become apparent between days <b>and</b> <b>months</b> in advance. Geologists can now identify characteristic patterns in seismic waves that indicate particular magmatic activity. In particular, volcanologists have used deep, long-period earthquakes that indicate that magma is rising through the crust. They can also use carbon dioxide emission as a proxy for magma supply rate. Measurements of surface deformation due to magmatic intrusions, like those that were conducted by Johnston and the other USGS scientists at the ColdwaterI and II outposts, have advanced in scale and precision. Ground deformation monitoring networks around volcanoes now consist of InSAR (interferometry), surveys of networks of GPS monuments, microgravity surveys in which scientists measure the change in gravitational potential or acceleration because of the intruding magma and resulting deformation, strain meters, and tiltmeters. Though there is still work to be done, this combination of approaches has greatly improved scientists' abilities to forecast volcanic eruptions.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} storage conditions on total protein (TP) and globulin fractions in fresh frozen bovine plasma units prepared and stored for transfusion, TP and globulin fractions were evaluated in fresh plasma <b>and</b> at 1 <b>month</b> <b>and</b> 6 <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> after blood collection in plasma stored at âˆ’ 20 Â°C. Significant differences in concentrations {{were found in the}} median concentration of total protein (P= 0. 0336), between 0 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>month</b> (P= 0. 0108), 0 <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0023), and 0 <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0027), in mean concentration (g/dL) of albumin (P= 0. 0394), between 0 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>month</b> (P= 0. 0131), 0 <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0035), and 0 <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0038), and beta- 2 fraction (P= 0. 0401), between 0 <b>and</b> 6 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0401) and 0 <b>and</b> 12 <b>months</b> (P= 0. 0230). This study suggests that total gamma globulin concentration in bovine frozen plasma is stable for 12 months at âˆ’ 20 Â°C. Total protein, ALB, and beta- 2 fraction have significantly different concentrations (g/dL) when compared to prestorage. This study has shown IgG protein fraction stability in bovine fresh frozen plasma collected for transfusion; therefore, bovine fresh frozen plasma seems to be suitable for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia (failure of passive transfer) in calves when stored for 12 months at âˆ’ 20 Â°C...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} aging on GABAB binding was {{investigated}} in rat brain. Receptor autoradiography was used to investigate both GABAB and GABAA binding at 2 months, 3 <b>months,</b> 13 <b>months,</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>months.</b> GABAB binding decreases significantly between 2 <b>months</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>months</b> of age, as does GABAA binding, with {{was investigated in}} rat brain.

The noncompetitive GABAB antagonist zinc, the competitive GABAB antagonist CGP 35348, and the guanyl nucleotide analogue GTP-[gamma]-S all inhibit GABAB binding identically in 2 <b>month</b> <b>and</b> 23 <b>month</b> brain.

5|$|The {{events of}} the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first {{instances}} of homosexuals fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' Black Cat Tavern in 1967. However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the raid was a factor: it was {{across the street from}} The Village Voice offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police. Many of the participants and residents of Greenwich Village were involved in political organizations that were effectively able to mobilize a large and cohesive gay community in the weeks <b>and</b> <b>months</b> after the rebellion. The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual Gay Pride events around the world.|$|E
5|$|There {{were small}} {{enclaves}} of Mi'kmaq {{in and around}} the coves of Bedford Basin on the Dartmouth shore. Directly opposite to Pier 9 on the Halifax side sat a community in Tufts Cove, also known as Turtle Grove. The settlement, dating back to the 18th century, had been a subject of controversy because white settler landowners wanted to remove the Mi'kmaq residents. In the years <b>and</b> <b>months</b> preceding the explosion, the Department of Indian Affairs had been actively trying to force the Mi'kmaq to give up their land, though this had not occurred {{by the time of the}} explosion. The fire aboard Mont-Blanc drew the attention of many onlookers on both sides of the harbour. The physical structures of the settlement were obliterated by the explosion and tsunami. While a precise Mi'kmaq death toll is unknown, records show that nine bodies were recovered, and the settlement was not rebuilt in the wake of the disaster. The Halifax Remembrance Book lists 16 members of the Tufts Cove Community as deceased, although not all the dead listed as in Tufts Cove were Indigenous. Survivors were housed in a racially segregated building under generally poor conditions and eventually dispersed around Nova Scotia.|$|E
