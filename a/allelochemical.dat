In my thesis, I investigated strain specific {{variability in the}} expression of <b>allelochemicals</b> of the harmful flagellate Prymnesium parvum, that is euryhaline but mainly bloom forming in brackish water. I found a large variation among strains, but further showed that all strains of P. parvum were more allelopathic in brackish water compared to marine water. In a marine microbial community, <b>allelochemicals</b> can affect prey, competitors and grazers both, directly and indirectly. For instance, in a food web where grazing controls prey abundance, the negative direct effect of <b>allelochemicals</b> on grazers will positive affect their prey. During my thesis, I investigated how marine microbial communities respond to the addition of <b>allelochemicals.</b> I performed field experiments with microbial communities from seawater collected from different places over Europe, and tested how this communities respond to the addition of <b>allelochemicals</b> from the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense. Before I incubated the microbial communities for several days with A. tamarense algal filtrate, I evaluated the allelopathic efficiency of the algal filtrates with an algal monoculture of Rhodomonas spp. This allowed me to compare the effect of A. tamarense filtrate between the different microbial communities. In general, bacteria reached higher abundances when <b>allelochemicals</b> were present. As <b>allelochemicals</b> also inhibited nanoflagellates and ciliates, we concluded, that <b>allelochemicals</b> indirectly benefit bacteria by reducing grazing pressure. In microbial food webs with many heterotrophic grazers, <b>allelochemicals</b> further benefitted other phytoplankton by inhibiting grazers. It was also shown that bioavailable DOM is released from a microbial community when <b>allelochemicals</b> are present. As most DOM {{was released from the}} seawater fraction > 60 μm, we concluded, that larger microorganisms are more affected by <b>allelochemicals</b> than smaller microorganisms. The results {{can be explained by the}} surface to volume ratio of microorganisms: Larger organisms provide more contact surface for <b>allelochemicals,</b> and therefore, are probably more vulnerable towards <b>allelochemicals.</b> In conclusion, the effect of <b>allelochemicals</b> on a microbial community depends among others on the structure of the microbial food web, the amount of available DOM, the particle density in the seawater and the composition of the phytoplankton community...|$|R

In this study, a liquid chromatography (LC) based metabolomics approach was applied to find biomarkers with allelopathic effects from W. trilobata. Ethanol and water were used to extract metabolites from the leaves of W. trilobata and analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole high-resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS).

5000|$|Another {{practical}} application of Crotalaria juncea includes fuel. Crotalaria juncea holds {{a relatively high}} fuel value. In fact, a process optimization method for the extraction of oil from Crotalaria juncea is being researched in order to utilize the fuel value in Crotalaria juncea. [...] The current method of oil extraction {{is known as the}} soxhlet based extraction which has an oil yield of 13% in four hours at 37 degrees Celsius. However, a novel three-phase partitioning based extraction shows an oil yield of 37% in two hours at 37 degrees Celsius. [...] Furthermore, the optimization factors that were identified include ammonium sulphate and butanol, pH, and temperature, and these factors impact the oil yield. Furthermore, Crotalaria juncea has applications in the agricultural field since it impacts common food production. Crotalaria juncea is identified as a plant that is an important summer cover crop in southeastern United States. The allelopathic effects of Crotalaria juncea on weeds, vegetable crops, and cover crops were observed via greenhouse and growth chamber experiments. Crotalaria juncea, reduced both the germination and seedlings of various crop species (bell pepper, tomato, onion, and others). The <b>allelochemical</b> activity in Crotalaria juncea was in the leaves and remained active for 16 days after harvest. [...] Furthermore, Crotalaria juncea’s <b>allelochemical</b> effect may have {{practical application}}s for weed management. Similarly, Crotalaria juncea can be used to improve nutrient patterns in agricultural plants. For instance, soil fertility in Paraiba, Brazil is generally low. To rectify this, animal manure is often used to supply agricultural crops with nutrients. However, researchers in Brazil hypothesized that planting and incorporating Crotalaria juncea with animal manure could enhance the nutrient mineralization pattern for agricultural crops. [...] Field and greenhouse experiments were used to test this hypothesis. After measuring the amounts of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium in the soils, it was discovered that Crotalaria juncea along with only half the usual dose of goat manure produced the best results. [...] This is because soils that consisted of this composition avoided immobilization of nitrogen while increasing the levels of phosphorus and potassium within the soil. [...] In other words, Crotalaria juncea was able to improve the overall nutrient mineralization pattern for agricultural crops.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order for}} an {{organism}} to [...] "escape", and then radiate into varying species {{it needs a}} mechanism to escape. These defense mechanisms vary widely and differ for different types of organisms. Plants use chemical defenses {{in the form of}} secondary metabolites or allelochemicals.

[...] An example of a plant <b>allelochemical</b> are alkaloids that can inhibit protein synthesis in herbivores. Other forms of plant defense include mechanical defenses such as thigmonasty movements which have the plant leaves close in response to tactile stimulation. Indirect mechanisms plant include shedding of plant leaves so less leaves are available which deters herbivores, growth in locations in that are difficult to reach, and even mimicry. For organisms other than plants, examples of defense mechanisms allowing for escape include camouflage, aposematism, heightened senses and physical capabilities, and even defensive behaviors such as feigning death. An example of an organism using one of these defense mechanims is the granular poison frog which defends itself through aposematism. It is important to understand that in order for escape and radiate coevolution to occur, it is necessary that the developed defense is novel rather than previously established.|$|E

Thus, ferulic acid (FA), caffeic acid (CA), benzoic acid (BA), salicylic acid (SA), gallic acid (GA) and phthalic acid (PA), exogenously applied to the fungal growth medium, were tested both alone and in combination with a soil HA (SHA) and a compost HA (CHA). The two HAs were also tested alone on the fungus. When the allelochemicals were applied alone, only FA, BA and SA evidenced a significant inhibition of mycelial growth, whereas FA, BA and CA increased the number of sclerotia formed. The two HAs alone reduced the early growth of the fungus and markedly stimulated sclerotia formation. A significant attenuation or, in some cases, suppression of the <b>allelochemical</b> effect on mycelial growth was caused by the coexistence in the medium of the <b>allelochemical</b> and each HA, especially CHA. Moreover, in general, the combinations of HA-allelochemical significantly stimulated sclerotia formation, with respect to the sole <b>allelochemical,</b> but decreased it with respect to HA alone.
