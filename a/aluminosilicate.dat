40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{transformation}} pathways of both included and excluded minerals during coal devolatilization and char combustion. Three Chinese coals of various ranks, namely YQ anthracite, DT bituminous coal and CF lignite, were size narrowed to 45 − 100 μm, devolatilized in nitrogen and combusted in air at 1300 °C, using a laboratory-scale drop tube furnace, to prepare chars and ashes. The mineral {{properties of the}} coals {{as well as their}} derived chars and ashes were analyzed using a computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy (CCSEM). The results demonstrate that, during coal devolatilization, whereas quartz and kaolinite are generally stable for all the three coals, included and excluded Fe-rich minerals (i. e., pyrite and siderite) as well as excluded Ca-rich minerals (i. e., calcite and ankerite) are decomposed and some of the intermediate products are incorporated with <b>aluminosilicates.</b> During char combustion, quartz participates in combustion reactions and forms <b>aluminosilicates.</b> Whereas the mullite-like phase in the YQ and DT chars changes little, that in the CF char absorbs Fe/Ca-rich fine particles and is incorporated into Fe–Ca-aluminosilicate. Most of the Ca/Fe-rich intermediate products react with <b>aluminosilicates</b> to form Fe-, Ca-, and Fe–Ca-aluminosilicates. The interactions between Fe/Ca-rich minerals and <b>aluminosilicates</b> are also observed. Calcium in Ca-rich minerals and iron in Fe-rich minerals of the YQ anthracite and the CF lignite interact with <b>aluminosilicates</b> during both coal devolatilization and char combustion processes. However, for the DT bituminous coal, such interactions between Ca-rich minerals and <b>aluminosilicates</b> only take place during devolatilization. The interactions between excluded Fe/Ca-rich minerals and included <b>aluminosilicates</b> during coal devolatilization are also observed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accidents at {{nuclear fuel}} cycle plants {{may lead to}} {{contamination}} of areas of land and water. Cheap and available sorbents including natural <b>aluminosilicates</b> {{can be used for}} rehabilitation and decontamination of large volumes of radioactively contaminated water, including drinking water, prevention of migration of radionuclides into ground and surface waters through the soil and returning contaminated soil to farming. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A comparative study of sorption properties of various natural and surface-modified <b>aluminosilicates</b> with respect to caesium is made. It is shown that sorption features of surface-modified <b>aluminosilicates</b> for Cs were improved by 100 - 1000 times compared with respective natural <b>aluminosilicates.</b> It is shown that surface modification of glauconite by a mixed nickel-potassium ferrocyanide phase allows it to considerably increase its specificity (caesium distribution coefficients (2. 9 ± 0. 8) Ч 103 mL g- 1 for natural and (4. 5 ± 0. 5) Ч 105 mL g- 1 for modified glauconite) as well as making it selective to caesium in the presence of other alkaline ions and also provides irreversible caesium sorption. CONCLUSIONS: Due to improved features, modified <b>aluminosilicates</b> can be more successful than natural ones when used for rehabilitation of radioactive contaminated territories (including agriculture) and water areas, as well as for decontamination of liquid radioactive wastes and for creation of geochemical barriers in solid radioactive waste storage. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.|$|E

The method distinguishes various types and strengths of strong Brønsted acid sites in <b>aluminosilicates</b> (zeolites, clays, ASAs) {{and can be used}} to quantify them. The concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites in ASAs is 2 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than that in zeolites. The acid catalytic activity in n-alkane hydroconversion correlates well with the number of strong Brønsted acid sites, as probed by our method, for steam stabilized zeolites, clays, and ASAs. The strong Brønsted acid sites in these <b>aluminosilicates</b> arises from hydroxyl groups located between aluminum and silicon occupied oxygen tetrahedra. Differences in Brønsted acidity are caused by differences in the concentrations of strong Brønsted acid sites...|$|R

2500|$|Zeolites are the <b>aluminosilicate</b> {{members of}} the family of {{microporous}} solids known as [...] "molecular sieves" [...] mainly consisting of Si, Al, O, and metals including Ti, Sn, Zn, and so on. The term molecular sieve refers to a particular property of these materials, i.e., the ability to selectively sort molecules based primarily on a size exclusion process. This is due to a very regular pore structure of molecular dimensions. The maximum size of the molecular or ionic species that can enter the pores of a zeolite is controlled by the dimensions of the channels. These are conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture, where, for example, the term [...] "8-ring" [...] refers to a closed loop that is built from eight tetrahedrally coordinated silicon (or aluminium) atoms and 8 oxygen atoms. These rings are not always perfectly symmetrical due to a variety of effects, including strain induced by the bonding between units that are needed to produce the overall structure, or coordination of some of the oxygen atoms of the rings to cations within the structure. Therefore, the pores in many zeolites are not cylindrical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{collector}} for separating diasporic bauxite {{serves as}} a type of flotation reagent by adsorbing selectively on diaspore to make it hydrophobic enough to separate it from the <b>aluminosilicates.</b> Although the flotation process is considered economical in the desilication of Chinese diasporic bauxite, the existing collectors fail to separate these ores because of their poor adsorption selectivity over other minerals. The present study was an attempt to seek a collector for selective flotation of diaspore over <b>aluminosilicates.</b> A novel carboxyl hydroxamic acid compound, 2, 2 -bis(hydroxycarbamoyl) decanoic acid (BHDA), was designed and synthesized, and the flotation behavior of diaspore, kaolinite, and illite was investigated by flotation tests with BHDA. The interactions between the BHDA and the minerals were also explored by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), zeta-potential measurement, and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Using BHDA as the collector, the pulp pH value affected the floatability of diaspore significantly while the floatability of kaolinite or illite was unaffected or only slightly affected. The dosage of BHDA had little effect on the floatability of the three minerals. The greatest difference in floatability between diaspore and <b>aluminosilicates</b> occurred at mid-range pulp pH (7). Large shifts in characteristic absorption peaks and new absorption peaks were observed for BHDA-treated diaspore but were absent from BHDA-treated <b>aluminosilicates.</b> The change in the negative zeta potential of diaspor...|$|R
