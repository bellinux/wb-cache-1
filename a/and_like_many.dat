5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Endecott {{used some}} of his {{properties}} to propagate fruit trees; a pear tree he planted still lives in Danvers, Massachusetts. He also engaged {{in one of the}} earliest attempts to develop a mining industry in the colonies when copper ore was found on his land. His name is found on a rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, <b>and</b> (<b>like</b> <b>many</b> early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{cultivated}} the family's small {{plot of land}} <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> {{women of}} the area, commuted {{three times a year}} to the Po Valley to work in its rice fields. Despite the Ponticelli family's hard work, they were impoverished and the children often went to bed on an empty stomach. When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living. After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son, Pierre, {{the rest of the family}} moved to Paris, leaving Lazare in the care of neighbors.|$|E

5|$|James Garfield {{was born}} the {{youngest}} of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, now Moreland Hills, Ohio. Orange Township {{had been in the}} Western Reserve until 1800, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> who settled there, Garfield's ancestors were from New England, his ancestor, Edward Garfield immigrating from Hillmorton, Warwickshire, England, to Massachusetts in around 1630. James' father Abram had been born in Worcester, New York, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named for an older brother, dead in infancy.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics {{focus on}} how the bonding of two lovers can become so strong that they {{practically}} become one entity, through the act of sexual intercourse. Apart from the sexual connotations, there is an aspirational undercurrent to the lyrics, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> of their subsequent songs, desire is explicitly linked to ambition–"Free your mind of doubt and danger/Be for real don't be a stranger/We can achieve it/We can achieve it".|$|E
5|$|This {{painting}} is considered among Matejko's most famous works {{and is also}} one of his largest canvases. It portrays an event of significant political triumph for Poland, the Prussian Homage, in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia. Prussia latter gained independence and turned against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, becoming one of the nations that divided Poland among them. Matejko's painting was created during the partition period, when independent Poland had ceased to exist, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> of Matejko's other works, it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs.|$|E

5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, the French army {{ceased to}} use the Mérens for drawing {{artillery}} in the mountains, and this corresponded {{to the beginning of}} the decline of the breed. The population fell dramatically during the second half of the 20th century, due to the modernization and mechanization of transport and agriculture. In 1950 in Senegal, the Mérens was used in attempts to create a horse tougher than the native M'Bayar, but the breeding program was not enough to significantly increase the Mérens population. The use of the Mérens in agriculture continued into the 1970s, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> French draft breeds, it was also bred for slaughter to produce horse meat. The mountains of Ariege acted as a sanctuary, preventing the Mérens, as well as other breeds such as Gascon cattle and Tarasconnaise sheep, from disappearing completely. By the early 1970s, however, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages {{from a bank}} in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta had to leave his job when he again became seriously ill. He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but he disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including a beaded belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E

5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> men of his day, Stanton's {{father was}} a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens are {{intelligent}} birds, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other corvids have innovative {{methods of}} seeking out food. Foraging {{takes place in}} the early morning or late afternoon; birds rest in the hotter part of the day. Food is taken mainly from the ground, birds either finding objects while flying overhead, or by walking along and looking. However, they occasionally feed in trees—Australian ravens forage eucalypt foliage for Christmas beetles (Anoplognathus), and devote a substantial amount of time to look for nests and eggs to eat. They have also been known to take golf balls from fairways, possibly mistaking them for eggs. Ravens use their bill rather than their feet to explore or turn items on the ground (rocks or sticks) over, or hold or snatch food while flying. They have also been recorded using fence posts as anvils to bash snails against before eating them. Australian ravens most often eat food where they find it unless taking food back for nestlings. Occasionally they have been observed caching carrion or a killed animal in a hole nearby to store it. They can pack shredded meat in their mouth under their tongue. Australian ravens have adapted well to eating food scraps in urban areas, such as school playgrounds, rubbish tips, bins outside supermarkets or restaurants, abattoirs, piggeries and farmyards. In one isolated study, they were observed feeding on nectar from eucalypt flowers. Australian ravens sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks with any of the other four species of Australian corvids. Sometimes they are aggressive with little ravens if both are at a food source and drive them off, though not if the smaller species greatly outnumbers the larger.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>many</b> other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, {{has been demonstrated}} to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|E
