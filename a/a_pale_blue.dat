5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue,</b> waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E

25|$|Paris green (copper(II) acetate triarsenite or copper(II) acetoarsenite) is an {{inorganic}} compound. It is {{a highly}} toxic emerald-green crystalline powder {{that has been used}} as a rodenticide and insecticide, and also as a pigment, despite its toxicity. It is also used as a blue colorant for fireworks. The color of Paris green is said to range from <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> green when very finely ground, to a deeper green when coarsely ground.|$|E
25|$|Besides ultramarine, {{several other}} blues were {{widely used in}} the Middle Ages {{and later in the}} Renaissance. Azurite, a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a {{substitute}} for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter Albrecht Dürer.|$|E
25|$|Some corps or {{units have}} small {{variations}} in their uniforms– for instance, military policemen wear a white belt and police hat, Naval personnel have dress whites for parades, paratroopers are issued a four pocket tunic (shirt) {{meant to be}} worn untucked with a pistol belt cinched tight around the waist over the shirt. The IDF Air Corps has a dress uniform consisting of <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> shirt with dark blue trousers. Similarly, while most IDF soldiers are issued black leather boots, certain units issue reddish-brown leather boots for historical reasons— the paratroopers, combat medics, Nahal and Kfir Brigades, {{as well as some}} SF units (Sayeret Matkal, Oketz, Duvdevan, Maglan, and the Counter-Terror School). Women were also formerly issued sandals, but this practice has ceased.|$|E

25|$|The video {{features}} 6,000 {{frames of}} stop-animation, which scroll vertically to indicate past and future. It begins showing <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> petal among tree branches, and objects against a pale background such as dolls, books and rocks {{that form the}} shape of an eye. During the choral section of the song, the images are of lights moving against a black background, followed by images of two overlapping blue circles, {{in the style of the}} Kikuuiki album cover artwork. After the third musical change, the video depicts objects on a pale background again. A book is shown being turned upside down, and the direction of the video changes from moving downwards to upwards. The stop-motion actions are shown being reversed, such as a stained-blue shirt losing its stain. A woman played by fashion model Lillian is shown lying on the ground, wearing an indigo dress and feet dyed blue. The final scene slowly zooms out, showing the woman as well as all of the objects from the earlier scenes in one single frame.|$|E
500|$|The {{need for}} an {{official}} state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent and distinguish itself among the other U.S. states at the exposition. In lieu of an official state flag, the commission adopted and used a state flag of its own design at the West Virginia building at the exposition, which was a [...] "sprig of mountain laurel upon an immaculate white field with <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> border".|$|E
500|$|Driving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a {{young girl}} walking towards them, and signalled Hindley to stop, which she did not do until she had passed the girl. Brady drew up {{alongside}} on his motorbike, demanding to know why she had not offered the girl a lift, to which Hindley replied that she recognised her as Marie Ruck, a near neighbour of her mother. Shortly after 8:00pm, continuing down Froxmer Street, Brady spotted a girl wearing <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> coat and white high-heeled shoes walking away from them, and once again signalled for the van to stop. Hindley recognised the girl as Pauline Reade, a friend of her younger sister, Maureen. Reade got into the van with Hindley, who then asked if she would mind helping to search for an expensive glove she had lost on Saddleworth Moor. Reade said she was in no great hurry, and agreed. At 16, Pauline Reade was older than Marie Ruck, and Hindley believed {{that there would be}} less of an outcry over the disappearance of a teenager than there would over a child of seven or eight. When the van reached the moor, Hindley stopped and Brady arrived shortly afterwards on his motorcycle. She introduced him to Reade as her boyfriend, and said that he had also come to help find the missing glove. Hindley claimed Brady took Reade onto the moor while Hindley waited in the van. After about 30minutes Brady returned alone, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying. Her throat had been cut twice with a large knife. The larger of these wounds was a four-inch incision across her voice box, and the collar of Reade's coat had been deliberately pushed into this wound. He told her to stay with Reade while he fetched a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit to the moor, to bury the body. Hindley noticed that [...] "Pauline's coat was undone and her clothes were in disarray... She had guessed from the time he had taken that Brady had sexually assaulted her." [...] Brady's account differed from Hindley's. He claimed that Hindley was not only there at the scene, but that she assisted him with the sexual assault on Pauline. Returning home from the moor in the van—they had loaded the motorcycle into the back—Brady and Hindley passed Reade's mother, Joan, accompanied by her son, Paul, searching the streets for Pauline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{subject in}} this print {{corresponds}} to the typical depiction of female ghosts in Edo art: [...] "a fragile form with long, flowing hair... dressed in pale or white clothing, the body below the waist tapered into nothingness." [...] The central area {{is dominated by the}} figure of a female spirit with extremely long, wildly flowing black hair, crowned by <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> and white decoration. Unlike in many other yūrei-zu, the ghost in this print is not disfigured or particularly ghoulish. She wears a long, pale blue kimono with the long sleeves (furisode - 振袖) common to the kimono of single women and female ghosts. Underneath are two inner robes, one solid red, and the other with <b>a</b> <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> and white geometric design.
