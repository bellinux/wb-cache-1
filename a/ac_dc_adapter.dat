A lot of security systems types have been apply to make sure the safety of the premise. One of it is automatic identification system which really helpful human especially to identify the user ID (identification) of the premise. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a component that suitable for this project. This project was designed and built the system using RFID for access the doors of the premise by indentify the RFID tag user. It then output their description such as ID numbers and user names to an attaches LCD screen. The system is powered by 9 V batteries or using <b>AC</b> TO <b>DC</b> <b>adapter.</b> The main idea in this project is to create a system which that can provide security {{for the safety of the}} premise. At the heart of project is a PIC 16 F 876 A microcontroller will be used as a brain of the system that will control the system through a source code (C code) build using MPLab software. In this project, passive tag will be use as an identifier of the user. In the tag will be include RFID tag ID numbers of the user. Every RFID tag is unique because the ID of the tag is different for all the tag. So, it is really safe to use the RFID system for a premise security. Additionally, the PIC will process the data which receive from RFID tools and responsible for sending the output to the LCD screen which will be show the character...|$|R

High-voltage package was designed based on the IPC- 2221 standard specification and creepage distance was calculated under external component lead, uncoated. Two epoxy molding compounds were used namely as type A and B. Key properties of EMCs were identified such as ionic content, glass transition temperature and volume resistivity. The electrical tested at room temperature on high-voltage leakage current at 700 V showed EMC B has no failure compared with EMC A. On top of that, electrical parametric distribution showed that the Cpk of EMC B was extremely robust compared with EMC A. Reliability test was conducted for high temperature operating life test at 115 ˚C and EMC B was passed up to 1000 hours while EMC A was failed. Meanwhile, High Temperature Storage Life test at 150 ˚C and Temperature Humidity Bias Test at condition 85 ˚C, 85 % relative humidity showed that EMC B was passed for 1000 hours but EMC A was failed at 168 hours.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a hybrid AC/DC micro grid which will reduces {{the process of}} several reverse conversions in an individual <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. The renewable sources such as wind generators, photovoltaic panels and fuel cell are connected to a hybrid grid. AC sources and loads are linked with <b>AC</b> grid and <b>DC</b> sources and loads are linked with DC grid. The proposed hybrid grid operates in a grid-tied or autonomous mode. Both <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> networks are connected by a multi- bidirectional converter. This multi-bidirectional converter operates in parallel with <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> grid. Hence, demand over an individual grid can be coordinately controlled by multi-bidirectional converter. The co-ordination control algorithm at the bidirectional converter is proposed. Co-ordination control provides uninterrupted and smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link. A hybrid grid has modeled and simulated using the Simulink in the MATLAB. The simulation {{results show that the}} system can provides uninterrupted power, smooth power transfer between <b>AC</b> and <b>DC</b> link and also manage the demand...|$|R
