In pure cultures, the specific growth rates found were 0. 29 h⁻¹ for H. uvarum, 0. 23 h⁻¹ for H. guilliermondii and 0. 18 h⁻¹ for S. cerevisiae. No significant differences were observed between these values and those obtained in mixed cultures.

Growth of <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> reduced the total content of higher alcohols in wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, the highest levels of 2 -phenylethyl acetate were obtained when H. guilliermondii was inoculated in grape musts, whereas H. uvarum increased the isoamyl acetate content of wines. <b>Apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> produced high amounts of ethyl acetate; however, the level of this compound decreased in mixed cultures of <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> and S. cerevisiae.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of the flocculent Kloeckera apiculata {{strain in}} coculture with the nonflocculent Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, both yeasts isolated from wine, has been analyzed. Pure culture of Kloeckera apiculata (<b>apiculate</b> <b>yeast)</b> exhibits 75 % flocculation in the yeast extract/peptone/glucose (containing 20 g/L of glucose, YPG 20) medium after 24 -hour incubation at 28 °C. This yeast expresses a weak flocculent phenotype in glucose-poor medium (10 % of flocculated cells). Increasing the glucose concentrations in this medium induces yeast flocculation. When the <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeast</b> was co-inoculated with a nonflocculent strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (elliptic yeast), {{an increase of}} the number of elliptic cells that settled {{at the bottom of the}} culture was observed.

However, a lower percentage of Kloeckera apiculata flocculation with respect to the pure cultures was observed, this behaviour being correlated with a higher rate of glucose consumption by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|The use of Kluyveromyces phaffii DBVPG 6076 killer toxin against <b>apiculate</b> wine <b>yeasts</b> {{has been}} investigated. The killer toxin of K. phaffii DBVPG 6076 showed {{extensive}} anti-Hanseniaspora activity against strains isolated from grape samples. The proteinaceous killer toxin {{was found to}} be active in the pH range of 3 to 5 and at temperatures lower than 40 °C. These biochemical properties would allow the use of K. phaffii killer toxin in wine making. Fungicidal or fungistatic effects depend on the toxin concentration. Toxin concentrations present in the supernatant during optimal conditions of production (14. 3 arbitrary units) exerted a fungicidal effect on a sensitive strain of Hanseniaspora uvarum. At subcritical concentrations (fungistatic effect) the saturation kinetics observed with the increased ratio of killer toxin to H. uvarum cells suggest the presence of a toxin receptor. The inhibitory activity exerted by the killer toxin present in grape juice was comparable to that of sulfur dioxide. The findings presented suggest that the K. phaffii DBVPG 6076 killer toxin has potential as a biopreservative agent in wine making. Since Bevan and Makower (3) discovered the killer phenom-enon in strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, several other yeast species have been found to produce a toxic proteinaceous factor that kills sensitive strains (17, 20, 21, 30, 31).

Here, we report a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of four spontaneous Malaysian cocoa pulp fermentations across two time points in the harvest season and two fermentation methods. Our results show that the cocoa microbiota consists of a ‘‘core’’ and a ‘‘variable’’ part. The bacterial populations show a remarkable consistency, with only two dominant species, Lactobacillus fermentum and Acetobacter pasteurianus. The fungal diversity is much larger, with four dominant species occurring in all fermentations (‘‘core’’ yeasts), and a large number of yeasts that only occur in lower numbers and specific fermentations (‘‘variable’’ yeasts). Despite this diversity, a clear pattern emerges, with early dominance of <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> and late dominance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

40|$|Review article. Part of {{the special}} issue "Wine {{microbiology}} and safety: from the vineyard to the bottle (Microsafety Wine) ", 19 - 20 Nov. 2009, ItalyIn wine production, yeasts have both beneficial and detrimental activities. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the yeast mainly responsible for turning grape juice into wine but this species and several others may also show undesirable effects in wines. Among such effects, technologists are particularly concerned with the production of offflavours that may occur during all stages of winemaking. Typical spoiling activities include the production of ethyl acetate by <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> before fermentation, hydrogen sulphide by S. cerevisiae during fermentation phases, acetaldehyde by film-forming yeasts during bulk storage, and volatile phenols by Dekkera bruxellensis during storage or after bottling. The occurrence of these hazards depends on the technological operations designed to obtain a given type of wine and most can be avoided by current preventive or curative measures. On the contrary, good manufacturing practices must be strengthened {{to deal with the}} problem of volatile phenol production in red wines. Appropriate monitoring of D. bruxellensis populations and quantification of 4 -ethylphenol is advised during storage, particularly when oak barrels are used, and absence of viable cells must be guaranteed in bottled wines.

In this study, we investigated the impact of two EW treatments (40 and 400 mg/L free chlorine) on grape mycobiota using culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Moreover, the effect of yeast inoculation on treated and non-treated grapes was also considered. At the end of the fermentation, the wines produced were subjected to chemical and aroma analyses. The results revealed a decrease of about 0. 5 log CFU/mL of the total yeast population on grapes surface independently of the dose of EW applied. Yeast inoculation and EW treatments shortened the time needed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to dominate <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts,</b> particularly, 2 days for inoculated and 7 days for spontaneous fermentations. A decrease of acetic acid (about 55 %) was also observed compared to untreated spontaneous fermentation. In addition, aroma analysis highlighted a positive contribution of inoculated yeast on the wine aromas, since they had approximately 50 % higher pleasant esters compared to spontaneous fermented wines. Industrial Relevance: Sulfur dioxide is widely used in crushed grapes prior to fermentation due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. However, legislative rules, health risks and negative consumer perception related to its presence and use have resulted in a need to find new sanitizers able to reduce its use. The effectiveness of EW to reduce yeast species able to produce high levels of undesirable compounds was demonstrated.

40|$|Spontaneous {{grape must}} fermentations are {{consistently}} {{characterized by a}} sequential colonization of the substrate according to which <b>apiculate</b> <b>yeasts</b> (Hanseniaspora/Kloeckera), that predominate {{at the beginning of}} the process, are quickly replaced by Saccharomyces yeasts. In addition, other yeasts such as those belonging to the genera Candida, Torulaspora, Kluyveromyces, Zygosaccharomyces and Metschnikowia, may be present during must fermentation (Fleet, 2003). These “wild” yeasts have been considered for a long time responsible for wine defects. Thus, to inhibit their development and ensure the production of wines with repeatable characteristics, grape must is commonly treated with SO 2 and inoculated with selected cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, quantitative studies on the composition of the microflora of fermenting musts indicate that wild non- Saccharomyces yeasts may persist during inoculated fermentations (Mora et al., 1990) and produce high amounts of different metabolites and enzymes able to carry out the transformation of the aroma precursors present in grapes (Fernandez et al., 2000). Thus, non- Saccharomyces yeasts may influence the perceivable characteristics of the final product (Romano et al., 2003). In this context, the possibility “to mimic” natural fermentations, maintaining the control of the fermentative process, represents an interesting approach to the improvement of the final quality of wine. In this study 105 isolates of non- Saccharomyces yeasts, belonging to different genera, naturally involved in spontaneous fermentations and coming from grape-musts of different origins, were identified and evaluated for their principal oenological characters.
