25|$|Swanson {{sought to}} develop an <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> which would mimic {{the sound of a}} classic steam whistle. Using ancient Chinese musical theory, Swanson {{produced}} the six-note model 'H6'. This was impractical for railroad use, due to its relatively large size. Railroad equipment operates over routes restricted by loading gauge, a difference of only a few inches may prohibit that equipment from operating on the line in question.|$|E

25|$|Southern Pacific road {{switcher}} diesels often had elaborate lighting clusters front and rear, {{with a large}} red Mars Light for emergency signaling, and often two pairs of sealed-beam headlamps, {{one on top of}} the cab and the other below the Mars Light on the nose. Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|E
25|$|The Duke boys added {{a custom}} <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> to the General Lee that played the first twelve {{notes of the}} song Dixie. The Dixie horn was not {{originally}} planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer drove by and sounded his car's Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By {{the end of the}} show's sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find, and more expensive. In addition, the television series Knight Rider began to rival the General Lee's stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums' crew, or recycled stock jump footage — the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.|$|E
500|$|... "Ring the Alarm" [...] is an R {{song that}} {{incorporates}} elements of punk rock, According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, it is composed {{in the key}} of A minor but changes to E major in the bridge and changes to A minor, and set in common time at a moderately slow tempo of 85 beats per minute. The instrumentation of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] includes drums, clattering percussion instrument, treble synthesizers, and bass instrument. It also makes use of a slapping backbeat, an <b>air</b> <b>horn,</b> titanic handclaps, plonks, and breathing noises. A blaring siren is used as the song's introductory sound, setting an aggressive tone, which is augmented by Knowles' throaty mezzo-soprano growl. Tim Finney of Pitchfork described her vocals as [...] "thrillingly sharp with anxiety and paranoia", and Tom Breihan of The Village Voice commented that she sings with [...] "a frantic intensity". Knowles' vocals range from the note of A3 to F5. Her strong shout vocal styling is meshed with the grooves, and enhanced with echo and shimmer, which overlap with one another, creating a neo-warm vibe.|$|E

500|$|As such, the FCC representatives {{start to}} censor any foul {{language}} and inappropriate behavior in Quahog, ruining their times of privacy; for instance, a black [...] "censor's bar" [...] is pulled over Peter's genitals by FCC employees {{as he leaves}} the shower, all expletives are overdubbed with an <b>air</b> <b>horn,</b> and audible farts are banned in public (replaced with a dubbing of Steven Wright punchlines). Everyone in Quahog is angered by this, except for Lois, who approves of the FCC's actions, believing that everyone in Quahog needs a lesson in decency. However, she realizes that the FCC's presence puts her and Peter's sex life to a stop after they prevent her and Peter from having any real sex, even if no one's watching (specifically banning thrusting, tongue-kissing, moaning and any movement whatsoever). Peter angrily blames her, thus causing her to feel guilty for letting this happen. They lobby Congress to have the FCC's rulings reversed. At first they disagree due to their strong support of the FCC, but they relent when Peter honorably retorts by making them realize the resemblance of many Washington buildings to various private parts and any other body parts associating with it, such as the Capitol Building to a breast. The oppression of the FCC is finally gone, Lois congratulates Peter for beating the FCC on its tracks, and the family settles down to watch an uncensored episode of The Brady Bunch that features bathroom jokes.|$|E

When Bender refuses the Robot Devil then makes another deal, in which he trades Bender a stadium <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> for his [...] "crotch-plate" [...] so that he can annoy people. When Bender uses the <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> on Leela, he causes her to go deaf. Leela refuses to tell Fry that she is deaf because she is afraid that Fry will stop writing the opera, so she attends the premiere pretending she can still hear the performance.

2500|$|As Diesel {{locomotives}} {{began to}} replace steam on most railroads during the mid-20th century, it was {{realized that the}} new locomotives were unable to utilize the steam whistles then in use. [...] Early internal combustion locomotives were initially fitted with small truck horns or exhaust-powered whistles, but these {{were found to be}} unsuitable and hence the <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> design was scaled up and modified for railroad use. Early train horns often were tonally similar to the air horns still heard on road-going trucks today. It was found that this caused some confusion among people who were accustomed to steam locomotives and the sound of their whistles; when approaching a grade crossing, when some people heard an <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> they expected to see a truck, not a locomotive, and accidents happened. So, locomotive air horns were created that had a much higher, more musical note, tonally much more like a steam whistle. This is why most train horns have a unique sound, different from that of road going trucks, although many switch engines, which didn't see road service (service on the main lines), retained the deeper truck-like horns.|$|E

[...] on the air. Chi'en made a live apology, but was fired a few hours later. The incident brought the show nationwide press. Hughes and Cumia announced the campaign's end in December 2005, after a fan disrupted a live report by Anthony Johnson with an <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> and a show sign.

50|$|In trucks, the <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> {{is powered}} with {{compressed}} {{air from the}} vehicle's air brake system.

Thus, an outstretched hand reaching upward and pumping is a signal to the driver of an <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> equipped vehicle, requesting a toot. In modern trucks the horn is actuated by a button on the steering wheel (just like a normal car horn). Some trucks have both electric and <b>air</b> <b>horn,</b> selectable by a switch on the dashboard. This is to prevent the use of the powerful <b>air</b> <b>horn</b> in populated areas.|$|E
