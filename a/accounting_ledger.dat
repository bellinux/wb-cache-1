500|$|The {{threat from}} within {{apparently}} defeated, Reid {{and his government}} {{turned their attention to}} the threat from without: the convention's repudiation had convinced Aberhart that his Social Credit League must run candidates in the next election. Reid's defence took two forms. The first was an overt attack on Aberhart and his policies. He insisted that Aberhart's proposed [...] "monthly credit dividends" [...] of C$25 could not be issued unless taxes increased tenfold. He argued that Aberhart's proposed means of raising revenue—"unearned increments" [...] and [...] "production levies"—were actually disguised taxes, which would be paid primarily by farmers, and that his claims that the necessary credit could be created [...] "at the stroke of a fountain pen" [...] on an <b>accounting</b> <b>ledger</b> were absurd. He further pointed out that elements of Aberhart's plan, including the provincial government's entry into banking {{and the creation of a}} provincial tariff, were ultra vires the province under the Canadian constitution. These themes were expounded on by Priestly and Brownlee, both of whom undertook speaking tours and radio addresses, and by legal and economic experts commissioned by the government.|$|E

5000|$|The seminal {{paper by}} William Baumol and Bowen {{introduced}} the term cost disease for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency {{of this kind}} of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the Molière play [...] "Tartuffe" [...] in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an <b>accounting</b> <b>ledger.</b> In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an <b>accounting</b> <b>ledger.</b> In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in human capital (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.|$|E

5000|$|Allen's first firearm was the Pocket Rifle, a single-shot under-hammer {{percussion}} pistol. The name likely {{derives from}} the fact that most pistols of the day did not have rifled barrels, rather than any claim to extraordinary size. The hammer located {{on the bottom of the}} weapon allowed for target sights to be mounted on the top axis of the barrel. Made in [...]28 to [...]44 caliber, average barrel length was 12 inches. Typically sold in pairs, the pocket rifle was produced during 1837-1847. Though most of this period was during the Thurber partnership, markings show exclusively 'Ethan Allen', and evidence from an <b>accounting</b> <b>ledger</b> indicate that supply and distribution orders processed separately from other models of firearms. This likely indicates that Allen retained ownership of this model after establishing the partnership with Thurber. A second pocket rifle was produced under the Allen and Thurber name retaining the under-hammer design, but with much smoother lines. The pictures the author has seen show a barrel much shorter than 12 inches, and the caption reads [...]36 caliber.|$|E

However, the sensational case immediately attracted national attention, and The New York Times published an article about the trial on January 20, 1853, just days after its conclusion and only two weeks after Northup's rescue.|$|E
