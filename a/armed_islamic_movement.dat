Together with a fellow Afghan veteran, Abderrahmane Dahane, he {{launched}} {{an attack on the}} Guemmar barracks on November 27, 1991, {{before the start of the}} Algerian Civil War proper; this attack is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). He was arrested on January 28, 1992.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, Algeria was at {{the peak}} of a brutal civil {{conflict}} that had begun after the military's cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Bentalha, a town a few km south of Baraki (see map), a satellite town of Algiers, voted FIS in the elections, and many inhabitants were initially in favor of the Islamist guerrilla groups which began fighting the government after the elections' cancellation; some joined them. Initially, the guerrillas in the area belonged to the revived <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) and various independent groups; after 1994, these were integrated into the larger Armed Islamic Group (GIA). The army had a strong presence in the area, with a post on the eastern entrance of the town, a number of roadblocks, and a barracks {{on the north side of}} Baraki. The GIA too had a strong local presence; between 1994 and 1996, they walked the streets of Bentalha openly, and killed people associated with the government. The government established a [...] "Patriot" [...] communal guard of about ten people in Bentalha in June 1996.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1984, the {{government}} released some 92 of his supporters. Within a few months, he returned, reestablished his contacts, reconstituted the MAIA in February 1985, and began fighting again. In August, the group mounted two prominent operations - an armed robbery at {{a factory in}} Algiers on the 21st, and {{an attack on a}} police barracks in Soumaa on the 27th, killing a police cadet and taking weaponry. They painted the phrase [...] "Allah the Avenger is with us!" [...] across the gates of the barracks at Soumaa, to indicate that their motive was not simple criminality. Over the next two years, his group would continue its campaign, inflicting losses on government forces when pursued, but more generally targeting institutions it saw as un-Islamic, such as girls' schools, libraries, restaurants, and cinemas. On February 3, 1987, Bouyali finally fell in an ambush by the security services, and the movement was destroyed. Its surviving members were put on trial in July, with 5 of the 202 tried receiving the death penalty and 15 acquitted. The last of these were released on July 29, 1990. In 1991, several of these, led by Abdelkader Chebouti, reconstituted the organization as the <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> <b>Movement.</b> Shortly afterwards, some, such as Mansour Meliani, split with it to found the notably more violent Armed Islamic Group.|$|E
50|$|Mustafa Bouyali (Ar. مصطفى بويعلي) was {{the leader}} of the Algerian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement,</b> a guerrilla group based around Larbaa south of Algiers, from 1982 to 1987.|$|R
50|$|Syed Saleem Shahzad {{covered a}} variety of topics through his career, {{including}} global security issues, Pakistani <b>armed</b> forces, <b>Islamic</b> <b>movements,</b> and Muslim resistance movements in Lebanon and Iraq. The Taliban and Al-Qaeda were the regular topics of his writing. He was an international journalist who travelled widely in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. He also wrote for Le Monde Diplomatique (France), La Stampa (Italy) and Dawn (Pakistan). He was South Asia Correspondent for Italian news agency Adnkronos International (AKI).

5000|$|They formed {{themselves}} into various armed groups, principally the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA), based {{primarily in the}} mountains, and the more hard-line <b>Armed</b> <b>Islamic</b> Group (GIA), based primarily in the towns. The GIA motto was [...] "no agreement, no truce, no dialogue" [...] and declared war on the FIS in 1994 after it made progress in negotiations with the government. The MIA and various smaller insurgent bands regrouped, becoming the FIS-loyalist Islamic Salvation Army (AIS).|$|R
50|$|According to Algerian {{veterans}} of the Afghan jihad who founded the GIA, the idea of forming an armed group to fight jihad against the Algerian government was developed not after the coup but in 1989 after leaders of the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) of Mustafa Bouyali, were freed from prison, but was not acted on due to the spectacular electoral political success of the FIS.|$|R
50|$|He {{declared}} his group {{independent of the}} existing <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA) in January 1993. He was arrested in Morocco and {{handed over to the}} Algerian authorities on 29 September 1993. He was sentenced to death in June 1995. He claims to regret the killing of innocent civilians for which the GIA became notorious, blaming it on his successors who controlled the GIA while he was in prison.|$|R
5000|$|Beside's the GIA, {{the other}} major branch of the Algerian {{resistance}} was the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier [...] "General" [...] Abdelkader Chebouti, and was [...] "well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad" [...] targeting {{the state and its}} representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing.|$|R
5000|$|Early in 1992, Mansour Meliani, {{a former}} aid to Bouyali, {{along with many}} [...] "Afghans", broke with his former friend Abdelkader Heresay and left the MIA (<b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement),</b> {{founding}} his own Jihadi group around July 1992. Meliani was arrested in July and executed in August 1993. Meliani was replaced by Mohammed Allal, aka Moh Leveilley, who was killed on 1 September 1992 by the Algerian military when they attacked a meeting held to unify command of the jihad.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1982, Bouyali {{took to the}} maquis, with {{significant}} support in local towns, particularly Larbaa. The [...] "Group for Defense against the Illicit" [...] announced its transformation into the Algerian <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MAIA). According to the government, it planned a variety of attacks, including {{the assassination of the}} Prime Minister, which were forestalled by the arrest of 23 of its members in mid-December. Further arrests were made in January 1983. However, Bouyali himself evaded the security forces, and fled abroad (probably either Iran or Libya).|$|R
5000|$|The {{first major}} armed {{movement}} to emerge, starting {{almost immediately after}} the coup, was the <b>Islamic</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Movement</b> (MIA). It was led by the ex-soldier [...] "General" [...] Abdelkader Chebouti, a longstanding Islamist. The MIA was [...] "well-organized and structured and favored a long-term jihad" [...] targeting {{the state and its}} representatives and based on a guerrilla campaign like that of the War of Independence. From prison, Ali Benhadj issued a fatwa giving the MIA his blessing. In February 1992, ex-soldier, ex-Afghan fighter, and former FIS head of security Said Mekhloufi founded the <b>Movement</b> for an <b>Islamic</b> State (MEI).|$|R
