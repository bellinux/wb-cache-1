5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public <b>and</b> <b>multilateral</b> underwriters, private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007.

MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E

The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations was created in 1992 to support this increased demand for such missions.|$|E
