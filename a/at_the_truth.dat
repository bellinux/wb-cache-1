5|$|In November 1966 Life {{published}} {{a series of}} photographs from the film that Abraham Zapruder took of the Kennedy assassination. Alvarez, an expert in optics and photoanalysis, became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could {{be learned from the}} film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was fully consistent with his being shot from behind. He also investigated the timing of the gunshots and the shockwave which disturbed the camera, and the speed of the camera, pointing out a number of things which the FBI photoanalysts either overlooked or got wrong. He produced a paper intended as a tutorial, with informal advice for the physicist intent on arriving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the view}} of al-Kindi, prophecy and {{philosophy}} were two different routes to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> He contrasts the two positions in four ways. Firstly, while a person must undergo {{a long period of}} training and study to become a philosopher, prophecy is bestowed upon someone by God. Secondly, the philosopher must arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> by his own devices (and with great difficulty), whereas the prophet has the truth revealed to him by God. Thirdly, the understanding of the prophet – being divinely revealed – is clearer and more comprehensive than that of the philosopher. Fourthly, {{the way in which the}} prophet is able to express this understanding to the ordinary people is superior. Therefore, al-Kindi says the prophet is superior in two fields: the ease and certainty with which he receives the truth, and the way in which he presents it. However, the crucial implication is that the content of the prophet's and the philosopher's knowledge is the same. This, says Adamson, demonstrates how limited the superiority al-Kindi afforded to prophecy was.|$|E

25|$|At {{one point}} in the proceedings, Smith {{attempted}} to press a point he was making, by quoting from a signal sent to British ships. Lord Mersey queried which message this was, and it transpired that the message in question existed in the version of evidence given to Smith by the Board of Trade Solicitor, Sir Ellis Cunliffe, but not in versions given to others. Cunliffe explained the discrepancy by saying that different versions of the papers had been prepared for use, depending whether the enquiry had been in camera or not, but the message quoted appeared never to have existed. Lord Mersey observed that it was his job to get <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> and thereafter became more critical of Admiralty evidence.|$|E
25|$|As the Dravanians {{prepare to}} resume their siege of Ishgard, Alphinaud {{suggests}} that they use Lady Iceheart to broker peace with Nidhogg through negotiation. Estinien offers his lance to aid this endeavor, promising to slay the great wyrm if words come to blows. Iceheart reveals that she too possesses the Echo {{and used it to}} glimpse <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> behind the war. Born Ysayle, she took the name Iceheart after communing with the soul of Shiva, the mortal woman whose love for the great wyrm Hraesvelgr allowed man and dragon to coexist peacefully for two hundred years. Yet the Elezen grew envious of the dragons' power and conspired to steal Nidhogg's eye, the source of his strength. This, she claims, is the origin of the Dragonsong War. Aiming to avoid further bloodshed, Ysayle agrees to take the party to parley with Hraesvelgr for his aid in ending the war.|$|E

500|$|Born in Pretoria {{and raised}} in poverty in Cape Town, Ames {{became the first woman}} to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town in 1964. [...] Ames [...] studied the effects of {{cannabis}} on the brain and published several articles on the subject; seeing the therapeutic benefits of cannabis on patients in her own hospital, she became an early proponent of legalization for medicinal use. [...] She headed the neurology department at Groote Schuur Hospital before retiring in 1985, but continued to lecture at Valkenberg and Alexandra Hospital. After apartheid was finally dismantled in 1994, Ames testified <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> and Reconciliation Commission about her work on the [...] "Biko doctors" [...] medical ethics inquiry. [...] In 1999, Nelson Mandela awarded Ames the Star of South Africa, the country's highest civilian award, in recognition of her work on behalf of human rights.|$|E

2500|$|During Operation Pillar of Defense, Im Tirtzu {{published}} {{an open letter}} in American Jewish newspapers addressed to the New Israel Fund chair. The letter gave examples of NIF funded organizations that Im Tirtzu said accused Israel of war crimes, and asked if the NIF agrees with their accusations. The NIF rebutted Im Tirtzu's charges, stating, [...] "Not one {{of the human rights}} organizations Im Tirtzu attacks accused Israel of war crimes in the recent Gaza action." [...] NIF also quoted Avichai Mandelblit, the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: [...] "The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative.... I'm trying to get <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> and they really help us do that. Our cooperation with B'tselem [...] stands out. They help us to speak with witnesses, to investigate complaints ... with all of the criticism from these organizations on us, their goal is to get to the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{charge that}} missionaries have {{manifested}} an improper {{desire to see}} vengeance done on the perpetrators of last year's outrages is, except in possible isolated cases, as unfounded as Mark Twain's ignorant charges against Dr. Ament and his colleagues in Peking and its vicinity. Men who have examined the whole question with an honest desire to arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> without prejudice or partiality allow that the behaviour of the missionaries as a body has not only been above reproach, but worthy of praise and gratitude. They have been anxious, as we have all been anxious, to see outrages {{such as those of}} last year made impossible in the future, and as long as human nature is what it is, men must be deterred from crime by the conviction that it will be followed by punishment and not to have punished, and punished severely, the culprits of last year, would have been to invite a repetition of their crimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus disguised, Jacob {{entered his}} father's room. Surprised to {{perceive}} that Esau was back so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the [...] your God arranged it for me"; Rashi (on [...] ) says Isaac's suspicions were aroused because Esau never used the personal name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could feel him, but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] (27:22). Still trying to get <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> Isaac asked him point-blank, [...] "Are you really my son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am" [...] (which can be taken as [...] "I am me", not [...] "I am Esau"). Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then he blessed him with the dew of the heavens, the fatness of the earth, and rulership over many nations as well as his own brother.|$|E
2500|$|The families' lawyer, Des Collins, said: [...] "Prior to the trial, {{the council}} {{maintained}} that {{a thorough investigation}} had led it {{to the conclusion that}} there was no link between the reclamation work and the children's birth defects. It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial. Today that link has been established and the evidence provided. The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pre-trial promises without delay." [...] Collins said of the legal battle: [...] "I've been made out to be a shyster and an ambulance-chaser. The council has stonewalled, obstructed and prevaricated all the way through this. They didn't need to. If they'd ever said to us, 'Look, we're not admitting liability, but we'll co-operate with you to find out what really happened', I wouldn't have minded. Instead, they tried to shut us out and paint us as the baddies... They've tried at every turn to stop us getting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Now they claim they can't afford to pay. I'm not impressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many anecdotes of Diogenes {{refer to}} his dog-like behavior, and his praise of a dog's virtues. It {{is not known}} whether Diogenes was insulted with the epithet [...] "doggish" [...] and made a virtue of it, or whether he first took up the dog theme himself. When asked why he was called a dog he replied, [...] "I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals." [...] Diogenes {{believed}} human beings live artificially and hypocritically and {{would do well to}} study the dog. Besides performing natural body functions in public with ease, a dog will eat anything, and make no fuss about where to sleep. Dogs live in the present without anxiety, and have no use for the pretensions of abstract philosophy. In addition to these virtues, dogs are thought to know instinctively who is friend and who is foe. Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Diogenes stated that [...] "other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." ...|$|E

Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!"

[...] Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. [...] As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac's blessing: [...] "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: [...] Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." ...|$|E
