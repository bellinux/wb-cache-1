500|$|In April 2016, the ABC-owned {{cable network}} Freeform {{announced}} Marvel's Cloak & Dagger, {{based on the}} characters of the same name, with a straight-to-series order for 2018. The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults <b>and</b> <b>together</b> <b>we</b> could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways. In November 2017, it was announced that New Warriors would no longer air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his earlier}} years, {{at least from}} the 1960s to the 1980s, Guthrie had taken a decidedly leftist {{approach}} to American politics. [...] In his often lengthy comments during concerts his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-Nixon, pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal. [...] However, he apparently regarded himself as more an individualist than the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song [...] "Prologue": [...] "I can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations, ... <b>and</b> <b>together</b> <b>we</b> sang our victory songs though we were worlds apart." [...] A 1969 rewrite of [...] "Alice's Restaurant" [...] pokes fun at then-former President Lyndon Johnson and his staff.|$|E
2500|$|Project leader Colonel S. and {{his team}} in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) had very little spare time, and only on the {{weekends}} could they think of an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S., [...] "The first name I thought of was 'Anti-Qassam', but when the project started to move forward I realized it was problematic... I sat down with my wife, <b>and</b> <b>together</b> <b>we</b> thought of suitable names. She suggested the name 'Tamir' (Hebrew acronym for טיל מיירט, Til Meyaret, 'interceptor missile') for the missile, and for the system itself we thought of 'Golden Dome'. The following Sunday, 'Tamir' was immediately approved, {{but there was a}} problem with 'Golden Dome'—it could be perceived as ostentatious. So it was changed to 'Iron Dome'." ...|$|E
