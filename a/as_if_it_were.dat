5|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, atomic theory is a scientific {{theory of the}} nature of matter, which states that matter is composed of discrete units called atoms. It began as a philosophical concept in ancient Greece and entered the scientific mainstream in the early 19th century when discoveries in the field of chemistry showed that matter did indeed behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> made up of atoms.|$|E

5|$|It often also {{falls in}} the same range for {{reaction}} order, resembling terbium and dysprosium in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius {{may be attributed to}} the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do {{not pose a}} significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only {{to the surface of}} bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of physics}} apply the abstractions of {{mathematics}} to the real world, often <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> perfect. For example, a crystal is perfect when it has no structural defects such as dislocations and is fully symmetric. Exact mathematical perfection can only approximate real objects. Visible patterns in nature are governed by physical laws; for example, meanders can be explained using fluid dynamics.|$|E
