40|$|In America, {{there are}} a lot of Korean Churches for Korean people. Among them, the churches of Korean {{students}} are different from the churches of Korean immigrants because they have different purposes coming to America. In Korean student churches most members are students and they are preparing to be a leader for the future and for the glory of God. Therefore, the churches of Korean students have to focus on ministry of sowing.

5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E

5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme Court could not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E

5|$|The Staffordshire Regiment {{only had}} a {{separate}} existence from 1959–2007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, Delivering Security in <b>a</b> <b>Changing</b> World, the regiment was merged with the Cheshire Regiment and the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment to form the Mercian Regiment. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E

In between turns, the player {{has the opportunity to}} request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.|$|E

5|$|The venue was confiscated by the German {{occupation}} forces during World War II, {{who built}} a {{cold storage facility}} south of the pitch. In 1945, {{after five years of}} occupation, the pitch was in a detrimental state. The stadium received a major renovation, including a new pitch and replacing half the wooden terraces with concrete stands. The cold facility was converted to a club house and a basement was dug out and used as <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> room. In 1946, parts of Vang, including Briskebyen, were amalgamated with Hamar. The same year, Hamar Municipality signed an agreement with the club whereby municipal subsidies would cover the operating costs in exchange for the club allocating training time to other clubs.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose's {{finances}} {{entered the}} second half of the century in poor shape, and considerably worse than the period between 1930 and 1931, slipping relative to other colleges from 3rd to 8th. But they were improved during Last's tenure, along with undergraduate admissions; the college showed a surplus in 1952–53, and income in 1957 (£104,000) was double what it had been in 1938. Pay for fellows was still poor, and they were small in number compared to other colleges. There was a sizeable entertainment budget, however, something which, combined with the long hours, have contributed to short lifespans. Only in 1987 did a sitting fellow reach retirement age. Last resigned as Principal in 1956, dying shortly after. Turnover was considerable, although some fellows stayed on: Maurice Platnauer became Principal in 1956, and retired in 1960; he was replaced by Sir Noel Hall. Hall's tenure was troubled, not externally, but rather from Hall's patchy knowledge of the college and staff; his selection, faute de mieux, was sometimes questioned, although he remained well-liked. However, the college, which had thus far stayed assured, found itself in <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> environment. Herbert Hart, however, Principal between 1973 and 1978, was the first to be elected from outside Brasenose. Lord Windlesham, made principal in 1989, was the first to hold Cabinet Office.|$|E
5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by <b>a</b> <b>changing</b> lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E
