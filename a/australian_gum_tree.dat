50|$|At {{the famous}} Coubertin Foundation, just outside Paris, Kelly created his iconic 'Cow up a Tree' {{sculpture}}, an 8-metre high, four ton bronze sculpture that reproduces Dobell's camouflage cows upside down, {{high in the}} branches of an <b>Australian</b> <b>gum</b> <b>tree.</b> This surreal sculpture, based on flood imagery from Australia, caused a Parisian sensation and was commented upon in worldwide media including in The Times, 'Cows and debris put Paris back on modern art map' (Charles Bremmer, 14, Sept. 1999), Time magazine the BBC and almost all the French media. This sculpture, one of three in the edition travelled back to Melbourne {{where it has been}} on permanent public exhibition as part of Melbourne’s Docklands precinct. The second sculpture has been exhibited at The Hague Sculpture Festival, Glastonbury Festival (2007), where it features in a Kaiser Chief's music video 'When the Heat Dies Down', and in 2007/08 Musee de Arte Moderne et Contemporain (MAMAC) in France where it was juxtaposed against the work of Alexander Calder and Niki de Saint Phalle.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Hans Heysen [...] (8 October 18772 July 1968) was a German-born Australian artist. He {{became a}} {{household}} name for his watercolours of monumental <b>Australian</b> <b>gum</b> <b>trees.</b> Heysen also produced images of men and animals toiling in the Australian bush, as well as groundbreaking depictions of arid landscapes in the Flinders Ranges. He won the Wynne Prize for landscape painting a record nine times.|$|R
50|$|Invasive species, {{such as the}} <b>Australian</b> blue <b>gum</b> <b>tree,</b> olive tree, {{sweet fennel}} and Harding grass {{threaten}} native species through competition for light, nutrients, and water. The <b>Australian</b> blue <b>gum,</b> for example, releases toxins in its leaf litter which prevents other species of plants from growing in the soil surrounding it. The blue gum, {{as well as other}} species including the Harding grass, are much more flammable and better adapted to wildfires than native species.|$|R

40|$|The {{fraction}} and {{the distribution}} of the personal daily solar erythemal UV exposure were assessed for the shade provided by <b>Australian</b> <b>gum</b> <b>trees</b> {{in each of the four}} seasons to allow evaluation of the reduction in the personal UV exposure in tree shade over a year. The personal annual erythemal UV exposures in the tree shade ranged from 2, 510 SED (Standard Erythema Dose) for the vertical part of the ear to 8, 016 SED for the vertex of the head compared to 14, 834 SED to a horizontal plane in full sun. The erythemal UV seasonal exposures for 15 minute intervals on a horizontal plane in full sun in winter are comparable to the UV exposure to the vertex of the head in shade in autumn and spring. The UV exposure in the tree shade for summer, is approximately 20 % less than the full sun exposure in autumn. The reduced personal annual erythemal UV exposures due to the tree shade provided reductions by a factor of 2 to 3 and 4 to 6 in the contribution to the risk of basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas respectively compared to not employing the protection of the tree shade. ...|$|R
50|$|The ranch {{began as}} a dry-land wheat farm owned by the San Fernando Homestead Association led by Isaac Lankershim and Isaac Van Nuys. Albert Workman, an Australian immigrant, began as the {{superintendent}} of Van Nuys' Los Angeles Farm and Milling Company. After 1869 Workman purchased the 9000 acre ranch, and cultivated it with another 4000 acre nearby. The ranch also had a thousand head of cattle at one time. Workman imported <b>Australian</b> Blue <b>Gum</b> eucalyptus <b>tree</b> seeds from his homeland and planted them on the ranch. Some claim the numerous eucalyptus trees in California of that species, Eucalyptus globulus, originate from the Workman Ranch groves.|$|R

50|$|The <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil is {{of little}} {{economic}} significance in Australia where it has natural enemies. In other countries where Eucalyptus has been introduced, {{that is not the}} case. Adult <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevils feed mostly on leaves and the soft bark of twigs while the larvae feed mostly on leaves. Heavy infestations cause die back of shoots which may result in the development of epicormic shoots. Repeated defoliations may cause the splitting and death of branches or even whole trees. The egg parasite Anaphes nitens, a wasp which is native to Australia, has been introduced to other countries as a biological control agent to control the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil. This has been successful in Mauritius where in two years, incidence of the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> weevil has been much reduced. More recently, successful control has also been obtained in Italy and France, and in Spain.|$|R

40|$|Sudan is {{the most}} {{important}} of the gum arabic producing countries, with 80 % of the market. The Sudanese farmer grows millet for five years on his field and then plants <b>gum</b> <b>trees.</b> These help to refertilize the land as the <b>gum</b> <b>tree</b> is leguminous and fixes atmospheric nitrogen in the soil. This fallow period lasts about 15 years during which the farmer gets a profit from his land by harvesting the gum, {{and at the same time}} puts fertility back into his soil. At the end of the period when the trees are no longer productive, millet can be grown again for five or six years. A further advantage of this system is that gum can be collected during the dry season when other agricultural activity is minimal.
