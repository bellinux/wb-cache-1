5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E

25|$|Like nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy, Mössbauer spectroscopy probes tiny changes in the energy levels of an atomic nucleus in response to its environment. Typically, three types of nuclear interactions may be observed: an isomeric shift, {{also known as a}} chemical shift; quadrupole splitting; and magnetic splittings due to the Zeeman effect or hyperfine splitting. Due to the high energy and extremely narrow line widths of gamma rays, Mössbauer spectroscopy is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> technique in terms of energy (and hence frequency) resolution, capable of detecting change in just a few parts per 1011.|$|E
25|$|The Pharaoh Hound is independent-minded, highly intelligent, and {{occasionally}} stubborn, yet very trainable when positive methods are used.

25|$|Buddhism {{sees the}} {{experience}} of dying as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> moment in one's spiritual life because the quality of one's mind {{at the time of}} death is believed to condition one's future rebirth. The Buddhist ideal is to die in a calm but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the Bardo Thodol is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.|$|E
25|$|The coastal ice {{cliffs of}} Brown Glacier and Stephenson Glacier, which in 1954 were over 50 feet high, had {{disappeared}} by 1963 when the glaciers terminated {{as much as}} 100 yards inland. Baudissin Glacier on the north coast, and Vahsel Glacier {{on the west coast}} have lost at least 100 and 200 vertical feet of ice, respectively. Winston Glacier, which retreated approximately one mile between 1947 and 1963, appears to be <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> indicator of glacier change on the island. The young moraines flanking Winston Lagoon show that Winston Glacier has lost at least 300 vertical feet of ice within a recent time period.|$|E
25|$|The popes, {{and also}} the Senate when it coined money, appear to have used the {{imperial}} mint of Rome, which was on {{the slope of the}} Campidoglio, not far from the Arch of Septimius Severus; but in the fifteenth century the mint was near the bank of Santo Spirito. Finally, in 1665, Alexander VII moved it {{to the rear of the}} apse of St. Peter's. Bernini invented for it a machine to do the work more rapidly, and Francesco Girardini furnished <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> balance; so that the mint of Rome was technically the most perfect one of those times.

25|$|On 20 March 2003, Spanish Prime Minister, José María Aznar, UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, {{president}} of the Unites States George W. Bush, and Prime Minister of Portugal, José Manuel Durão Barroso as host, met in the Azores, to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and Spain's potential involvement in the war, {{as well as the}} beginning of the invasion. This encounter was extremely controversial in Spain, even now remaining <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> point for the Aznar government. Almost a year later, Madrid suffered the worst terrorist attack in Europe since the Lockerbie bombing, motivated by Spain's decision to participate in the Iraq war, prompting some Spaniards to accuse the Prime Minister of being responsible.|$|E
25|$|Identifying {{skeletal}} remains is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> research subject at the farm. With {{a new age}} and generation, {{there has been a}} paradigm shift in methods to identify the entrails of victims. With innovations and adaptation to change, computers are able to identify properties of bone matter that has been buried years beginning at the Forensic Anthropology Data Bank founded in 1986 at the University of Texas, which houses thousands of detailed measurements of skeletons. This data provides strong evidence that shows differences in ethnic background from ancient times to present today. Along with the data bank, technological innovations have given researchers a computer tool called FORDISC. This program is used to evaluate subtleties in a bone sample on a much smaller scale, which can confirm or challenge theories and/or conclusions drawn by investigators.|$|E
25|$|In the {{investigations}} on radiant heat in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, {{the result is the}} ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).|$|E

500|$|On the one hand, {{the relief}} of MacArthur {{established}} a precedent that generals and admirals could be fired for any public or private disagreement with government policy. In 1977, Major General John K. Singlaub publicly criticized proposed cuts {{in the size of}} American forces in South Korea, and was summarily relieved by President Jimmy Carter for making statements [...] "inconsistent with announced national security policy." [...] During the Gulf War in 1990, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney relieved the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Michael Dugan, for showing [...] "poor judgment at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>sensitive</b> time" [...] in making a series of statements to the media during a visit to Saudi Arabia. [...] General Stanley A. McChrystal was sacked by President Barack Obama in 2009 after McChrystal and his staff made disparaging remarks about senior civilian government officials in an article published in Rolling Stone magazine. This elicited comparisons with MacArthur, as the war in Afghanistan was not going well. On the other hand, Major General James N. Post III was relieved and issued a letter of reprimand in 2015 for discouraging personnel under his command from communicating with the Congress, which he described as [...] "treason".|$|E
