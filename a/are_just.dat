5|$|M-212 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Second Street and the Tromble Trail {{north of the}} entrance to Aloha State Park {{in the community of}} Aloha. The community was originally a stop on the Detroit and Mackinac Railway that was named after a trip to Hawaii by the local sawmill owner. Progressing eastward, M-212 intersects with Third Street and Fourth Street, both of which <b>are</b> <b>just</b> separated by woodlands and residences. To the north of the highway, there is all woodlands and residences. To the south, there <b>are</b> <b>just</b> a few residences. After a while, there is a large clearing, which gives way to a farm to the north and more residences to the south. After the farm there is a large field and M-212 terminates at an intersection with M-33 in Aloha Township.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} a {{different}} system in terms of rewarding experience points. It rewards experience points for killing enemies, but only until their respective entries in the bestiary are completed.

5|$|Ashburton Playing Fields <b>are</b> <b>just</b> off Shirley Road, {{behind the}} school.

Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon, concerned about the large crowds, the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as playing fields.|$|E
5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or <b>are</b> <b>just</b> not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E

5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of vibrational signals <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E

5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley. It {{consists of the}} view that mental phenomena are causally ineffectual, where one or more mental states {{do not have any}} influence on physical states or mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena. Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they <b>are</b> <b>just</b> causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world. This view has been defended most strongly in recent times by Frank Jackson.|$|E
