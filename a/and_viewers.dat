40|$|Studies {{of adults}} provide {{evidence}} that spatial reasoning is non-unitary in nature, consisting of separate object transformation <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation abilities. This research examined {{the presence of this}} dissociation in children. Participants between 8 and 12 years of age, divided over three age groups (i. e., 65 children from 7. 5 to 9 years old, 75 children from 9 to 10. 5 years old, and 77 children from 10. 5 to 12 years old) performed a battery of object <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation tasks. Analysis of variance showed that performance improved with age on the individual object <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation tasks, with the largest effects between 10. 5 and 12 years of age. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses to test the dissociation of object <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation ability over the different age groups revealed that in children under 10. 5 years of age object <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation ability could not be differentiated. A dissociation between object <b>and</b> <b>viewer</b> transformation ability was shown between 10. 5 and 12 years of age. This period of specialization of spatial abilities may be a particularly interesting time window for identifying spatial talents and providing spatial training and intervention...|$|R

5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers {{and not enough}} young viewers {{put pressure on the}} WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{information}} available on the allegations was released (officially or unofficially) by the prosecution and unchallenged by Jackson. Jackson was largely portrayed as guilty by the media. The media bias {{was evident in the}} use of sensational headlines to draw in readers <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> when the content itself did not support the headline, the purchasing of stories of his alleged criminal activity, the purchasing of confidential leaked material from the police investigation, deliberately using pictures of his appearance at its worst, using headlines that strongly implied his guilt, and a general lack of objectivity.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} a success, earning {{a total of}} $141.2 million worldwide, {{exceeding}} the earnings of the three previous Bond films. In 1966, John Stears won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and production designer Ken Adam was also nominated for a BAFTA award. Thunderball is the most financially successful film of the series when adjusting for ticket price inflation. Some critics <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> showered praise on the film and branded it a welcome addition to the series, while others complained of the repetitively monotonous aquatic action and prolonged length. In 1983, Warner Bros. released a second film adaptation of the novel under the title Never Say Never Again, with McClory as executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E

5|$|In October 2013, {{cast member}} Colette Mann, who plays Sheila Canning, {{revealed}} that her character's daughter {{was going to}} be introduced. Producers decided to bring in another member of Sheila's family as they wanted to explore her background further. The producers were also keen to introduce a character similar to Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte), who would provoke strong reactions among the characters <b>and</b> <b>viewers.</b> Mann added that the role {{was in the process of}} being cast and the character would arrive the following year. On 30 December 2013, it was announced that New Zealand actress Morgana O'Reilly had been cast as Naomi. O'Reilly attended two rounds of auditions before being cast. She and her husband filmed her first audition in their garden in Sydney, before O'Reilly flew to Melbourne to audition in the studio, alongside Mann and Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson).|$|E
5|$|Mark's early storylines often {{revolved}} around {{his relationship with}} Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer). He was initially wary of getting involved with Kate because of her ex-boyfriend, Declan Napier (Erin Mullally), and the age gap between them. Mark's focus on his work eventually forced him to choose between Kate and Paul's case. Following {{the end of his}} relationship with Kate, Mark had a one-night stand with her best friend Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita). He also faced problems at work after reporting a fellow officer for corruption, which led to his life being threatened. Mark left for witness protection during a special real-time episode. Mark later returned during an eclipse and tried to win Kate back. Following her death, he embarked on a relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) and three members of his family were introduced. The character has been mostly well received by critics <b>and</b> <b>viewers</b> during his time on the show.|$|E

Ben Stiller won two comedy awards for his performance and the film was chosen as the Favorite Comedy Motion Picture at the 2001 People's Choice Awards.

Meet the Parents also inspired a reality television show titled Meet My Folks and a situation comedy titled In-Laws, both of them debuting on NBC in 2002.|$|E
