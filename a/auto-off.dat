5000|$|Light LC (Lightness Control) Server & Light LC Setup Server, {{representing}} a light control device, {{able to control}} Light Lightness model using an occupancy sensor and ambient light sensor. It {{may be used for}} light control scenarios like Auto-On, <b>Auto-Off</b> and/or Daylight Harvesting.|$|E
50|$|GS Standard- Choice of {{five-speed}} manual or a four-speed Sportronic automatic transmission, a 140-watt (max.) Mitsubishi CD/MP3-compatible {{audio system}} with six speakers, 17-inch alloy wheels, an anti-theft immobilizer, <b>auto-off</b> halogen headlamps, power windows/locks/mirrors, air conditioning, a split fold-down rear seat, two 12-volt accessory outlets, anti-lock brakes, a rear spoiler, and a six airbag safety system.|$|E

Mitsubishi CD/MP3-compatible {{audio system}} with six speakers, 17-inch alloy wheels, an anti-theft immobilizer, <b>auto-off</b> halogen headlamps, fog lamps, power windows/locks/mirrors, air-conditioning, a split fold-down rear seat, two 12-volt accessory outlets, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes, a rear spoiler, dual-stage six airbag safety system, traction control, a front strut tower bar, and a center display with outside temperature and compass readings.|$|E
50|$|In October 1997, AlphaSmart, Inc. {{introduced}} {{the third generation}} of the AlphaSmart family, the AlphaSmart 2000. Along with a more ergonomic design, {{the case of the}} AlphaSmart 2000 was curvy and blue. New features added were spell-checking, direct printing (allowing a user to plug into a printer directly, bypassing a computer), <b>auto-off</b> power save, and a keyboarding timer. A year later, the company added infrared capability to the 2000, enabling users to transfer text to a computer or another AlphaSmart without a cable. This model needed 3 AA batteries, but could still use the original rechargeable NiCd battery pack. Like the Alphasmart Pro, it had a 128 kB memory.|$|E
50|$|The Berlina and Calais luxury {{models were}} not badged or marketed as Commodores and the Calais was only {{offered as a}} sedan. Apart from greater {{standard}} interior features as listed above plus such things as map lamps, footwell lamps, programmable interior dimming lights, <b>auto-off</b> lamp function, speed sensitive windscreen wipers (and, for Calais, including a woodgrain-look gear gate, chrome-look door handles, door lamps), the key differentiating exterior features of these luxury-oriented models relative to Executive and Acclaim included chrome-look grilles, side mouldings and bumper bars with chrome-look strips, chrome exhaust tips. In addition, the Calais featured lower skirt area of the Calais in contrasting paint (for a dual tone effect), chrome-look window mouldings, front fog lights, clear rear side indicators.|$|E
50|$|The center showcases {{a variety}} of environmentally-friendly {{technologies}} that provide opportunities to learn how construction and operations can {{be sensitive to the}} surrounding environment. The nearly 11000 sq ft facility is certified by the U.S. Green Building Council as LEED Silver. The center utilizes a closed-loop geothermal heating and cooling system and also has a living/green roof, composed of 6 - 8 in of soil substrate and native plants of the park. The roof absorbs and filters approximately 1000000 gal of water annually, and during rain events slowly releases the water into adjacent biodetention areas over the course of hours and days, thus decreasing the volume of water that contributes to flash-flooding of the nearby streams. The 60-vehicle parking lot is permeable and allows water to slowly absorb in the ground, while recharging the local aquifer. Various other technologies in the building include light sensitive overhead lighting which automatically adjusts to daylight levels, as well as <b>auto-off</b> lights, and light shelves in the classrooms allow reflected sunlight to penetrate deeper into the building, saving electricity architectural light shelf. Flash heaters are installed in building faucets negating the need for inefficient water heaters. Park trails are paved in part with locally derived reused asphalt millings containing 6 percent pulverized glass.|$|E
40|$|An {{energy-efficient}} voltage buffer for a low-dropout regulator (LDO) {{is presented}} in this paper. The voltage buffer contains a current-boosting circuit with quick-on and <b>auto-off</b> features {{so that it can}} momentarily provide an extra current to charge and discharge the large gate capacitance of the power transistor. The voltage buffer is therefore able to increase the slew rate at the gate of the power transistor, whereas the quiescent current of the LDO remains constantly low in the steady state. Moreover, the proposed current-boosting circuit has a capacitive shunt feedback network to improve the loop bandwidth of the LDO. The proposed voltage buffer is applied to an LDO implemented in a 0. 35 -μm CMOS technology. The LDO operates at a 2 -V supply, and the regulated voltage is 1. 8 V. The maximum output current is 100 mA. The measured quiescent current is about 4 μA. The load transient deviation of the regulated voltage is small. The proposed voltage buffer can effectively reduce the transient voltage spikes. © 2010 IEEE...|$|E
