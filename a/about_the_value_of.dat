5|$|Roark {{is arrested}} and his action is widely condemned, but Wynand decides {{to use his}} papers to defend his friend. This unpopular stance hurts the {{circulation}} of his newspapers, and Wynand's employees go on strike after Wynand dismisses Toohey for disobeying him and criticizing Roark. Faced {{with the prospect of}} closing the paper, Wynand gives in and publishes a denunciation of Roark. At his trial, Roark makes a speech <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> ego and integrity, and he is found not guilty. Dominique leaves Wynand for Roark. Wynand, who has betrayed his own values by attacking Roark, finally grasps the nature of the power he thought he held. He shuts down the Banner and commissions a final building from Roark, a skyscraper that will serve as a monument to human achievement. Eighteen months later, the Wynand Building is under construction. Dominique, now Roark's wife, enters the site to meet him atop its steel framework.|$|E
5|$|The reformers were {{especially}} active at the Byberry Hospital in Philadelphia where four Friends initiated The Attendant magazine {{as a way}} to communicate ideas and promote reform. This periodical later became The Psychiatric Aide, a professional journal for mental health workers. On May 6, 1946 Life Magazine printed an exposé of the mental healthcare system based on the reports of COs. Another effort of CPS, Mental Hygiene Project became the National Mental Health Foundation. Initially skeptical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Civilian Public Service, Eleanor Roosevelt, impressed by the changes introduced by COs in the mental health system, became a sponsor of the National Mental Health Foundation and actively inspired other prominent citizens including Owen J. Roberts, Pearl Buck and Harry Emerson Fosdick to join her in advancing the organization's objectives of reform and humane treatment of patients.|$|E

This was an 8-player double round robin tournament, the same format as {{was used for the}} FIDE World Chess Championship 2005.

Because Anand's World Chess Champion title was won in a tournament rather than a match, a {{minority}} of commentators questioned the validity of his title. Kramnik also made ambiguous comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Anand's title, but did not claim the title himself.

25|$|The U.S. Army Air Service had a {{brief but}} {{turbulent}} history. Created during World War I by executive order of 28th President Woodrow Wilson after American entrance in April 1917 as {{the increasing use of}} airplanes and the military uses of aviation were readily apparent as the war continued to its climax, the U.S. Army Air Service gained permanent legislative authority in 1920 as a combatant arm of the line of the United States Army. There followed a six-year struggle between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> an independent Air Force, intensified by struggles for funds caused by skimpy budgets, as much an impetus for independence as any other factor.|$|E
25|$|The seven-year {{history of}} the post-war Air Service was marked by a {{prolonged}} debate between adherents of airpower and the supporters of the traditional military services <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> an independent Air Force. Airmen such as Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell supported the concept. The Army's senior leadership from World War I, the United States Navy, {{and the majority of}} the nation's political leadership favored integration of all military aviation into the Army and Navy. Aided by a wave of pacifism following the war that drastically cut military budgets, opponents of an independent air force prevailed. The Air Service was renamed the Army Air Corps in 1926 as a compromise in the continuing struggle.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} 20 years {{there has been}} an overt change in the {{policies}} of governments of Mesoamerican countries towards the indigenous languages. There has been official recognition of their right to existence and some kind of governmental support, to the point of recognizing them as national languages. Bilingual (rather than monolingual Spanish) education has been recognized as desirable even if not always actually achieved in practice. In Guatemala the recognition of the indigenous languages as official languages and a valuable part of the country’s identity came after the Civil War which ended in 1996. In Mexico shifting governments had talked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the country’s indigenous heritage {{but it was not until}} 2003 that the Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages.|$|E

25|$|The Director of the Intelligence Division of the Admiralty, Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver {{established}} a code breaking organisation to decipher German signals, using cryptographers from academic backgrounds, {{making use of}} the windfalls taken from the German ships. At first, the inexperience of the cryptanalysts in naval matters led to errors {{in the understanding of}} the material, and this lack of naval experience caused Oliver to make personal decisions about the information to be passed to other departments, many of which, particularly the Operations Department, had reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Room 40. The transfer of an experienced naval officer, Commander W. W. Hope, remedied most of the deficiencies of the civilians' understanding but on 14 October, Oliver became Chief of the Naval War Staff and continued to treat Room 40 more as a fiefdom and a source for the informal group of officers around the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, which received decoded messages but had insufficient authority to use them to best advantage.|$|E

He was said to have invented histories for the instruments to explain away doubts or to increase their worth. On April 13, 2004, Axelrod was indicted in federal court in New Jersey, accused of funnelling millions of dollars into Swiss bank accounts over 20 years without paying taxes.

He was arrested in Berlin on June 15, 2004 as he got off a plane from Switzerland, and then extradited to the United States.
