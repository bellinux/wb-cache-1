40|$|A new {{coaxial antenna}} for {{microwave}} ablation therapies is proposed. The antenna design includes a miniaturized choke and an arrowhead cap to facilitate antenna insertion into the tissues. Antenna matching {{and the shape}} and dimension of the area of ablated tissue (thermal lesion) obtained in ex vivo conditions are evaluated both numerically and experimentally, finding an optimal agreement between numerical and experimental data. Results show that the antenna is well matched, {{and that it is}} able to produce a thermal lesion with an average length of 6. 5 cm and an average diameter of 4. 5 cm in ex vivo bovine liver when irradiates 60 W for 10 min. Finally, the dependence of antenna performances on possible changes in the antenna's structure is investigated, finding an optimal stability with respect to manufacturing tolerances and highlighting the fundamental role played by the <b>antenna's</b> <b>choke...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — An {{advanced}} feed for a mm-wave short-range exposure {{system is}} reported. The feed configuration is optimized {{to provide a}} highly-uniform illumination of biological samples positioned close to the antenna aperture. The prototype of the antenna is fabricated in metallized foam and measured. Its near-field characteristics are studied using the infrared imaging technique. The significant advantages of the reported <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna</b> {{in terms of the}} enhanced exposure efficiency, improved exposure uniformity, and reduced exposure distance, are demonstrated via comparison with standard open-ended waveguide and horn <b>antennas.</b> Keywords—bioelectromagnetics, <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna,</b> 60 GHz, dosimetry, exposure system, exposure efficiency, metallized foam I...|$|R
25|$|When {{the ground}} is not {{available}} (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces {{can serve as a}} ground plane (typically the vehicle's roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed {{at the base of the}} antenna can form a ground plane. For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and ground plane elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. For a simple 1/4-wave whip, the radials are often sloped at a 45 degree angle to bring the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms. Since this will introduce RF energy on the shield of the unbalanced feed line which deforms the radiation pattern of the <b>antenna,</b> a <b>choke</b> is often placed near the feed point.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, most notably narrow {{correlator}} spacing, {{have been developed}} to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized <b>antennas</b> (e.g., a <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna)</b> may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} method (FEM) model was employed to demonstrate important techniques used {{in the design of}} antennas for hepatic microwave ablation (MWA). To effectively treat deep-seated hepatic tumors, these antennas should produce a highly localized specific absorption rate (SAR) pattern and be efficient radiators at approved generator frequencies. Methods and results As an example, a double slot <b>choked</b> <b>antenna</b> for hepatic MWA was designed and implemented using FEMLAB™ 3. 0. Discussion This paper emphasizes the importance of factors that can affect simulation accuracy, which include boundary conditions, the dielectric properties of liver tissue, and mesh resolution. </p...|$|R
40|$|On a {{slice of}} Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_{ 8 +x} 200 ~ 300 nm thick, stacks of {{intrinsic}} Josephson junctions are patterned, connected to each other, and integrated with a bow-tie <b>antenna</b> and some <b>chokes.</b> Over an area of 150 microns by 170 microns, so far {{we are able to}} fabricate up to 256 stacks with over 11, 000 junctions. Such 3 -dimensional arrays of intrinsic Josephson junctions respond sensitively to irradiation at 760 GHz from a far-infrared laser, showing clear zero-crossing Shapiro steps up to 0. 75 V. In addition, possible applications in quantum voltage standard etc are also discussed here. The high density of integration of Josephson junctions is also promising for many other applications.

40|$|We have {{proposed}} a novel SAR system compatible with a 100 kg-class small satellite. This SAR development is funded for four years (2016 - 2019) by Japanese government. At present we are developing engineering model (EM). This paper describes the EM test preliminary results and the future plan. The specifications of SAR observation are single polarization SAR with 1 m ground resolution at minimum. A size of the satellite is 0. 7 m x 0. 7 m x 0. 7 m on a rocket. A size of the deployed antenna is 4. 9 m x 0. 7 m. Novel parallel-plate slotted array antennas made of honeycomb panel have been developed. Six outputs from GaN HEMT power amplifiers are combined in a waveguide resonator and 1 kW RF transmitting power is fed to the <b>antenna</b> trough non-contact <b>choke</b> flanges at deployable hinges (patented) ...|$|R
40|$|In the diploma thesis we {{analysed}} {{the quality}} of GNSS observations when using various antennas. We tested an internal antenna, installed into a Javad Triumph-LS housing, an external <b>antenna</b> and the <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna,</b> which is the least sensitive to the reflection of signals from objects. After the survey and quality assessment of GNSS observations in programs TEQC and Leica SPIDER QC we confirmed the presupposed hypothesis that the <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna</b> provides us best observations. In second part we checked whether {{the coverage of the}} metal barriers with white sheet or wooden panel reduces signal reflection from obstacles. We concluded that the signal mostly reflects by the metal. At the same time, we also tried to explore other factors affecting multipath size. Mostly, it is necessary {{to pay attention to the}} elevation angles and geometry of the satellites. GNSS observations were performed with static method and postprocessed in program package Leica Geo Office, where we determined the positions of points A and B in two modes: virtual reference station (VRS) and permanent station. This way, the influence of distance to reference point on quality position was tested. We concluded that the deviations were of milimeter magnitude in horizontal and of centimeter magnitude in vertical direction...|$|R
40|$|Phase center {{variations}} of the receiver and transmitter antenna constitute a remaining uncertainty in the high precision orbit determination (POD) of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites using GPS measurements. Triggered by the adoption of absolute phase patterns in the IGS processing standards, a calibration of the Sensor Systems S 67 - 1575 - 14 <b>antenna</b> with GFZ <b>choke</b> ring has been conducted that serves as POD antenna on various geodetic satellites such as CHAMP, GRACE and TerraSAR-X. Nominal phase patterns have been obtained with a robotic measurement system in a field campaign {{and the results were}} used {{to assess the impact of}} receiver antenna phase patterns on the achievable positioning accuracy. Along with this, phase center distortions in the actual spacecraft environment were characterized based on POD carrier phase residuals for the GRACE and TerraSAR-X missions. It is shown that the combined ground and in-flight calibration can improve the carrier phase modeling accuracy to a level of 4 mm which is close to the pure receiver noise. A 3. 5 cm (3 D rms) consistency of kinematic and reduced dynamic orbit determination solutions is achieved for TerraSAR-X, which presumably reflects the limitations of presently available GPS ephemeris products. The reduced dynamic solutions themselves match the observations of high grade satellite laser ranging stations to 1. 5 cm but are potentially affected by cross-track biases at the cm-level. With respect to the GPS-based relative navigation of TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X formation, the in-flight calibration of the antenna phase patterns is considered essential for an accurate modeling of differential carrier phase measurements and a mm-level baseline reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a possible method to calculate sea level variation using geodetic-quality Global Navigate Satellite System (GNSS) receivers. Three antennas are used: two small <b>antennas</b> and a <b>choke</b> ring one, analyzing only Global Positioning System signals. The main {{goal of the}} thesis is to test a modified configuration for antenna set up. In particular, measurements obtained tilting one antenna to face the horizon are compared to measurements obtained from antennas looking upward. The location of the experiment is a coastal environment nearby the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden. Sea level variations are obtained using periodogram analysis of the SNR signal and compared to synthetic gauge generated from two independent tide gauges. The <b>choke</b> ring <b>antenna</b> provides poor result, with an RMS around 6 cm and a correlation coefficients of 0. 89. The smaller antennas provide correlation coefficients around 0. 93. The antenna pointing upward present an RMS of 4. 3 cm and the one pointing the horizon an RMS of 6. 7 cm. Notable variation in the statistical parameters is found when modifying {{the length of the}} interval analyzed. In particular, doubts are risen on the reliability of certain scattered data. No relation is found between the accuracy of the method and weather conditions. Possible methods to enhance the available data are investigated, and correlation coefficient above 0. 97 can be obtained with small antennas when sacrificing data points. Hence, the results provide evidence of the suitability of SNR signal analysis for sea level variation in coastal environment even in the case of adverse weather conditions. In particular, tilted configurations provides comparable result with upward looking geodetic antennas. A SNR signal simulator is also tested to investigate its performance and usability. Various configuration are analyzed in combination with the periodogram procedure used to calculate the height of reflectors. Consistency between the data calculated and those received is found, and the overall accuracy of the height calculation program is found to be around 5 mm for input height below 5 m. The procedure is thus found to be suitable to analyze the data provided by the GNSS antennas at Onsala. ...|$|R
40|$|Vulnerability {{to radio}} {{interference}} and multipath is a wellknown drawback of satellite-based navigation systems. This is widely {{accepted as a}} critical issue for safety-of-life applications such as precision approach operations in aviation. Interference and multipath signals enter the navigation receiver through the antenna which, in order to minimise such signals, {{can be used as}} a spatial- and frequency-domain filter provided that some critical antenna parameters are controlled. The most important parameters are the shape of the antenna pattern with associated cross-polar levels and polarisation purity as well as an appropriate in and out-of-band frequency response. This paper aims at giving an overview of existing and future antenna technologies to be used with satellite navigation receivers. Also, we will consider some auxiliary technologies like resistive or high impedance ground planes which can be used in combination with antenna methods for both the above mentioned categories. Firstly, interference and multipath encountered by an aviation receiver of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are briefly discussed. The objective is to set the scene and to identify the most significant sources of radio interference, like DME (Distance Measuerment Equipment) and TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) systems, and multipath for which some antenna solutions may be provided. The critical antenna parameters for each type of interference will be identified. Secondly, existing antenna solutions and techniques used nowadays with an airborne GPS receiver are reviewed. The majority of existing GNSS antenna solutions are single element based, which usually provide low costs and low implementation complexity. We summarise the main technologies used with single antennas including helical antennas, patch antennas, stacked patch antennas and cavity backed antennas. The compatibility of the reviewed structures with the requirements to critical antenna parameters determined above will be discussed in detail. Advanced antenna systems including antenna arrays and auxiliary technologies will be presented in the paper. Such technologies are based on the use of absorbing materials or borrow from the concept of <b>choked</b> <b>antennas</b> commonly used in ground based geodesy applications. These will be discussed and assessed in view of combating interference and multipath. Array system methodologies currently used in GNSS anti-jam systems will be described and assessed. Array GNSS systems offer advanced capabilities to overcome interference at the expense of size, cost and manufacturing complexity. They are mostly used in military applications to combat intentional interference by shaping the antenna radiation pattern and placing nulls in the direction of interference. These types of antennas are commonly called CRPA´s (Controlled Radiation Pattern Arrays) due to their abilities to tailor their radiation patterns as a function of the interference threats. In this paper, we will analyse conformal array geometries with rectangular and circular grids adjusted to the airframe curvature...|$|R
