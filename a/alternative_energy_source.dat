2500|$|Airbus {{has joined}} Honeywell and JetBlue {{in an effort}} to reduce {{pollution}} and dependence on oil. They are trying to develop a biofuel that could be used by 2030. The companies propose supplying almost one third of the world's aeroplane fuel needs without affecting food resources. Algae is viewed as a possible <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> because it absorbs carbon dioxide during its growth, and because its use will not affect food production. However, algae and other vegetation-based fuels are still just experiments, and fuel-bearing algae has been expensive to develop. [...] Airbus recently operated the first alternative fuel flight on a mixture of 60% kerosene and 40% gas to liquids (GTL) fuel in one engine. It did not cut carbon emissions, but it was free of sulphur emissions. Alternative fuel was able to work properly in Airbus' aeroplane engine, demonstrating that alternative fuels should not require new aeroplane engines. This flight and the company's long term efforts are considered big strides towards environmentally friendly aeroplanes.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1790s, industrializing eastern {{population}} centers were having increasing troubles getting charcoal to fuel their growing kilns, smithies, and foundries. As local timber was denuded {{efforts to find}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> began. During a fuel shortage in Philadelphia during the War of 1812 an employee by the direction of industrialist Josiah White {{conducted a series of}} experiments and discovered a number of ways that 'rock coal' or Anthracite could be successfully ignited and burned. [...] The fuel theretofore, had been seen more as a way to put out a fire, than a fuel to build one up, so its use also had to overcome a lot of prejudice, White and his partner Erskine Hazard would found the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, creating the Lehigh Canal, and inspiring the exploitation of the anthracite deposits found by William Wurts around Carbondale, Pennsylvania which lead to the development of Scranton. The Mills of White and Hazard, and the regular large boatloads they proved they could supply had tipped the prejudice against Anthracite to wary neutrality in Philadelphia by 1822-1824 when the Lehigh was much damaged by flooding. The news of its rapid repair and restoration together with the fact anthracite stocks had for a time run down, but not out establishing the reliable sourcing finished off the bias, as did the beginning of mine output reaching the Delaware basin markets due to the long delayed completion of the Schuylkill Canal ...|$|E
