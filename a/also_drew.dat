50|$|As its usage has grown, {{the concept}} has <b>also</b> <b>drawn</b> criticism.|$|R
5|$|As {{agreements}} between the PNR and PȚ broke down (with the PNR awaiting for new developments), the PȚ joined Iorga's party, the Democratic Nationalists, {{in creating the}} Federation of National-Social Democracy (which <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> support from the group around Nicolae L. Lupu).|$|E
5|$|Famed American {{illustrator}} Norman Rockwell's {{works were}} {{closely associated with}} the Boy Scouts of America for much of the 20th century. Beginning in 1913, Rockwell began illustrating covers of Boys' Life, the magazine for BSA youth. He <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> the organization's annual calendar illustrations between 1925 and 1976.|$|E

5|$|Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker, and Tracie Thoms {{play key}} {{supporting}} roles. Wendy Finerman produced and David Frankel directed the film, which was distributed by 20th Century Fox. Streep's performance drew critical acclaim and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, {{as well as}} the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.

5|$|After the Festival, the Nimrod was showcased {{for three}} weeks in October at the Berlin Industrial Show, where it <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> crowds, {{including}} the West Germany economics minister Ludwig Erhard. Afterwards, however, as it had served its purpose the Nimrod was dismantled. As the Nimrod was not intended as an entertainment product, it was not followed up by any future games, and Ferranti continued its work on designing general purpose computers.|$|E

His college decision came down to Michigan and Michigan State in East Lansing. He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when coach Jud Heathcote {{told him he could}} play the point guard position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> him to the program.|$|E
5|$|Although the xx {{had been}} {{strongly}} influenced by R acts, the album <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> comparisons from critics to alternative rock, electronica, and post-punk sounds. The melancholic songs on xx featured minimalist arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed reverb in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.|$|E
5|$|Construction on Fort Snelling {{began in}} 1820 and was {{finished}} in 1825. The Fort became {{a magnet for}} settlement in east-central Minnesota. Nearby Mendota was established {{during the same period}} and, as the regional headquarters for the American Fur Company, <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> settlement in the area soon becoming Minnesota's commercial center. Many of the first stone buildings in the territory were constructed in Mendota by employees of the American Fur Company, which bought animal pelts at that location from 1825 to 1853.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{teachers}} were <b>also</b> <b>drawn</b> {{from among the}} major intellectuals of the time: ...|$|R

5|$|During its {{original}} 1989 theatrical release, Mermaid earned $84.4 {{million at the}} North American box office, falling just short of Katzenberg's expectations but earning 64% more than Oliver. The film was theatrically reissued on November 14, 1997, {{on the same day}} as Anastasia, a Don Bluth animated feature for Fox Animation Studios. The reissue brought $27.2 million in additional gross. The film <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> $99.8 million in box office earnings outside the United States and Canada between both releases, resulting in a total international box office figure of $211 million.|$|E
5|$|Fields' {{political}} enemies {{charged him with}} corruption and chastised him for issuing too many pardons. He <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E

5|$|In Chapter XVI, Poe recounts Captain James Cook's circumnavigation of {{the globe}} aboard the Resolution that reached 70°10' latitude. He <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> from A Narrative of Four Voyages (1832), an account by Benjamin Morrell that became a bestseller. A Narrative of Four Voyages may have given Poe {{the idea of the}} {{summarized}} title of his novel. Poe may have used these real-life accounts in an attempt to hoax his readers into believing the novel was an autobiographical narrative by Pym.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Irish influences, Bax <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the musicologist Julian Herbage as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that Winter Legends, composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.|$|E
5|$|It {{became the}} market centre {{for the area}} and <b>also</b> <b>drew</b> traders from further afield to its four annual fairs (now reduced to two). Cattle drovers {{bringing}} cattle, horses and sheep from Northumbria and Scotland regularly came to the town. The original cattle market was by the church, but sheep were sold on High Street until {{the early part of}} the 20th century. With the arrival of the railway the mart was built close to the station, but this later closed and today the cattle market is held in Applegarth Court.|$|E
