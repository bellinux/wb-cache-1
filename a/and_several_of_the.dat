5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{pendulum}} had swung back towards road transport. The Cromford Canal was largely abandoned in 1944, <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rail lines passing through the Peak were closed as uneconomic in the 1960s as part of the Beeching Axe.

5|$|Cambodian Rocks is a {{compilation}} of 22 uncredited, untitled Cambodian psychedelic and garage rock songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s.

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E

Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre the engines right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, <b>and</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engines toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
