5000|$|The U.S. {{government}} <b>authorized</b> refugee <b>admissions</b> on {{an ad hoc}} basis, designating specific populations {{for entry}} through [...] "erratic and unpredictable authorizations." [...] The approach toward federal funding of refugee resettlement was similarly ad hoc. Generally speaking, the resettlement agencies provided {{the vast majority of}} the resources needed to support refugee. The Displaced Persons Act of 1948, the first refugee legislation enacted by U.S. Congress, provided for the admission of an additional 400,000 displaced Europeans. Previous to this Act, 250,000 displaced Europeans had already been admitted to the U.S. After the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, refugee admission laws evolved to accept people fleeing from communist regimes such as Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia, North Korea, China, and Cuba. The refugees were usually supported by private (both ethnic, religious and secular) organizations, which formed the basis for the public/private role of U.S. refugee resettlement today. Notable resettlement efforts include the admission of 35,000 Hungarians who fled the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

40|$|Controversy {{continues}} unabated {{over the}} question left unresolved by DeFunis v. Odegaard: whether in its admissions process {{a state law}} school may accord preferential treatment to certain racial and ethnic minorities. In the pages of two journals published by the University of Chicago, Professors John Hart Ely and Richard Posner have established diametrically opposed positions in the debate. Their contributions are of special interest because each undertakes {{to answer the question}} within the framework of a theory concerning the proper distribution of authority between the judiciary and the other institutions of government. Neither position, in my judgment, adequately confronts the problem of the judicial role in a democracy. The value choices Posner would have the courts eschew are inescapable if the equal protection clause is to be employed as a measure of legislative power. Precisely because such choices are essential whenever the clause is used to limit legislative power, however, appropriate sensitivity to the values served by democratic decision-making requires courts to defer to legislative judgments unless they clearly transgress constitutional tradition. Nothing in American constitutional tradition requires courts to deny legislatures the power to <b>authorize</b> preferential <b>admissions</b> policies for racial and ethnic minorities. The validity of such policies depends only upon a judgment that they serve the public welfare. The arguments that can be advanced to support such a judgment are more than ample to sustain such an exercise of legislative power. The precise question posed by DeFunis and like cases, however, is not whether preferential admissions policies are within the competence of a legislature, but whether they are valid when adopted by a university without explicit legislative sanction. There is, I shall argue, a significant difference between these questions, and because of that difference existing racial preference programs draw no support from Ely 2 ̆ 7 s analysis. Although {{there is good reason to}} sustain preferential policies in any event, the grounds for such a judgment are far less compelling than they would be if the policies had received explicit legislative approval...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The United States {{has long}} {{distinguished}} temporary migration from settlement migration. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) establishes {{the circumstances under}} which foreign nationals may be admitted temporarily or come to live permanently Those admitted on a permanent basis are known as immigrants, or lawful permanent residents (LPRs), while those admitted on a temporary basis are known as nonimmigrants. The INA provides for the admission of nonimmigrants for designated periods of time and a variety of specific purposes. Nonimmigrants include tourists, foreign students, diplomats, temporary agricultural workers, cultural exchange visitors, internationally known entertainers, foreign media representatives, intracompany business personnel, and crew members on foreign vessels, among others. Policy discussions about nonimmigrant admissions are as varied as the visa classes under which temporary migrants enter. Tourists, business visitors, and foreign students, for example, are usually seen as a boon to the U. S. economy, while the economic costs and benefits of temporary workers are hotly debated. In addition, cultural exchange programs are a foreign policy tool, intended to foster democratic principles and spread American values across the globe, but some of these programs that include work authorization have come under scrutiny for an alleged lack of protections for both U. S. workers and program participants. Further, the entry of nonimmigrants has prompted national security concerns—particularly over those who enter under the Visa Waiver Program. Debates also continue over the implementation of a system to document the exits of foreign nationals from the United States, as nonimmigrants who remain in the country after their visas expire are accounting for a growing share of the unauthorized alien population. Achieving an optimal balance among policy priorities—ensuring national security, facilitating trade and commerce, supporting fair labor practices, protecting public health and safety, and fostering international cooperation—remains a challenge. As policymakers consider modifying nonimmigrant visa categories, they may be interested in learning more about each of the categories and their relationship to the policy priorities. This report explains the statutory and regulatory provisions that govern nonimmigrant admissions to the United States before turning to a description of the major nonimmigrant categories. It describes trends in temporary migration, including changes over time in the number of nonimmigrant visas issued and nonimmigrant admissions. Estimates of nonimmigrants who establish residence in the United States are briefly discussed, as are estimates of those who stay beyond their <b>authorized</b> period of <b>admission.</b> The report concludes with a detailed table showing key admissions requirements across all nonimmigrant visa types...|$|R
