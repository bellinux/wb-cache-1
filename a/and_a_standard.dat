5|$|From its beginning, {{the main}} {{features}} of the metric system were the standard set of interrelated base units <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> set of prefixes in powers of ten. These base units are used to derive larger and smaller units that could replace {{a huge number of}} other units of measure in existence. Although the system was first developed for commercial use, the development of coherent units of measure made it particularly suitable for science and engineering.|$|E

It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> exception handling model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E
