5|$|In 1803, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn {{appointed}} Scott and Governor James Garrard {{to evaluate}} sites in Kentucky {{on which to}} construct a replacement for Fort Washington. Garrard, a central Kentucky native, insisted that the fort should be built at Frankfort. Scott disagreed, contending that the fort {{should not be in}} the state's interior and that the hilly terrain around Frankfort was unsuitable for constructing a fort. He waited several days for <b>an</b> <b>appointment</b> <b>with</b> Garrard to try and reach an agreement, but when he was unable to secure one, he asked Dearborn for permission to act alone. Dearborn granted the request and accepted Scott's recommendation of a site in Newport, Kentucky. In 1804, Scott was again chosen a presidential elector with minimal opposition.|$|E

5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track.
