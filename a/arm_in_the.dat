5|$|On April 3, 2007, Holly lost to Snitsky. After the match, Snitsky wedged Holly's arm {{between the}} steel steps and {{repeatedly}} hit the steps with a steel chair, {{resulting in a}} broken <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storyline. Holly had surgery on April 16 because of a staph infection and missed around five months.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or another}} some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop units. From humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E

5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, the {{conductor}} {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, explaining her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she clutched at the railing, they muscled her away, breaking her <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for the conductor to kick her off the train.|$|E
5|$|The German {{pilots were}} {{increasingly}} lacking in quantity and quality. Galland recognised this {{but could not}} correct it without stepping outside his own authority. Galland noticed that the highly educated engineers and trainees were selected for the bomber <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early war years. Most of the brightest youth were pulled by expert campaigners, toward the Waffen SS and Kriegsmarine. The Luftwaffe did not match this effort.|$|E

Carter's difficulty in securing the assistance of Kennedy supporters during the election campaign contributed to his November defeat by Ronald Reagan.|$|E

5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia {{as part of the}} Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised <b>arm,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E

5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|The MCC were {{reluctant}} to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected. Hutton began the tour well, scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by Wisden as the best English innings of the tour. A string of other good performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world. However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs {{in the first three}} Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball duck, and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured <b>arm.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second innings of the latter game, he quickly scored 37, frequently driving the bowling of Miller and Fred Freer before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.|$|E
5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E
