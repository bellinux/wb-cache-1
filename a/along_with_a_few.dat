5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, {{ribs and}} parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor. There is currently disagreement over the age of the Kirtland Formation, with some workers claiming a late Campanian age, while others suggest a younger age in the early Maastrichtian stage.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle.

5|$|During this time, the U.S. Army {{underwent}} a drastic reduction in size.

Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 percent of its full-strength authorization. Only 10 percent of the division's officers and 5 percent of its enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.|$|E
5|$|Nagaraju and Malliswari of Veerapuram are {{maternal}} cousins {{who became}} close friends in childhood.

5|$|Payne's law {{practice}} {{continued to be}} successful through the early 1840s, but after suffering from attacks of hemoptysis (bleeding in the lungs), {{he was forced to}} curtail his activities. Instead, he devoted his time to business affairs and local politics. He began to promote the extension of railroads into Cleveland. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> associates, Payne founded the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad in 1851, and served as its president. He also invested in several other local railroads. He resigned the railroad presidency in 1854, but the following year became president of a different railroad, the Painesville and Ashtabula. That same year, Payne became one of Cleveland's first water works commissioners. He also invested in real estate, and in 1888 arranged for the construction of the Perry-Payne Building in the present-day Warehouse District.|$|E

5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1800, the Neapolitan government, reinstated in Naples after being expelled the year before, finally {{agreed to participate in}} the siege and 1,200 troops were embarked on a squadron led by Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's flagship HMS Queen Charlotte and landed on Malta. For a time, both Keith and Nelson remained with the blockade squadron, which consisted of six ships of the line, <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Neapolitan Ships of The Line, and several British and Neapolitan frigates. On 17 February a message arrived with the squadron from the frigate HMS Success, which had been stationed off Sicily to watch for French reinforcements. Captain Shuldham Peard reported that he was shadowing a squadron of six or seven French ships sailing in the direction of Malta. These vessels were a relief squadron, sent from Toulon with extensive food supplies and 3,000 additional troops under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée in Généreux, one of the ships of the line that had escaped at the Nile two years earlier. On 18 February, the convoy was sighted by lookouts on Alexander. In the ensuing chase, Success captured a French transport and attacked the much larger Généreux. Although the frigate was damaged in the exchange, Success second broadside mortally wounded Perrée and delayed the ship of the line long enough for HMS Foudroyant, under Lord Nelson, and HMS Northumberland to join the battle. Heavily outnumbered, Généreux surrendered.|$|E
5|$|In 788, Staurakios is {{recorded}} as attending {{as a judge}} in the bride show for the 17-year-old Constantine VI, along with Irene and the young Byzantine emperor himself. Maria of Amnia was chosen, although Constantine was unhappy about the breaking up of his earlier betrothal with Rotrude, Charlemagne's daughter. From this point on, he began to resent his mother's control over state affairs {{and the power of}} her eunuch officials. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> trusted conspirators, Constantine planned to arrest Staurakios and exile him to Sicily, while he would assume his position as effective co-ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Their plans were preempted by Staurakios, however: he persuaded Irene to arrest, torture, exile or imprison Constantine's associates, while Constantine himself was placed under house arrest. Next, Irene demanded of the army an oath of loyalty, whose wording placed her before her son in precedence. This demand provoked a mutiny by the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, which then spread throughout the Anatolian armies, which assembled in Bithynia and demanded Emperor Constantine's release. Bowing to their pressure, Irene capitulated and Constantine was installed as sole ruler in December 790. Among Constantine's first acts was to have Staurakios flogged, tonsured, and exiled to the Armeniac Theme, while all other eunuch officials were likewise exiled.|$|E

The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily Hominoidea of apes.|$|R
5|$|The first {{mention of}} John occurs in 1188 {{when he was}} {{teaching}} at Oxford. This record notes that he witnessed a legal case decided by delegated judges for the Bishop of Lincoln. <b>Along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John {{was among the first}} securely attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani {{and was one of the}} teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers. Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law, but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied somewhere on the Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not securely attested. By the late 1190s, John was a member of the household of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides Walter, another of his patrons was Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen.|$|E
5|$|Following his leaving, Mitsuda {{has only}} worked on one more {{original}} game with Square, composing for 1999's Chrono Cross, {{the sequel to}} Chrono Trigger. He has worked on over a dozen games since then, including the spiritual sequel to Xenogears, , and major titles such as Shadow Hearts and Luminous Arc. In addition to video games, Mitsuda has composed music for the anime Inazuma Eleven and for the independent album Kirite. On November 22, 2001, Mitsuda formed Procyon Studio as a company to produce his music, along with a record label, Sleigh Bells. The company consisted of only Mitsuda as composer <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> sound producers for several years, but has since expanded to include six employees. Mitsuda and Procyon Studio have also produced more arranged albums, such as Sailing to the World and 2009's Colours of Light, a compilation album of vocal pieces Mitsuda has composed. The studio was also involved in co-designing the KORG DS-10 synthesizer program for the Nintendo DS, and its successor for the Nintendo 3DS, KORG M01D. Mitsuda claims that, for the projects Procyon {{had been working on}} in the late 2000s, he was focusing more on working as a music producer for a team of artists rather than just as a composer. Despite that, Mitsuda continued to compose for several notable games in the 2010s, such as the Inazuma Eleven series, Soul Sacrifice, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Valkyria Revolution, with the latter marking his first fully solo game soundtrack in eight years. Around the same time, Mitsuda also began to compose for non-video game media, including several NHK-produced television shows, as well as anime series such as Black Butler and adaptions of Inazuma Eleven.|$|E
