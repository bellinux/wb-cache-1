5|$|The first widely {{distributed}} comic strip to tackle LGBT themes {{and include a}} gay character was Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury.

Two years later, the long-standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay, continuing a reputation for controversial content.

5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story {{on the front page}} of the Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won <b>a</b> <b>Pulitzer</b> Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off and went on to chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of <b>a</b> <b>Pulitzer</b> Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as {{thousands of people were}} trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, and a number of these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|The Teamsters Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters. Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, {{was by far the}} most dominant labor force on the pipeline project. There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won <b>a</b> <b>Pulitzer</b> Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|E
