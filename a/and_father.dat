40|$|Parenting a {{child with}} autism may {{differentially}} affect mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> Existing studies of mother–father differences often ignore the interdependence of data within families. We investigated gender differences within-families using multilevel linear modeling. Mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> of children with autism (161 couples) reported on their own well-being, and their child’s functioning. Mothers {{reported higher levels of}} distress compared with <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> child behavior problems predicted psychological distress for both mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> We found little evidence of child functioning variables affecting mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> differently. Gender differences in the impact of child autism on parents appear to be robust. More family systems research is required to fully understand these gender differences and the implications for family support...|$|R
40|$|Shared {{decision}} making between {{children and parents}} is required in orthodontics. This study compared agreement among mothers, <b>fathers,</b> <b>and</b> children regarding the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) of children. A sample of 71 child patients (41 girls and 30 boys) aged 12. 6 years with an orthodontic treatment need, together with both their parents completed components of the child OHRQoL measure. Agreement among children, mothers, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> {{was derived from the}} 31 analogous questions and assessed using comparison and correlation analyses. Comparison analyses identified significant differences between mother's and children's reports <b>and</b> between <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. The magnitude of the difference between mother's and children's reports, <b>and</b> between <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports could best be described as moderate (standard difference > 0. 2). In addition, absolute differences in scores constituted between 12 and 18 per cent of domain and overall scores for both mother's <b>and</b> children's, <b>and</b> <b>father's</b> <b>and</b> children's reports. Correlation analysis, at the individual family unit level, showed that agreement between mothers and children, <b>and</b> between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was fair [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) < 0. 04]. Neither mothers nor fathers know their child's oral health status very well, as there was significant disagreement between mothers', fathers', and children's perceptions. The disagreement between mothers <b>and</b> children, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> children was similar. While at the group level, mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> tended to agree on perception of their children's oral health status, at an individual family unit level they did not. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{components}} and the plurality of everyday parenting among separated mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b> Drawing on an online survey of 114 mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers,</b> {{it presents a}} topological analysis of mothers’ and fathers’ child-rearing activities and decision-making; unilateral, parallel and negotiated relationships; residence and contact; and legal orders. The findings revealed five mothering <b>and</b> <b>fathering</b> patterns: ‘unilateral’, ‘traditional residential’ and ‘interchangeable’ mothering; and ‘involved non-residential’ <b>and</b> ‘interchangeable’ <b>fathering.</b> They disclose the relational and gendered structures of motherhood and fatherhood practice and social representation that are shaping post-separation parenting within the legal framework of shared parenting. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

Similarly, Stevens' dissent found a strong interest in promoting adoption and that maternity created a significant difference in physical and psychological parenting between biological mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers.</b>|$|R

Specifically, most mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> belong to the resilience trajectory, characterized by a stable emotional wellbeing over time. A significant group of mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> show moderate, <b>and</b> yet relatively stable, depressive symptoms (distress trajectory).
