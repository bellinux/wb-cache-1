40|$|AbstractCurrently {{the most}} widely used {{replacement}} policy in the last cache is the LRU algorithm. Popular <b>as</b> it <b>is,</b> LRU <b>performs</b> <b>poorly</b> when it has a memory-intensive workload whose working set is larger than the available cache capacity. The algorithm evicts a line without taking into account its longer history of usage. The result is that some live lines may be replaced by some newly-referenced blocks, though {{it is possible that the}} new blocks will never be used again in the future. Hence, improving the replacement policy is critical to the improvement of cache efficiency and the overall system performance. In this paper we present a technique to retain the live line in the cache while evicting the dead line early by dividing the last level cache into two cooperative partitions (TCP), both of which use the LRU replacement policy. When a live line is evicted from one partition, it will be placed into the other partition. This new technique named TCP, as observed in our experiment, achieved an L 2 cache miss rate reduction of 9. 8 % on average with fifteen benchmarks from the SPEC CPU 2000 suite, and resulted in an IPC improvement of 2. 4 % on average...|$|R

30|$|After {{updating}} the weights, the algorithm also ‘shares’ {{some of the}} weight of each expert among other experts. Thus, an expert who <b>is</b> <b>performing</b> <b>poorly</b> and had its weight severely compromised can quickly regain influence in the master prediction once it starts predicting well again. The amount of sharing can be changed by using the α parameter, called the sharing rate. This allows the algorithm to adapt to ‘bursty’ behavior. Indeed, in Section 5, we use, among others, bursty traffic scenarios to evaluate the performance of our algorithm.|$|R
