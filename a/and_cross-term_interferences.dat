40|$|Abstract: Digital {{intercept}} receivers {{are currently}} moving towards classical time-frequency analysis techniques for analyzing low probability of intercept radar signals. Although these techniques are {{an improvement over}} existing Fourier-based techniques, they still suffer {{from a lack of}} readability, due to poor time-frequency localization <b>and</b> <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> which may lead to inaccurate detection and parameter extraction. In this study, the reassignment method, because of its ability to smooth out <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> <b>and</b> improve time-frequency localization, is proposed as an improved signal analysis technique to address these deficiencies. Simulations are presented that compare time-frequency representations of the classical time-frequency techniques with those of the reassignment method. Four different low probability of intercept waveforms are analyzed (two frequency modulated continuous wave waveforms and two frequency shift keying waveforms).

To detect both temporal and spectral changes in SSEP waveforms, an investigation of the application of time-frequency analysis (TFA) techniques was conducted. SSEP signals from 30 scoliosis patients were analysed using different techniques; short time Fourier transform (STFT), Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), Choi-Williams distribution (CWD), coneshaped distribution (CSD) and adaptive spectrogram (ADS). The time-frequency distributions (TFD) computed using these methods were assessed and compared with each other. WVD, ADS, CSD and CWD showed better resolution than STFT. Comparing normalised peak widths, CSD showed the sharpest peak width (0. 13 ± 0. 1) in the frequency dimension, and a mean peak width of 0. 70 ± 0. 12 in the time dimension. Both WVD <b>and</b> CWD produced <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> distorting the TFA distribution, but this was not seen with CSD and ADS. CSD appeared to give a lower mean peak power bias (10. 3 % ± 6. 2 %) than ADS (41. 8 % ± 19. 6 %). Application of the CSD algorithm showed both good resolution and accurate spectrograms, and is therefore recommended as the most appropriate TFA technique for the analysis of SSEP signals. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Wind turbine {{planetary}} gearboxes often run under nonstationary conditions due to volatile wind conditions, thus {{resulting in}} nonstationary vibration signals.

When the analysis emphasizes one component in a certain fraction domain, it will bring dispersion effect to some other components, so a compromise has to be made when determining the transform order.

A prescribed signal is expanded on its best basis and transformed into the Wigner domain. Subsequently, the interference terms are eliminated by adaptively thresholding the cross WD of interactive basis functions, according to their amplitudes and distance in an idealized time-frequency plane. We define a distance measure that weighs the Euclidean distance with the local distribution of the signal.

That is, the closer the two components, the lower the oscillation frequency. In ambiguity space, this would mean that the interference lies closer to the origin. The low frequency interference also appears as a result of the signal's instantaneous frequency changing nonlinearly with time. Due to the low frequency nature of these oscillations, the cross-terms may not be completely removed by the kernel due to overlap with signal components in the ambiguity space. Although this interference can be removed at the post-processing stage by (say) least-squares fitting to a Gaussian density, it is important to remember that this interference contributes to the signal's overall energy distribution.|$|R

40|$|Time-frequency {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} used to produce a plot of a signal’s power spectrum {{as a function of}} time. The most well-known time-frequency representation is the spectrogram. Although relatively simple to compute, it suffers from having a significant limitation in that it cannot offer good time or frequency resolution simultaneously. To overcome this weakness, many other representations have been developed that provide combined high resolution over time and frequency. The Wigner-Ville distribution, the scalogram, and the discrete Gabor transform are among the most well-known of these methods. Due to specific shortcomings with regard to these distributions for multi-component signals, and for certain mathematical concerns such as shift invariance and time and frequency marginal conditions, several classes of representations have been developed which effectively address specific signal types. Examples of these categories are Cohen’s class, the affine class, and the signal adaptive expansions based upon the Matching Pursuit method. The goals of any of these specific methods are to minimize <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference,</b> provide good time and frequency resolution, and provide a good model for the signal of interest...|$|R

However, the DFT is not suitable for the detection of transient PQDs [19, 20]. The STFT [21, 22] has the limitation of a fixed window, so it is also inadequate for the analysis of transient signals. WT overcomes the main drawback of STFT, but its capabilities are often significantly degraded under noisy conditions [7, 20]. The GWT [23] has disadvantages of <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> <b>and</b> heavy computational loads. Additionally, it must satisfy a synchronized sampling constraint [6]. The HHT leads to endpoint contamination during empirical mode decomposition, and is easily influenced by noise superimposed on signals [6, 24]. The ST [25] has the ability to detect disturbances under noisy conditions, but its computational demands are too high. Additionally, the Gaussian window function of the ST is inflexible. The KF [26] is the most popular parameter estimation method, but it cannot indicate the exact locations of transient PQDs. Furthermore, the KF trace has a delay in response to transient PQDs [6]. The STF [6], which is an enhancement of the KF, is also a parameter estimation method.|$|R

To {{solve the problem of}} <b>cross-term</b> <b>interference</b> existing in WVD there is an improved version of WVD, called Choi-Williams Distribution (CWD), which introduces the smoothing window as the kernel function and deals with the time-frequency analysis of heart sound signal.

ConclusionIn this paper, 21 cases of heart sound signals are acquired from the outpatients and hospitalized patients with coronary heart diseases. The research results of 21 cases show that the CWD method can be used to analyze heart sounds. It accurately identifies the 9 cases of heart sounds of health people and 12 cases of heart sounds of patients with coronary heart disease. Besides, the CWD displays obvious differences between heart sounds of healthy people and abnormal heart sounds. The contour line of heart sounds from healthy people shows the following characteristics: concise, columnar and non-divergence; while the contour line of abnormal heart sounds is divergent and has many columnar links.

There was no enhancement of low frequencies such as described in low frequency shadows from the Gulf of Mexico. This analysis was applied to other seismic lines acquired in areas where natural gas is produced from the Clinton interval and areas of possible natural gas attenuation were identified.

Many biological signals {{can be thought of}} as a sum of more elementary components each of which are relatively narrowband in nature. Common examples include speech which consist of a number of formant frequencies illustrating the resonance of the vocal tract.
