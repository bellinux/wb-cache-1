40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the {{literature}} on the determinants of financial development, the paper reviews the <b>Asian</b> and European <b>financial</b> systems in terms of their size and efficiency. It also compares the steps taken in the two regions in the quest for financial development and stability, which in a few cases are very similar but differ markedly in others. While there has been a clear move towards a more balanced financial structure in both regions, financial liberalization, as well as the strengthening of bank regulation and supervision occurred later in Asia and with a different speed and sequencing. The most striking difference between the two areas is the degree of international - and regional – financial integration, much lower for Asia. Finally, the case of Spain - as a European country with a finance-led convergence process - is analyzed in more detail. Lessons are drawn from the Spanish experience for <b>Asian</b> countries. <b>Financial</b> development, financial liberalization, Spanish financial system...|$|R

In 1999, nearly 5,000 workers were laid off from Fluor Daniel and 15 offices were closed.

In {{view of a}} 50% drop in airline passengers {{in the wake of}} the 1997 <b>Asian</b> <b>financial</b> crisis, forecasts were revised downwards. The final initial ridership estimate was 140,000 passengers per day. Actual initial ridership did not match these projections.

5|$|The 1997 <b>Asian</b> <b>Financial</b> Crisis {{affected}} the economy, {{resulting in a}} lingering decline {{of the value of}} the peso and falls in the stock market. The extent it was affected initially was not as severe as that of some of its Asian neighbors. This was largely due to the fiscal conservatism of the government, partly as a result of decades of monitoring and fiscal supervision from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in comparison to the massive spending of its neighbors on the rapid acceleration of economic growth. There have been signs of progress since. In 2004, the economy experienced 6.4% GDP growth and 7.1% in 2007, its fastest pace of growth in three decades. Average annual GDP growth per capita for the period 1966–2007 still stands at 1.45% in comparison to an average of 5.96% for the East Asia and the Pacific region as a whole.

5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and the nuclear power plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 <b>Asian</b> <b>financial</b> crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

This paper shows that, although the two proximate causes of this crises seem to be stronger inter-national competition and poorly developed domestic financial systems in Asia, the underlying causes were related more to the virtuous economic and financial cycles in Asia that turned into vicious cycles in 1997. The key determinant of Asian recovery is the reduction in the importance of these positive feedback cycles by reforming <b>Asian</b> domestic <b>financial</b> systems so they are no longer characterized by low disclosure levels, high debt ratios, and high political influence in credit decisions. ...|$|R
