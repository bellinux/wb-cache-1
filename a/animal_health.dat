5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and <b>animal</b> <b>health).</b> Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

30|$|The {{immune system}} is {{regularly}} affected by chemical periodic stresses. Adverse environmental situations may chronically stress the <b>animal’s</b> <b>health,</b> altering some of their immunobiochemical parameters and suppressing their immune and physiological responses (Miller et al., 2002). Pesticides are the major immunomodulators. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides is suspected of predisposing non-target species to diseases because of their immunobiochemical depressive effects (Dunier & Siwicki, 1993; Richard, Peden, & Williams, 1994).|$|R

50|$|The liver {{is another}} {{target for the}} mycotoxin. It {{is one of the}} first organs where the {{compound}} passes through after ingestion. Here it causes a reduced expression of CYP1A proteins in rabbits, pigs and rats. CYP3A activity decreases in pigs too. These enzymes help metabolize drugs that pass through the liver. Decrease in the activity could lead to an increase of unmetabolized drugs in the plasma. This can have a dangerous effect on an <b>animal's</b> <b>health.</b>|$|R
