5|$|Thomas Bonham {{had been}} {{admitted}} to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning {{for it to be}} allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some say at Fleet Prison, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> at Newgate Prison) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of habeas corpus, issued by the Court of Common Pleas, which freed him on 13 November.|$|E

25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, {{but it is an}} important part of the love and care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to find other ways of expressing their love for each other during these times, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, the {{formation}} talks became the longest in Belgian history. When the Parliament confirmed {{the formation}} of an interim Government, it had been 196 days since the Belgian people had voted out the previous coalition. It was the second longest formation period in European history, after the Dutch record of 208 days in 1977. Talks were interrupted twice by the resignation of the formateur, which left the political parties waiting for a new appointment by the King. Guy Verhofstadt was appointed as mediator on December 3, with the task not only of looking into {{the formation of}} a new government, but also of investigating how the government could handle certain urgent policy matters. Pressed by time, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> by the King, on 19 December, Verhofstadt concluded a deal on a Government and presented it to Parliament on 21 December; on the same day the Ministers took the oath of office.|$|E
25|$|Although the Talmud {{states that}} women are obligated to say birkat hamazon and that accordingly, three women can {{constitute}} a zimmun and lead it (Berachot 45b), later authorities, such as Maimonides and the Mishnah Berurah, held that women were exempt from leading a zimmun on grounds that women were not generally sufficiently educated to know how. A number of Modern Orthodox authorities have held that because of improvements in women's religious education women can now do so, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> {{that they are now}} obligated to. Accordingly, women forming a zimmun and leading birkat hamazon has become increasingly common in Modern Orthodox circles. Such authorities disagree, however, on the appropriateness of women leading a zimmun in the presence of men (or of three men). A minority of Modern Orthodox authorities, citing earlier authorities including Meiri, Sefer HaMeorot and the Shiltei HaGibborim, also hold that 10 women can (or should) constitute a minyan for purposes of saying Zimmun B'Shem for birkat hamazon. Unlike in Conservative or Reform Judaism, even Orthodox authorities who hold that women can form a zimmun maintain that one cannot be formed from a combination of men and women.|$|E

Jerusalem mamluk architecture (period 1250 AD to 1516 AD) include multi-colored mansonry in white, yellow, red and black.

25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In “The Raft Book,” a survival guide {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) and the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's Liberal {{party was}} elected, with a {{majority}} of the popular vote and a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly in the province's first election, the 1905 Alberta election. [...] The north-central constituency boundaries radiated out from Edmonton <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> this was a case of gerrymandered electoral boundaries. Rutherford emerged from the March 1909 election leading another formidable majority, that clearly reflected the broad popular support he and his government enjoyed. He would resign as premier 14 months later, in May 1910, after his government was implicated in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal.|$|E
500|$|Kala {{is named}} after M.I.A.'s mother, in {{contrast}} to her previous album, Arular, which was named after her father. She contends that Arular was a [...] "masculine" [...] album, but that Kala [...] "is about my mum and her struggle–how do you work, feed your children, nurture them {{and give them the}} power of information?" [...] She further summed the album up as [...] "shapes, colours, Africa, street, power, bitch, nu world, and brave." [...] According to Dominic Horner of The Independent, the album's music may not be appropriately described exclusively as either dance or world music, but it is a mixture of the two. Music critic Robert Christgau characterised its music as an [...] "eclectic world-underclass dance amalgam", and Jonathan Brown of the Irish Independent cited Kala as a proper introduction to [...] "world fusion", a genre that [...] "blends sounds from across the globe which wouldn't – <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>say</b> shouldn't – be put together." [...] By contrast, NPR's Oliver Wang argued that, rather than a [...] "so-called world music fusion" [...] attempt, Kala is [...] "agitated, propulsive pop" [...] informed by international sounds. Music journalist Jody Rosen called it [...] "an agitprop dance record" [...] that reappropriates hip hop in an international setting with beatbox riddims, [...] "playground" [...] rhymes, unconventional samples, and gunshot sounds.|$|E
