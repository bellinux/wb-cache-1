40|$|External photon beam {{therapy is}} a well {{established}} technique {{in the treatment of}} cancer. For the safe and effective use of this technique it is essential that the distribution of dose which would be produced by a given photon beam, or combination of photon beams, be known prior to irradiation. This thesis outlines a computer tomography (CT) number based system for calculating such dose distributions using the equivalent tissue-air ratio method. The system is composed of a number of programs which extract patient anatomical data from GE 8800 CT scanner <b>archival</b> <b>tapes,</b> calculate the dose distribution which would result from a given external beam, and display the calculated dose distribution using coloured digital images...|$|R

It currently holds approx. 700 documents totaling approx. 40, 000 page...|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Reno {{released}} his first solo album titled Renovation. The album {{is composed of}} ten tracks closely resembling {{the sound of his}} work with Loverboy though some discs contain a bonus track depending on the source. The album was apparently recorded in the early 1990s (reportedly 1992) and was supposed to be released by Sony but they chose instead to indefinitely shelve the project due to changes in the music industry... the changes touched on by Reno in his previously mentioned VH1 interview. Reno eventually proceeded to release the un-mastered recordings from his own <b>archival</b> <b>tapes</b> on his now defunct website but went on to release the album widely on a variety of sources. The main complaint amongst critics and fans is a lack of mastering, overall production and polishing commonly found on finished albums... but hard core fans and critics seem to feel the album is more than worthy of attention in spite of this.|$|R
5000|$|There were no {{magnetic}} disks, drums {{or other}} similar temporary backing-storage devices. Bulk storage {{was limited to}} magnetic tapes, on open reels, each reel of which was about one inch thick and nine inches (229 mm) across, holding a maximum of 2400 ft of tape. Data and programs were kept on these <b>tapes.</b> <b>Peripheral</b> error-checking was again limited to parity checks on all reads and writes {{and the use of}} write permit rings. The Kidsgrove KDF8 had eight magnetic tape units on-line, each rated at 40k characters per second read/write speed. Each tape unit was about 6 ft tall and 2 ft wide, and the processor and memory cabinets were about the same in size and number. The Kidsgrove configuration required a large air-conditioned room.|$|R

40|$|The Mark 3 {{correlator}} {{system is}} described in some detail. The correlator system {{is based on a}} modular philosophy. Each correlator module independently processes the data from one track pair. Therefore, 28 modules are necessary to complete a full one baseline processor and 84 modules for a full 3 baseline processor. Each correlator module has two interfaces: (1) data and clock from each of the two tracks to be correlated and (2) Computer Automated Measurement and Control (CAMAC) dataway interface to the computer. The processor is organized around the IEEE CAMAC standard architecture, housing 15 correlator modules in each of 6 crates. This allows one pass processing of a full 3 baseline 28 track observation or a 6 baseline (4 station) 14 track observation. The correlator architecture allows easy expansion for up to 8 stations. The computer system is an HP 1000 system utilizing a 16 bit minicomputer with disc and <b>tape</b> <b>peripherals.</b> The processing software is also organized in a modular fashion with many independent but cooperative programs controlling the operation of the Mark 3 processor. Processing time through the correlator is normally real time or faster, with graphics displays providing real time monitor and control of the processing operation...|$|R

5000|$|The Marconi Transistorized Automatic Computer was Marconi Company's first computer, {{designed}} and manufactured from around 1959. They employed Germanium transistors which {{by this time}} were sufficiently reliable with room temperatures kept below about 23 degrees C. Apart from transistor failure other common faults included Power Supply capacitors 'drying out' resulting in excess ripple and poor connections on the computer input output highway. Paper <b>tape</b> <b>peripherals</b> had their own poor reliability influenced by degree of operator usage. The type S3301 was a 500 kHz clocked 20 bit word machine with two Mullard core memory stores providing 4k of 20 bit data, see Ref. 4. The internal CPU logic was synchronised to even and odd clock signals and special signals generated via the microinstruction diode boards. The memory logic had slow and fast loops to speed the transfer of sequential data bursts. Its microinstructions were programmed on diode boards. A facility was provided to microstep through instructions to help with fault finding. Processor status bits were provided with machine instructions being decoded from 6 bits in the current address memory word. Double word data had the MSB designated a sign bit coded as binary fractions ( [...] -1 to +1) for the square root, multiply and divide instructions. The instruction set had the usual functions based on three registers named A, B and D (C was the current address in memory register, M). An additional instruction assisted with checksum calculation for data transferred to and from main data stores (viz. Sperry Rand magnetic drums.).|$|R

5000|$|Like the IBM 1401, the 1050 was {{commonly}} {{used as an}} off-line peripheral controller in many installations of both large [...] "scientific computers and large [...] "business computers". In these installations the big computer (e.g., a UNIVAC III) did all of its input-output on magnetic tapes and the 1050 was used to format input data from other peripherals (e.g., punched card readers) on the tapes and transfer output data from the <b>tapes</b> to other <b>peripherals</b> (e.g., punched card punches or the lineprinter).|$|R
5000|$|Rarely seen was the IBM 2321 Data Cell, a {{mechanically}} complex {{device that}} contained multiple magnetic strips to hold data; strips could be randomly accessed, placed upon a cylinder-shaped drum for read/write operations; {{then returned to}} an internal storage cartridge. The IBM Data Cell picker was among several IBM trademarked [...] "speedy" [...] mass online direct-access storage peripherals (reincarnated {{in recent years as}} [...] "virtual tape" [...] and automated <b>tape</b> librarian <b>peripherals).</b> The 2321 file had a capacity of 400 MB, at the time when the 2311 disk drive only had 7.2 MB. The IBM Data Cell was proposed to fill cost/capacity/speed gap between magnetic tapes—which had high capacity with relatively low cost per stored byte—and disks, which had higher expense per byte. Some installations also found the electromechanical operation less dependable and opted for less mechanical forms of direct-access storage.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{reported}} high prevalence of skin damage in neonatal units, {{little is known}} regarding assessment and management of neonatal skin. A questionnaire was designed addressing beliefs and practices of participants. This was distributed to neonatal nurses across southern England. In total 56 responses were returned (7 % response rate). Incidence of damage was perceived to be high, with 26 % of participants reporting that this occurred daily. Skin damage was frequently associated with medical devices, including nasal continuous positive airway pressure, medical <b>tape,</b> and <b>peripheral</b> cannulas. Staff education emerged as a key theme in promoting skin health. However, only 10 % of participants had received skin care training. Participants highlighted concerns {{about the lack of}} previous research in this area. The results confirm the vulnerability of neonatal skin to medical devices, with participants citing these as the primary cause of damage. Additionally, skin care is constrained by lack of training and resources...|$|R
