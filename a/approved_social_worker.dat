The findings show some variation in provision which is in itself indicative {{of a variety of}} factors operating to produce local and regional patterns of provision. Some of these are related directly to policy decisions, others to demographic and geographic variables, while still more are related to team structure, workload demands, and generic/specialist issues. The future pattern of mental health social work following the implementation of the NHS and Community Care Act is considered {{in the light of the}} findings from the survey. Under section 114 of the Mental Health Act, 1983, local authorities are required to appoint a sufficient number of <b>approved</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> (ASWs) to carry out the functions given to them by the Act. The Act enhanced the role of the ASW and stimulated many local authorities towards investing resources into the training and approval of ASWs. The goal of having ASWs as an integral part of a comprehensive mental health service, offering assessment, care and treatment, and discharging their statutory powers in an informed and responsible manner has been hard to achieve for some authorities. The task involves the determining of clear principles and policies to underpin and guide service delivery, familiarity with geographic and demographic data (particularly with regard to minority groups), the ability to calculate the resources needed to meet the requirements of section 114, and sufficient negotiation and liaison skills to work as part of a multidisciplinary team.

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} from a qualitative study concerning {{the influence of}} implicit models of mental disorder on shared decision making within community-based mental health teams. One-hundred participants representing five distinct multi-agency groups: psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses, <b>approved</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> patients and informal carers operating within Leicestershire, England were interviewed using a standard case vignette describing a person whose behaviour suggests he may have schizophrenia. The results showed {{that each of the}} study's multi-agency groups implicitly supports a complex range of model dimensions regarding the nature of schizophrenia, the appropriateness of specific forms of treatment and care, and their respective rights and obligations towards each other.

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} into home treatment for acute mental illness, {{but this is the}} first one to examine any association with Mental Health Act Assessments. It examines the question of whether there is any impact of a home treatment team on the numbers and circumstances of Mental Health Act Assess-ments in its area. The 1983 Mental Health Act created the role of the <b>Approved</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Worker,</b> among whose duties is that of ensuring that any disposal is the least restrictive possible. For this duty to be carried out meaningfully, as wide a range of alternatives as possible needs to be available. The move from institutional to community care for the mentally ill which has been the ’big idea ’ of recent decades has given rise to intense interest in home treatment for acute mental illness, which can offer a potential alternative at a time of crisis for ASWs and thus patients. This study examined over 200 reports written by ASWs following Mental Health Act Assessments in the two areas, and it was found that the home treatment team appeared to have an impact. it was hypothesised that such a team might have an effect on the sorts people presenting for assessment. It was conduded that area with the team had an absolute and a relative reduction in the numbers of assessments. It was also found that there was a decrease in the likelihood of detention under Section 3 of the Act for people living in the area of the team. Finally it was found that the involvement of the team in an assessment reduced the likelihood of a Section 3 decision even further.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the routine practice of <b>Approved</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Workers</b> (ASWs) in adult {{mental health services}} in Northern Ireland. It begins with {{a review of existing}} literature on the ASW role before describing how a retrospective audit, using a mixed methods approach, was used to collect data on eighty-four assessments carried out to determine whether compulsory admission to hospital was needed. Respondents were also asked to consider how such assessments might be affected by proposed changes to the law in this field. The key findings highlighted a number of areas of practice that may be improved. There were inconsistencies in how the assessments were recorded and an uneven distribution of workloads across ASWs. Some problems were identified with inter-agency working and, in a quarter of the assessments, the ASW reported having felt afraid or at risk. The authors make a number of recommendations, which include: the use of a standard reporting procedure; that organisations should consider how to deliver a more even distribution of ASW workload; that protocols should be developed that ensure that ASWs are not left alone in potentially risky situations; and that joint assessments with General Practitioners should be required, rather than just recommended...|$|R

40|$|Proposed {{changes to}} the Mental Health Act (MHA) {{legislation}} in England and Wales {{have been identified as}} having significant impact upon both mental health service delivery and professional roles. Key issues being identified for both service delivery and professionals are the creation of approved mental health professionals (AMHP), increased demand upon community services and a potential negative impact upon the therapeutic relationship.

40|$|In the UK, {{applications}} for involuntary admission to psychiatric units are made mainly by specially trained <b>approved</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> (ASWs). Proposed {{changes in the}} legislation will permit other professionals to undertake these statutory duties. This study aimed to examine how ASW status impacts upon work pattern and workload stresses by comparing ASWs with other mental health <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> who did not carry statutory responsibilities. A multimethod design was adopted that included a crosssectional national survey of mental health <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> (n = 237, including 162 ASWs), and a telephone survey of mental health service managers (n = 60). Data were collected using a semistructured questionnaire and diary, the content of which was derived from focus-group work and standard measures. Features of job content, working patterns and conditions were described and their association with stress, burnout and job satisfaction examined. ASWs were older and had been qualified longer than non-ASWs. The working patterns and conditions {{of the two groups}} did not differ, although ASWs did more hours on duty. ASWs received less support at work, particularly from supervisors and their role afforded less decision latitude than that of non-ASWs. ASW status was related to an elevated GHQ score, particularly among males. Emotional exhaustion was very high (over two-thirds in both groups) but ASWs and non-ASWs did not differ in this or any other feature of burnout, only 8 % of the sample were actually 'burntout', being more common among ASWs. ASWs were more dissatisfied and were more likely than non-ASWs to want to leave their job. Given that ASW status increased stress and job dissatisfaction, especially for men, and was related to a desire to leave one's current job, it seems likely that extending statutory duties to other professionals will increase levels of stress, burnout and dissatisfaction in these groups also. In turn, this might have consequences for staff recruitment and retention...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{national}} debate exists {{about the need}} for some form of compulsory supervision or treatment for mentally disordered individuals in the community and a recent Government review has proposed a new power of Supervised Discharge. Prior to this, a survey was undertaken in the London area of psychiatrists, community psychiatric nurses and <b>approved</b> <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> (ASWs). Their knowledge of, and attitudes towards, various forms of proposal were obtained. There were clear professional differences in willingness to use such powers, with psychiatrists the most enthusiastic. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' proposal was the best understood and most favoured by all three groups. Only ASWs considered extension of guardianship order a viable alternative and they placed it third. The commonest reservations expressed were that compulsory supervision would scare patients off or be used as a substitute for properly resourced services. Psychiatrists were asked to indicate the number and diagnoses of patients they considered suitable for compulsory supervision. Over 70 % of patients recommended suffered from schizophrenic disorders and 20 % from affective psychoses. Their number ranged from 0 - 15 per team with an average of 2. 38. The total adjusted figure for South West Thames was 195 patients, which would suggest just over three thousand patients in England and Wales. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted...|$|R

40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{everyday}} ethics of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> in {{the expectations of the}} clients. The theoretical part is based on the knowledge obtained from the literature and electronic resources, which write about current society, ethics, <b>social</b> work, <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> client of <b>social</b> services. quality of social work, economization, legislation, and stress in social work, supervision, role of the <b>social</b> <b>worker,</b> expectations by <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> relationship between a <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> and client etc. The goal of this work is to find out what are the expectations of the clients of social services in relation to <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> {{and at the same time}} to gain awareness about how <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> deal with these expectations on a daily basis. Set out the four research questions: Which ideas do clients have about the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> profession? What do most clients expect from a <b>social</b> <b>worker?</b> How do <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceive ethics in their work? How can stress affect the work of <b>social</b> <b>workers?</b> For obtaining the data qualitative research was chosen. Specifically the techniques were used semi-controlled interview with open and closed questions with active listening technique and participatory observation technique. Research probe consists of accidentally selected <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and clients of social services in the district of Pisek. For the purpose of research was addressed 22 <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> and 18 clients of social organizations and institutions. The data was analyzed using the methods of scoring. The empirical part will focus on the expectations of the clients of <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> [...] The results shows that the expectations of the clients are very diverse, according to the social services, which they require. For example the six clients expect that the <b>social</b> <b>worker</b> can advise them with the resolution of their situation. Clients of social services require a suitable job or increase <b>social</b> benefits by <b>workers</b> at the Office. Almost all users of residential services require space and time for the interview. The results also shows that the all <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> perceive ethics during their work. Stress in difficult situations was felt by 10 <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> interviewed, mostly in a troubled situations. In my opinion there is a need for more and better way of informing the public about the profession of a <b>social</b> <b>worker.</b> When the public will know what they can expect by <b>social</b> <b>workers,</b> then <b>social</b> <b>workers</b> may recieve a feedback.
