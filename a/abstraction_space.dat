40|$|The {{increase}} in computational power available in computers {{over the past}} decades allows researchers to run simulations with an increasing amount of grid points. While this improves {{the accuracy of the}} simulation results, it poses a challenge when visualizing these results. Traditional flow visualization techniques such as Line Integral Convolution (LIC) require {{a lot of time to}} generate the corresponding representation of the flow. Furthermore, visualizing these representations is also demanding. Therefore, other representations of fluid flow have been proposed, such as streamlines and flow topology representations. These methods reduce the amount of data which is visualized and thereby increase performance, but the resulting visualization might be more difficult to understand. In his thesis, I describe an <b>abstraction</b> <b>space</b> for fluid flow visualization. The goal of this <b>abstraction</b> <b>space</b> is to allow continuous transitions between different representations of the flow, where each representation corresponds to a level of structural abstraction. This <b>abstraction</b> <b>space</b> enables people to understand the relation between the different representations. Besides structural abstraction, I also employ techniques which enhance spatial perception for the different representations. I discus how to enable a continuous transition between different fluid flow representations and how this structural transition can be combined with the techniques to enhance spatial perception.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of Abstractocyte, a system for the visual analysis of astrocytes, and their relation to neurons, in nanoscale volumes of brain tissue. Astrocytes are glial cells, i. e., non-neuronal cells that support neurons and the nervous system. Even though glial cells make up around 50 percent of all cells in the mammalian brain, {{so far they have}} been far less studied than neurons. Nevertheless, the study of astrocytes has immense potential for understanding brain function. However, the complex and widely-branching structure of astrocytes requires high-resolution electron microscopy imaging and makes visualization and analysis challenging. Using Abstractocyte, biologists can explore the morphology of astrocytes at various visual abstraction levels, while simultaneously analyzing neighboring neurons and their connectivity. We define a novel, conceptual 2 D <b>abstraction</b> <b>space</b> for jointly visualizing astrocytes and neurons. Neuroscientists can choose a joint visualization as a specific point in that 2 D <b>abstraction</b> <b>space.</b> Dragging this point allows them to smoothly transition between different abstraction levels in an intuitive manner.

40|$|Computational {{scientists}} are frequently {{confronted with a}} choice: implement algorithms using high-level abstractions, such as matrices and mesh entities, for greater programming productivity or code them using low-level language constructs for greater execution efficiency. We have observed {{that the cost of}} implementing a representative unstructured mesh code with high-level abstractions is poor computational intensity [...] -the ratio of floating point operations to memory accesses. Related scientific applications frequently produce little ``science per cycle'' because their abstractions both introduce additional overhead and hinder compiler analysis and subsequent optimization. Our work exploits the semantics of abstractions, as employed in unstructured mesh codes, to overcome these limitations and to guide a series of manual, domain-specific optimizations that significantly improve computational intensity. We propose a framework for the automation of such high-level optimizations within the ROSE source-to-source compiler infrastructure. The specification of optimizations is left to domain experts and library writers who best understand the semantics of their applications and libraries and who are thus best poised to describe their optimization. Our source-to-source approach translates different constructs (e. g., C code written in a procedural style or C++ code written in an object-oriented style) to a procedural form in order to simplify the specification of optimizations. This is accomplished through raising operators, which are specified by a domain expert and are used to project a concrete application from an implementation space to an <b>abstraction</b> <b>space,</b> where optimizations are applied. The transformed code in the <b>abstraction</b> <b>space</b> is then reified as a concrete implementation via lowering operators, which are automatically inferred by inverting the raising operators. Applying optimizations within the <b>abstraction</b> <b>space,</b> rather than the implementation space, leads to greater optimization portability. We use this framework to automate two high-level optimizations. The first uses an inspector/executor approach to avoid costly and redundant traversals of a static mesh by memoizing the relatively few references required to perform the mathematical computations. During the executor phase, the stored entities are accessed directly without resort to the indirection inherent in the original traversal. The second optimization lowers an object-oriented mesh framework, which uses C++ objects to access the mesh and iterate over mesh entities, to a low-level implementation, which uses integer-based access and iteration.

40|$|Abstraction {{techniques}} {{are important for}} solving constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints and low solution density. In the presence of global constraints, backtracking search is unable to prune partial solutions. It therefore operates like pure generate-and-test.

This paper describes how <b>abstraction</b> <b>spaces</b> can be characterized in terms of approximate symmetries of the original, concrete search space. It defines two special types of approximate symmetry, called &quot;range symmetry &quot; and &quot;domain symmetry&quot;, which apply to function finding problems.

Testing alone is rarely able to flush out all bugs, and many lurk in difficult-to-test corner cases. An important alternative is static analysis, in which correctness properties of a program are checked without running it. While it cannot catch all errors, static analysis can catch many subtle problems that testing would miss. We propose a new space of abstractions for pointer analysis—an important component of static analysis for C and similar languages. We identify two main components of any abstraction—how to model statement order and how to model conditionals, then present {{a new model of}} programs that enables us to explore different abstractions in this space. Our assign-fetch graph represents reads and writes to memory instead of traditional points-to relations and leads to concise function summaries {{that can be used in}} any context.
