40|$|Modern {{microprocessors}} incorporate sophisticated {{techniques to}} allow early execution of loads without compromising program correctness. To do so, the structures {{that hold the}} memory instructions (Load and Store Queues) implement several complex mechanisms to dynamically resolve the memory-based dependences. Our main objective in {{this paper is to}} design an efficient LQ-SQ structure, which saves energy without sacrificing much performance. We propose a new design that divides the Load Queue into two structures, a conventional associative queue and a simpler FIFO queue that does not allow <b>associative</b> <b>searching.</b> A dependence predictor predicts whether a load instruction has a memory dependence on any inflight store instruction. If so, the load is sent to the conventional associative queue. Otherwise, it is sent to the non-associative queue which can only detect dependence in an inexact and conservative way. In addition, the load will not check the store queue at execution time. These measures combined save energy consumption. We explore different predictor designs and runtime policies. Our experiments indicate that such a design can reduce the energy consumption in the Load-Store Queue by 35 - 50 % with an insignificant performance penalty of about 1 %. When the energy cost of the increased execution time is factored in, the processor still makes net energy savings of about 3 - 4 %. ...|$|E

However, the method of organizing files in computers has not been changed too much for decades. Searching for a particular document or file from a gegabytes collection based on traditional tree structured file directories becomes never an easy task. This study presents a system where documents are no longer identified by their file names. Instead, a document is represented by its semantics in terms of descriptor and contents vector. The descriptor of a document consists of a set of attributes, such as date of creation, its type, its size, annotations, etc. The content vector of a document consists of a set of terms extracted from the document. Such semantic information provides the user with <b>associative</b> <b>searching</b> capability, that is, documents can be obtained by giving required properties. The representation of document semantics and document organization and key word-based indexing techniques are discussed. Furthermore, for the largely used XML data in Web representing and exchanging, some structure-based querying techniques are proposed in this study, i. e. structural indexes and path expression optimization principles.

40|$|When {{searching for}} {{concepts}} in memory-as in the verbal fluency task of naming {{all the animals}} one can think of-people appear to explore internal mental representations {{in much the same}} way that animals forage in physical space: searching locally within patches of information before transitioning globally between patches. However, the definition of the patches being searched in mental space is not well specified. Do we search by activating explicit predefined categories (e. g., pets) and recall items from within that category (categorical search), or do we activate and recall a connected sequence of individual items without using categorical information, with each item recalled leading to the retrieval of an associated item in a stream (<b>associative</b> <b>search),</b> or both? Using semantic representations in a <b>search</b> of <b>associative</b> memory framework and data from the animal fluency task, we tested competing hypotheses based on <b>associative</b> and categorical <b>search</b> models. <b>Associative,</b> but not categorical, patch transitions took longer to make than position-matched productions, suggesting that categorical transitions were not true transitions. There was also clear evidence of <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> even within categorical patch boundaries. Furthermore, most individuals' behavior was best explained by an <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> model without the addition of categorical information. Thus, our results support a search process that does not use categorical information, but for which patch boundaries shift with each recall and local search is well described by a random walk in semantic space, with switches to new regions of the semantic space when the current region is depleted. ...|$|R

40|$|Data Distribution Management (DDM) {{deals with}} two basic problems: how to {{distribute}} data generated at the application layer among underlying nodes in a distributed system {{and how to}} retrieve data back whenever it is necessary. This thesis explores DDM in two different network environments: peer-to-peer (P 2 P) overlay networks and cluster-based network environments. DDM in P 2 P overlay networks is considered a more complete concept of building and maintaining a P 2 P overlay architecture than a simple data fetching scheme, and {{is closely related to}} the more commonly known <b>associative</b> <b>searching</b> or queries. DDM in the cluster-based network environment is one of the important services provided by the simulation middle-ware to support real-time distributed interactive simulations. The only common feature shared by DDM in both environments is that they are all built to provide data indexing service. Because of these fundamental differences, we have designed and developed a novel distributed data structure, Hierarchically Distributed Tree (HD Tree), to support range queries in P 2 P overlay networks. All the relevant problems of a distributed data structure, including the scalability, self-organizing, fault-tolerance, and load balancing have been studied. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the HD Tree is able to give a complete view of system states when processing multi-dimensional range queries at different levels of selectivity and in various error-prone routing environments. On the other hand, a novel DDM scheme, Adaptive Grid-based DDM scheme, is proposed to improve the DDM performance in the cluster-based network environment. This new DDM scheme evaluates the input size of a simulation based on probability models. The optimum DDM performance is best approached by adapting the simulation running in a mode that is most appropriate {{to the size of the}} simulation...|$|E

40|$|The need {{to manage}} diverse {{information}} sources has triggered {{the rise of}} very loosely structured data models, known as “dataspace models. ” Such information management systems must allow querying in simple ways, mostly by a form of searching. Motivated by these developments, we propose a theory of search queries in a general model of dataspaces. In this model, a dataspace {{is a collection of}} data objects, where each data object is a collection of data items. Basic search queries are expressed using filters on data items, following the basic model of boolean search in information retrieval. We characterise semantically the class of queries that can be expressed by searching. We apply our theory to classical relational databases, where we connect search queries to the known class of fully generic queries, and to dataspaces where data items are formed by attribute–value pairs. We also extend our theory to a more powerful, <b>associative</b> form of <b>searching</b> where one can ask for objects that are similar to objects satisfying given <b>search</b> conditions. Such <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> queries are shown to correspond to a very limited kind of joins. Specifically, we show that the basic search language extended with <b>associative</b> <b>search</b> can define exactly the queries definable in a restricted fragment of the semijoin algebra working on an explicit relational representation of the dataspace. 1...|$|R
