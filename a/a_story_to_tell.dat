5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E

Due to the terms of the contract, Tex fires Susan and the singing trio, leaving only Deke in the show. Before he has to begin his new tour, Deke drives Susan to her family's farm. Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate. Back on the farm, Deke and Susan talk, where she tells him about being fired, after which they are about to kiss, when they are interrupted by her parents, who ask him to sing the song he promised.

500|$|Hordern was {{appearing}} {{in three to}} four films a year by 1953, a count that increased as the decade progressed. In 1956 he took a leading part in The Spanish Gardener for which he spent many months filming in southern Spain alongside Dirk Bogarde, Cyril Cusack, and Bernard Lee. The New York Times called Hordern's role of the strict and pompous Harrington Brande [...] "an unsympathetic assignment", but thought the actor did [...] "quite well" [...] in his portrayal. [...] By the mid-1950s Hordern's name was becoming one of reliability and good value; as a result, he was offered a clutch of roles. In 1956 he appeared as Demosthenes in Alexander the Great, and Commander Lindsay in The Night My Number Came Up. He appeared in two other films the following year; the medical drama No Time for Tears, and the thriller Windom's Way. The Second World War was a popular genre for filmmakers during the 1950s. Hordern said the conflict took up {{a large part of}} people's lives; [...] "whether it be one of love, loss, nostalgia or tragedy", everybody, according to the actor, had <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and could relate to the situations that were being depicted before them on screen. He found his earlier naval experience to be an asset when cast in many war films, including The Man Who Never Was, Pacific Destiny, The Baby and the Battleship, all in 1956, and I Was Monty's Double two years later.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aboriginal woman Karina Lester and Chief Executive Craig Wilkins of the Conservation Council of South Australia raised {{concerns}} that the submission process was unnecessarily complicated as written submissions were required to be signed by a Justice of the Peace. Lester and Wilkins argued {{that this would be}} particularly difficult for members of regional and remote communities. Lester also pointed out that the language of the Commission's presentations and issues papers made them difficult for aboriginal people to comprehend. Lester drew attention to her father, Yami Lester, who lost his sight after exposure to radioactive fallout from British nuclear weapons tests at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and 1960s. She told the ABC: [...] "My father (lives) 27 kilometres west form Marla Bore, (he) doesn't drive, wouldn't have a JP on hand, and would probably need to travel down to Coober Pedy... but he certainly has <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and certainly would love to have input into the Royal Commission."The Royal Commission responded by agreeing to accept oral submissions in addition to formal written submissions.|$|E
