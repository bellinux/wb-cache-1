The development of an infant's haptic senses and how {{it relates to the}} development of the other senses such as vision has been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.|$|E

50|$|The {{nervous system}} {{consists}} of a ventral nerve cord, with one ganglion in each segment, and an anterior nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. Smaller ganglia are also located in the lateral and dorsal portions of each segment, but do not form distinct cords.

5000|$|In {{order to}} open their wings, extant species of Forficulina use their cerci because their wings fold into a [...] "package" [...] due to {{internal}} elasticity. While Asiodiplatys speciousus had such a wing package, like other earwigs in the Archidermaptera suborder, they also had long segmented cerci, as mentioned above. This means that the unsegmented cerci of extant species of Forficulina is probably not an adaptation for wing folding. Instead, {{it is likely that}} the cerci of Asiodiplatys speciousus served a function similar to that of an insect's antennae: <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This album {{received}} many compliments from various media and sources. One reviewer noted that [...] "Three Stories showcases <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and feel, and a thorough {{comprehension of the}} original compositions." [...] Another reviewer asserted that [...] "Three Storiesis certainly jazz piano, but it's the kind that belongs in a recital hall… Djangirov gets {{to the heart of}} every song." [...] Also many has credited him not only with extraordinary talent for young musician, but also with the ability to cross the frontier between jazz and classical.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have good}} {{eyesight}} {{above and below}} the water, excellent hearing, and <b>a</b> good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in their environments by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family.|$|R
50|$|Going further {{would be}} adding every human sense: sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch. Several works {{have been done}} (or are undergoing) to try to {{simulate}} each one. For example, haptic technology attempts to emulate physical contact by taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> user's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user.|$|R
50|$|At the moment, in {{addition}} to traditional prototypes, the literature proposes new solutions, such as an experimental mixed prototype based on a configurable physical prototype that allow to achieve <b>a</b> complete <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> thanks to the physical mock-up, and a realistic visual experience, thanks to the superimposition of the virtual interface on the physical prototype with Augmented Reality techniques.|$|R
5000|$|The Melfan {{head has}} large, {{vertically}} lidded eyes, enormous mandibles, and pincers projecting {{forward from the}} place where ears would otherwise be. There are also two long, thin, fragile, flexible feelers growing {{from the sides of}} the mouth, which feel like soft, furry feathers to the touch. When angry they click their pincers together rapidly; a slow clicking indicates a desire for attention. Projecting from slits where the bony carapace and underside join are six thin, bony, tubular, multijointed limbs, all of which are capable of manipulation but lack <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> [...] They are immobilised if they get turned onto their backs.|$|E
5000|$|Henshaw {{is treated}} by Doctor Emil Hamilton, {{a friend of}} Superman's, until Lex takes over treatment, {{transferring}} Henshaw's consciousness into one of S.T.A.R. Labs' drones, which Hamilton describes as being basically robot Supermen. Once inside the robot body, Henshaw snaps, unable to stand living without <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> and attacks Luthor, blaming him for both turning him into a machine and (correctly) believing that Luthor caused the accident intentionally. (It is later revealed that Luthor wanted to bathe Superman in radiation so he could track his movements and location.) [...] Superman is forced to intervene and, after a brief though devastating battle, Superman is able to talk him down. He returns to S.T.A.R. Labs to continue treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Justin's {{upper body}} has 43 total {{controllable}} degrees of freedom, {{which is the}} number of independent factors that define the robot's configuration. It can not only pick things up from the ground, but can also reach items at a height of about 2 meters. The robot also has torque sensors (a device that measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis) in its joints that allow it to manipulate its arms and hands. [...] If Justin were to go to space, it could be controlled here on earth by someone wearing an exoskeleton, which is a combination of an arm and glove that has force feedback (<b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> through forces, vibrations, or motions to the user). With Justin's unique software, one can use basic programming tools like Matlab or Simulink for control. Similarly, if Justin were to be in a household environment, humans would be able to control it via an iPad.|$|E
5|$|Horses have <b>a</b> great <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> balance, due {{partly to}} their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> where the body and limbs are at all times. <b>A</b> horse's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|R

5000|$|Samantha [...] "Sam" [...] Destine - An {{artist who}} {{has the power to}} {{generate}} and shape a metallic ectoplasmic armor and weapons around her. The design of the armor is an unconscious expression of her artistic mind, as it reacts to her thoughts. The shape and hardness of her metal forms are varied, as she can also generate a set of wings like a hang glider. The armor's beauty and strength can make flesh seem repulsive to her, and as a result, she has grown apart from ordinary people. The armor acts as a second skin, with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> similar to her own flesh. She is the youngest of the known Destine adults. She was born in the early 1950s, and was about the twins' current age in 1963. She graduated from college in 1972, and as part of the Relative Stranger Protocol, goes by the name Samantha Hassard of Perpignan, France. Alan Davis, who describes her as [...] "aloof, brooding and exotic", explained that he originally designed the character, nicknamed Argent, in 1991 for a series that he and Paul Neary tried to develop. Davis made her armor constantly changing, in order to alleviate the tedium of drawing its detail with accurate continuity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theme and}} {{title of the}} piece came from Jean Baudrillard's essay [...] "The Ecstasy of Communication" [...] that talks about the notion of [...] "home". To {{describe}} his installation Sermon looked at another one of Baudrillard's essays, and found {{the starting point of}} Telematic Dreaming. The installation existed within the digital telephone network of the ISDN. Two separate interfaces were created and put into two separate locations, were they function as customized video conference systems. In the two locations two double beds are placed, one in an illuminated space and one in a dark space. The bed that is in the illuminated space, has a camera directly placed above and records person A and the bed which is then sent as an image, to a projector that is directly placed above the second bed in the dark location. The live image is projected down onto the bed with Person B also in the image. Another camera located {{at the side of the}} projector screen, this camera sends a live image of the projection of Person A along with person B who is also in the image, to a variety of monitors that are located in the illuminated area and around the bed. This image that is created is called a [...] "telepresent" [...] image, what is presented on the monitor is a mirror, which reflects a person within another person's reflection. Sermons installation plays with ambiguous connotations, which represent a telepresent projection surface that appears on a bed. In the complete ISDN installation, psychological complexity is derived from the main object (the bed) and is then dissolved into the technology and geographical distance that is involved in the making of the installation. He wanted the user to feel the sense of existing outside of their own space, whilst around them <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> is created that is very real and this is enhanced with the use of the bed and the senses beginning to shift in the Telematic space. The user is within a Telematic body and within this body it is controlled by a voyeurism of itself. When the body is caused to interact in the installation, the effects of this determines the time and space of the body and this can be extended through the ISDN network the body can then travel at the speed of light. Within Telematic Dreaming the user can exchange their tactical senses and swap their sense of touch, with the sense of sight by replacing their hands with their eyes.|$|E
