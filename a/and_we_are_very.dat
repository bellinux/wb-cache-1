Jana Bennett, the BBC's then director of production, later apologised for the episodes, stating on BBC1's news bulletin: [...] "It is clear {{that a significant number}} of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of EastEnders, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence."

[...] I remain an ally to it and its makers, present and future, and fully support a smooth transition to a new director".

40|$|According to many {{participants}} at the 1974 Allerton Park Institute, perhaps the most memorable part of the conference was a seven-hour session simulating labor-management contract negotiations.

Of all the activities in collective bargaining, the actual bargaining session lends itself best to simulation activity, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> pleased to <b>be</b> able to locate an existing project which could be adapted for use at the Institute. This project was an industrial contract negotiation simulation developed by the Division of Public Employee Labor Relations, Labor Management Services Administration, U. S. Department of Labor (U. S.

30|$|The {{new concept}} of {{citizenship}} {{is based on}} a concept of freedom which marks the New Liberalism. A positive freedom linked to the idea of self-realization, to the actualization and development of one's possible self. A freedom which consists of motivated actions, that is to say those actions which involve the transformation of impulses to serve those ends and purposes with which one has identified oneself. An idea of freedom as being the ability and power {{to make the best of}} one's self and as such being part of divine disclosure in the human personp. An idea of freedom as social and overall moral emancipation, Green writes: “We who were reformers from the beginning always said that the enfranchisement of the people was an end in itself. <b>We</b> said, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>very</b> much derided for saying so, that only citizenship makes the moral man; that only citizenship gives that self respect which is the true basis of respect for others, and without which there is no lasting social order or real morality.
