40|$|Although {{the three}} {{standards}} have similar agglutinating activities, {{it was found}} that the first International Standard had about half the complement-fixing activity of the second International Standard and the EEC standard. The complement-fixing activities of the latter two standards were similar. On the basis of these results, showing that the agglutination and complement-fixation tests measure different biological activities in <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> sera, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization in 1976 assigned separate unitages of agglutinating and complement-fixing activity to the second International Standard for <b>Anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> Serum...|$|E

40|$|In {{field trials}} on the {{eradication}} of brucellosis from dairy herds in Great Britain, which began in 1933, a serum standard of reference {{was used for the}} examination of agglutinating suspensions prepared in different laboratories. In 1937, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) adopted this standard and made recommendations for its use internationally. These recommendations were revised by OIE in 1948, by the Third Inter-American Congress on Brucellosis and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Panel on Brucellosis in 1950, and again by the latter body in 1952.

40|$|We tested 413 {{water buffalo}} cows (142 cases and 271 controls) for the {{presence}} of <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> antibodies (by the skin test, the agglutination test, and the complement fixation test) and the Nramp 1 genotype (by capillary electrophoresis). Four alleles (Nramp 1 A, -B, -C, and -D) were detected in the 3 ′ untranslated region of the Nramp 1 gene. The BB genotype was represented among only controls, providing evidence that this genotype confers resistance to Brucella abortus. The monocytes from the BB (resistant) subjects displayed a higher basal level of Nramp 1 mRNA and a lower number of viable intracellular bacteria than did the monocytes from AA (susceptible) subjects. The higher basal level of the antibacterial protein Nramp 1 most probably provides the BB animals with the possibility of controlling bacteria immediately after their entry inside the cell...|$|E
40|$|The <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> agglutinins of the γG-globulin {{class in}} a bovine immune serum chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex were eluted into two {{fractions}} with differing mean electrophoretic mobilities. Although the slower agglutinins were readily transmitted across the gut of young rats fed with these proteins they were detectable in the circulation only as incomplete antibodies; the faster γG-agglutinins were barely transmitted. The transmission characteristics in young rodents of electrophoretic sub-fractions of normal bovine γG-globulin separated by chromatography from a commercial γ-globulin preparation were also studied. This preparation comprised two molecular species of γG-globulins (γ 1 and γ 2) with distinct mobilities, antigenicities and transmission characteristics. Their mobilities and transmission characteristics were not related. Retrospectively, the slow anti-B. abortus agglutinins which were readily transmitted in young rats were probably γ 2 -globulins, and the fast agglutinins which were barely transmitted were γ 1 -globulins...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{obtained}} {{which suggests that}} maternal γ-globulin (γG) is readily transferred to the foetal circulation of the grey squirrel. This was shown in two animals by the transfer of human γ-globulin and in a third by transfer of <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> antibodies. Foetuses of all five pregnant squirrels studied, showed on analysis of their sera by immunoelectrophoresis a line indicative of γG but not of γM. Transfer of γG to exocoelomic, amniotic and yolk sac fluids, also occurred, but analysis of these fluids by immuno and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a paucity of the high molecular weight α- and γ-macroglobulins, and lipoprotein. A pre-albumin component was present in relatively high proportion in all sera and fluids analysed and foetal sera were particularly rich in α-foetoprotein.

40|$|Brucellosis {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the most widespread zoonoses worldwide. Human brucellosis is a multisystem disease that may present with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, but it may also be asymptomatic with only serological evidence of infection. In this paper, a case report is presented of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) developing after a diagnosis of acute brucellosis in a young slaughterhouse worker. A 26 -year-old man was diagnosed with DVT which had presented with the complaints of weakness and fever and a one-week history of pain and swelling in the right leg. Ultrasound revealed that the right femoral and popliteal veins were occluded with thrombi. Brucella was diagnosed using Rose-Bengal, tube agglutination, the Brucellacapt test and an enzyme-linked immunoassay using <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> IgM/G antibody detection at another institution. Although rare, some infectious agents may cause vascular pathologies. These conditions may be life-threatening. Thus, it should be kept in mind that vascular complications may occur during infectious disease and patients should be monitored. Additionally, patients presenting with symptoms of DVT or similar vascular pathologies should be assessed for infectious agents, particularly Brucella and Salmonella, as well as other risk factors...|$|E
40|$|A double {{immunodiffusion}} {{test for}} precipitins against Brucella antigen A 2 {{was developed and}} applied {{to a variety of}} samples. The A 2 precipitins were produced by a heifer infected with B. abortus strain 2308, cattle vaccinated with killed B. melitensis strain H 38 or live B. abortus strain 19 and by a dog infected with B. canis. Precipitins were also detected in the second International Standard for <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> serum, in several anti-B. canis sera and at low levels in one anti-B. ovis serum tested. Antisera produced in calves against Yersinia enterocolitica serotype 0 : 9 had no anti-A 2 activity despite titers {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 1024 and greater than or equal to 1 / 80 in standard Brucella agglutination and CF tests, respectively. The test for A 2 precipitins lacked specificity as weak reactions were obtained with five of 295 sera from brucellosis-free herds. This test was relatively insensitive, detecting precipitins in only 16 of 24 sera from infected cattle and 27 of 54 sera positive by complement fixation and enzyme labelled antiglobulin tests performed with whole cell and smooth lipopolysaccharide antigens, respectively. The A 2 precipitins were detected in nine sera from five cattle, in two infected herds, which were negative by agglutination and complement fixation tests...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConsumption of {{milk and}} dairy {{products}} has increased significantly in Senegal in the last decade, and {{a large part of}} the local production comes from small processing units spread all over the country. We collected 85 bulk-tank milk samples from 68 smallholder dairy farms throughout the territory. Microbiological quality of milk samples was analyzed according to the official standards. Further, raw milk and pasteurized milk were screened for Mycobacterium bovis, Coxiella burnetii, and <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> antibodies. Ninety-three percent of pasteurized milk samples, 92 % of raw milk samples, and 81 % of sour milk samples failed to meet official standards. Pathogens detected in milk were C. burnetii (6 / 41, 15 %), which seems to be endemic in Senegal, coagulase-positive staphylococci (18 / 70, 26 %), and Salmonella Johannesburg in one sample. Further analysis of coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from samples containing more than 10 (4) colony-forming units per gram showed the presence of enterotoxigenic strains in 9 of the 10 samples. These results confirm the poor microbiological quality of milk produced by small units in Senegal, especially and surprisingly of pasteurized milk. This highlights the need to implement good hygiene practices, particularly in the postpasteurization process, and an effective monitoring throughout the production and delivery chain...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se {{investigar}} a freqüência de aglutininas <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> em caprinos e ovinos do Sertão do Estado de Pernambuco, Brasil. Foram processadas 700 amostras de soros sangüíneos, das quais 340 eram da espécie caprina (115 machos e 225 fêmeas) e 360 (136 machos e 224 fêmeas) ovina. Empregou-se a técnica do antígeno acidificado tamponado (AAT) corado com rosa bengala (RB). Das 340 amostras de caprinos avaliadas, duas (0, 6 %) foram reagentes ao AAT. Não se observaram associações significativas para as variáveis faixa etária (p= 0, 430), raça (p= 0, 936) e sexo (p= 0, 562). Das 360 amostras de ovinos, nove (2, 5 %) foram reagentes. Também não houve associação significativa entre as variáveis analisadas e a soropositividade para brucelose: faixa etária (p= 0, 522); raça (p= 0, 576) e sexo (p= 0, 461). Verificou-se associação significativa (p= 0, 042) entre as espécies estudadas e soropositividade para brucelose nos animais investigados. A soropositividade para Brucella abortus em caprinos e ovinos foi descrita pela primeira vez no Sertão de Pernambuco, fato que pode dificultar o sucesso do Programa Nacional de Controle e Erradicação da Brucelose, tendo em vista que nessa região é comum a criação consorciada de pequenos ruminantes com bovinos, além de representar riscos à Saúde Pública. PALAVRAS-CHAVES: Brucelose, ovinos, caprinos, pequenos ruminantes, sorodiagnóstico. The {{objective was}} to investigate the frequency of <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> agglutinins in goats and sheep of the backlands of the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. 700 samples of sanguine serums were processed, of which 340 were of the goat (115 males and 225 females) and 360 (136 males and 224 females) sheep. The technique of the Tamponed Acidified Antigen (AAT) dyed with Bengalese Rose (BR) was used. Of the 340 samples of goat evaluated two (0. 6 %) were reactive to AAT. Significant associations were not observed for the variable age group (p = 0. 430); race (p = 0. 936) and sex (p = 0. 562). Of the 360 sheep samples, nine (2. 5 %) were reactive. There also was no significant association between the analyzed variables and the seropositiveness for brucellosis: age group (p = 0. 522); race (p = 0. 576) and sex (p = 0. 461). Significant association was observed (p = 0. 042) among the studied species and seropositiveness for brucellosis in the investigated animals. The seropositiveness for Brucella abortus in goats and sheep was traced {{for the first time in}} the “Sertão” (dry interior region, backlands) of Pernambuco, fact that can hinder the success of the National Program of Control and Erradication of Brucellosis, due to the fact that it is common to raise small ruminants with bovines in this area, besides representing risks to Public Health.  KEY WORDS: Brucellosis, ovines, caprines, small ruminants, serodiagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Brucellosis is {{a costly}} disease of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Latent infections and {{prolonged}} incubation of the pathogen limit {{the efficacy of}} programs based on the eradication of infected animals. We exploited genetic selection for disease resistance as an approach to the control of water buffalo brucellosis. We tested 231 water buffalo cows {{for the presence of}} <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> antibodies (by the agglutination and complement fixation tests) and the Nramp 1 genotype (by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). When the 231 animals (58 cases and 173 controls) were divided into infected (seropositive) and noninfected (seronegative) groups and the Nramp 1 genotypes were compared, the seropositive subjects were 52 out of 167 (31 %) in the Nramp 1 A(+) (Nramp 1 AA or Nramp 1 AB) group and 6 out of 64 (9. 4 %) in the Nramp 1 A(-) (Nramp 1 BB) group (odds ratio, 4. 37; 95 % confidence limits, 1. 87 to 10. 19; chi(2), 11. 65 for 1 degree of freedom). Monocytes from Nramp 1 BB subjects displayed significantly (P < 0. 01) higher levels of Nramp 1 mRNA than Nramp 1 AA subjects and also a significantly (P < 0. 01) higher ability in controlling the intracellular replication of several Brucella species in vitro. Thus, selection for the Nramp 1 BB genotype can become a valuable tool for the control of water buffalo brucellosis in the areas where the disease is endemic...|$|E
40|$|Goat {{and sheep}} {{production}} in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil has shown great economic potential. However, health problems can compromise the productivity of these animals. Given the scarcity of studies about the occurrence of these diseases, {{the aim of the}} present study was to analyze the serological diagnosis of anti-Brucella and anti-lentivirus antibodies among small ruminants in municipalities located in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Pernambuco. The samples were collected from local slaughterhouses and dairy farms. In total, 997 serum samples from animals in slaughterhouses and dairy herds were collected. In order to diagnose the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), the samples underwent agarose gel immunodiffusion (AGID) testing. The buffered acidified antigen test (goats) and agarose gel immunodiffusion test (sheep) were used to detect <b>anti-Brucella</b> <b>abortus</b> and B. ovis antibodies following the methodology recommended by the Institute of Technology of Paraná (TECPAR). With anti-CAEV antibodies, seropositivity rates of 4. 1 % and 2. 2 % were recorded for animals from the slaughterhouses and dairy farms, respectively. None of the animals (goats or sheep) were positive for anti-B. abortus antibodies. With B. ovis, a seropositivity rate of 6. 5 % (n = 13) was recorded among the 199 sheep serum samples. Results of the present study confirmed the presence of the CAE virus in the meat and dairy herds studied, although the prevalence was low. Natural infection by B. abortus did not occur in the goat and sheep herds assessed. Seropositivity for B. ovis was confirmed, although prevalence was low. Direct tests are required to diagnose ovine brucellosis...|$|E
