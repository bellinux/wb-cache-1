5|$|Experimental {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> transport via thermal and heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness. This involves the insertion of small needles into the nerves supplying several muscles, administering small electrical impulses through these needles, <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> the electrical response of the muscle in question. Two EMG investigations can be characteristic in LEMS: compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) and single-fiber examination.|$|E
5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

The 1835 Act formally described the office and duties of Inspectors of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> <b>and</b> required every borough to appoint such officers and the 1866 Act passed responsibility for weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> to the Board of Trade. In 1900 the Board of Trade established the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) to provide laboratory facilities for weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|R

The second, the International Committee for Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CIPM), was an advisory committee of metrologists of high standing.

The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of fragments of pulverized rock, minerals and volcanic glass, created during volcanic eruptions <b>and</b> <b>measuring</b> less than 2mm (0.079inches) in diameter. The term volcanic ash is also often loosely {{used to refer}} to all explosive eruption products (correctly referred to as tephra), including particles larger than 2mm. Volcanic ash is formed during explosive volcanic eruptions when dissolved gases in magma expand and escape violently into the atmosphere. The force of the escaping gas shatters the magma and propels it into the atmosphere where it solidifies into fragments of volcanic rock and glass. Ash is also produced when magma comes into contact with water during phreatomagmatic eruptions, causing the water to explosively flash to steam leading to shattering of magma. Once in the air, ash is transported by wind up to thousands of kilometers away.|$|E

40|$|The {{education}} of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> at the Delft School of Engineering (1843 - 1963)   The Kingdom of the United Netherlands {{was the first}} state in the world which introduced the Metric System in 1820 through the 1816 Act of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b> At first education for the weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors was not available. After King William II founded the Royal Academy engineering school in Delft in 1842, the school's first director, Antoine Lipkens, who {{took an interest in}} weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> himself, seized the opportunity to establish a course for inspectors of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> in his school. In this two-year course students were trained to become the highest officials in the national Service of Weights <b>and</b> <b>Measures.</b> The programme was of high quality and continuously adapted to the current state of technology and to the various weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> Acts. The weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> inspectors were qualified and all-round experts. Nevertheless, after the Second World War their work became so complex that specialists from different fields in technical colleges and universities took over their tasks. The occupation of inspector of weights <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> became redundant. Attempts to create a university level education for the inspectors failed. In 1963 the Delft engineering school closed the doors to this programme, which was the end of a unique type of education for a unique occupation. 79...|$|R
