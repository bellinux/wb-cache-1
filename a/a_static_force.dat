50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of piezoelectric sensors {{is that they}} cannot be used for truly static measurements. <b>A</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> results in a fixed amount of charge on the piezoelectric material. In conventional readout electronics, imperfect insulating materials and reduction in internal sensor resistance causes a constant loss of electrons and yields a decreasing signal. Elevated temperatures cause an additional drop in internal resistance and sensitivity. The main effect on the piezoelectric effect is that with increasing pressure loads and temperature, the sensitivity reduces due to twin formation. While quartz sensors must be cooled during measurements at temperatures above 300 °C, special types of crystals like GaPO4 gallium phosphate show no twin formation up to the melting point of the material itself.|$|E
5000|$|Electromagnetic torque, {{which can}} be {{calculated}} as the average value of the Maxwell stress tensor along the airgap, is one consequence of electromagnetic forces in electric machines. As <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force,</b> it does not create vibrations nor acoustic noise. However torque ripple (also called cogging torque for permanent magnet synchronous machines in open circuit), which represents the harmonic variations of electromagnetic torque, is a dynamic force creating torsional vibrations of both rotor and stator. The torsional deflection of a simple cylinder cannot radiate efficiently acoustic noise, but with particular boundary conditions the stator can radiate acoustic noise under torque ripple excitation [...] Structure-borne noise can also be generated by torque ripple when rotor shaft line vibrations propagate to the frame [...]|$|E
50|$|As of 2008, {{wind power}} {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} power sources in the world. The bulk of this growth has been in the form of conventional, three-bladed, horizontal-axis wind turbines, with vertical axis wind turbines accounting for a small remainder. Converting the kinetic energy of the wind into useful electricity requires converting the linear horizontal motion of wind into the rotational motion of a shaft in an electrical generator. In every case this requires some method of maintaining <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> against the motion of the wind, to keep the wind-collection apparatus from simply blowing away. Conventional wind turbines accomplish this by mounting rotors rigidly on towers, relatively close to the ground. This arrangement works reliably, but is relatively expensive, requires large amounts of structural material, and cannot tap the much stronger winds often present at higher altitudes.|$|E

40|$|This study {{suggests}} a novel method for structural vibration-based health monitoring for beams which only utilises the first natural {{frequency of the}} beam in order to detect and localise a defect. The method {{is based on the}} application of <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> in different positions along the beam. It is shown that the application of <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> on a damaged beam induces stresses at the defect which in turn cause changes in the structural natural frequencies. A very simple procedure for damage detection is suggested which uses <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> applied in just one point, {{in the middle of the}} beam. Localisation is made using two additional application points of the static force. Damage is modelled as a small notch through the whole width of the beam. The method is demonstrated and validated numerically, using a finite element model of the beam, and experimentally for a simply supported beam. Our results show that the frequency variation with the change of the force application point can be used to detect and in the same time localize very precisely even a very small defect. The method can be extended for health monitoring of other more complicated structures...|$|E
40|$|This study {{suggests}} a novel non-model-based method for structural vibration-based health monitoring for composite laminated beams which utilises {{only the first}} natural frequency of the beam in order to detect and localise delamination. The method {{is based on the}} application of <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> in different positions along the beam. It is shown that the application of <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> on a damaged beam induces forces that push the delaminated layers together resulting in an increase of stiffness to a maximum when the static force is applied on the top and the middle of the delamination area. This stiffness increase in turn causes changes in the structural natural frequencies. The method does not require the frequency of the beam in its baseline condition. A very simple procedure for damage detection is suggested which uses <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> applied at only three points along the beam to detect and localise delamination. The method is numerically validated for a simply supported beam, using a finite element model of the beam.

30|$|This study proposes new wire {{mechanism}} called “the redundant drive wire mechanism” (RDWM), {{driven by}} double actuator modules. The RDWM is configured with velocity constraint modules (VCMs) that provide high-acceleration global and fine local motions.

40|$|Lameness is a {{major reason}} for culling sows from the {{commercial}} breeding herds. Stalder reported that sows culled for feet, leg, and locomotion disorders ranged between 6 to 15 %. In the U. S., commercial sow farms evaluate lameness using subjective methods. An objective and standardize method for assigning lameness scores to a sow would likely be more accurate than subjective scoring measures and provide producers with a useful tool to assess lameness. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} design and build <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> plate to measure weight distribution on four legs of a standing sow. Faculty and students in Animal Science, Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering, and Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine developed <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> plate system with automated characteristics to objectively detect lameness in sows. The static force plate system has many advantages over other alternative systems. The static force plate is made of durable materials, is accurate, fits gestation or farrowing stalls, and can measure the weight placed on each hoof independently. The static force plate is a practical application for the commercial swine industry and may allow for earlier detection of lameness problems when compared to subjective lameness evaluation. This in turn will allow for more timely treatment or culling of individual sows from the breeding herd...|$|E

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> balance {{analysis}} was used to estimate the melting rates of the electrodes during pulsed gas metal arc welding ABSTRACT. In order to achieve one drop per pulse operational conditions with pulsed current GMAW, it is nec-essary to contro l both the drop size at the peak current and the melting rate of the electrode. In this study, <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>force</b> balance {{analysis was}} used to predict the droplet size at the peak current and a weighted sum of the melting rates mea-sured under Direct Current Electrode Positive (DCEP) welding was employed to estimate the melting rate with pulsed current.

The model is found to be in good agreement with the experi-mental resu Its when the base current and the load duty cycle are small. When the base current increases above 220 A and the load duty cycle exceeds 1 0 % using 1. 6 -mm-diameter steel electrodes, the prediction of the model deviates sig-nificantly from the experimental results.
