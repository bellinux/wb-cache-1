5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
5|$|When Cope {{arrived back}} in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he was <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E

5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, she {{was named}} the most {{successful}} female singer {{in the history of}} the United Kingdom charts, based upon a tally of her career hits. Madonna would soon succeed Ross as the most successful female artist in the UK. Later that year, Ross presented at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards in September of the year and shocked the audience by touching rapper Lil' Kim's exposed breast, pasty-covered nipple, <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young rapper's brashness.|$|E
25|$|Fred Astaire {{performed}} {{dance in}} four ways. He performed romantic ballroom duets, tap duets, solos, and solos with props. He also usually danced with a partner, for example Ginger Rogers. A {{very well known}} duet with Rogers that he did was “Cheek to Cheek” which is a beautiful dance that looks almost like they are gliding across the dance floor together. He didn’t just perform romantic duets with Rogers. He also did many tap duet numbers with her, like the dance “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet. Astaire’s tap solos, however, {{seemed to be the}} most popular. People were <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> things he could dance with while performing. From coat trees to drum sets, Astaire could do it all.|$|E

Surprise picks up men from the whaler Intrepid Fox, now burnt by USS Norfolk. Knowing where the Norfolk is headed, Aubrey sails along the equator west toward the Marquesas. Maturin is {{disappointed}} and furious that the promise made to let him explore ashore is broken. Aubrey saves Maturin when he falls overboard one evening, but no one misses them until dawn. The two men are rescued by Polynesian women on a pahi, who ultimately leave them on a small island with a fishing line. The launch from the Surprise finds them. Maturin is needed aboard Surprise, as the group sent to board the pahi was cruelly beaten by the women.|$|E
25|$|Tactics of the Samorian army. Samorian armies {{showed the}} {{capability}} of maneuvering against both indigenous and foreign forces. In one of his earliest clashes with the French for example, he executed a sweeping pincer movement to recapture the gold-producing center of Bure, a gambit that threatened {{to cut off the}} French rear, and forced them to withdraw. Additional victories were won at Nfadji and Dadadugu. Flexibility was also seen in Samori's organization, from the use of Konya warrior bands, to the traditional militia call-ups centered on a force of regulars, to his later use of riflemen organized in smaller European-style units. However, although Samori inflicted heavy casualties on the French in several encounters during the 1890s, growing French resources, mobility and firepower placed his regime in ultimate jeopardy. Lacking good firearms and ammunition, major battles against the French were fought by means of carefully arranged fixed lines, to maximize available firepower. Once these were disrupted however, they were difficult to reconstitute. The main forces however turned in excellent performances based on the accounts of French opponents, who were <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> marksmanship, discipline and maneuverability of Samori's forces. Acquisition of new breech-loading guns, enabling a soldier to both reload and fire from a concealed position, improved performance. Samori thus reduced his striking forces in the field as the war against the French progressed, cutting them into smaller detachments armed with better firearms.|$|E

His wife helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising {{his work as a}} songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording.

Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand...

500|$|Balzac {{believed}} that the July Monarchy had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned {{in the name of}} cronyism. Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: [...] ("we were <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry"). Marcas' personal woes– and his tales of life within the corridors of power– strongly reinforce this view.|$|E
500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with CNN-IBN, Madhur Bhandarkar {{said that he}} was preparing to make a film about the fashion industry; he thought the lack of Indian films on this subject prompted him to do so.

Cavaradossi is <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> courage shown by one so gentle and tender: [...] "O dolci mani" [...] ("Oh sweet hands"). The pair ecstatically plan the life they will live away from Rome. Tosca then anxiously instructs Cavaradossi on how to play his part in the mock execution convincingly.

500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves.

The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|Pam {{says that}} her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) always makes her great Christmas gifts so {{she wants to make}} him one too. She creates a {{hand-drawn}} comic book about Jim who gets attacked by a radioactive bear and takes its powers. She asks for others' opinions before giving it to Jim, but most of them give her harsh critiques. Jim gives Pam a beautiful bracelet and he is equally <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> comic book she gives him. Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too afraid to go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E
