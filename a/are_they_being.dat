Selden, who was himself a great ornament of the Common Law, {{and who was}} personally engaged {{in most of the}} impeachments of his time, has written expressly on the judicature in Parliament. In his fourth chapter, intituled, Of Witnesses, he lays down the practice of his time, as well as of ancient times, with respect to the proof by examination; and it is clearly a practice more {{similar to that of the}} Civil than the Common Law. [...] "The practice at this day," [...] says he, [...] "is to swear the witnesses in open House, and then to examine them there, or at a committee, either upon interrogatories agreed upon in the House, or such as the committee in their discretion shall demand. Thus it was in ancient times, as shall appear by the precedents, so many as they <b>are,</b> <b>they</b> <b>being</b> very sparing to record those ceremonies, which I shall briefly recite: I then add those of later times." ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{editorial}} by Eric Milnes in Bridge Magazine complimented the Italian team {{on their}} success in the 1975 Bermuda Bowl, but continued: What a pity it is that these happenings should have been soured by yet another accusation of cheating, this time against the Italian pair Facchini and Zucchelli. Bidding screens were of course being used, so the accusation now was that the pair were communicating by playing [...] "footsy-footsy" [...] under the table. The matter was reported to the World Bridge Federation authorities, who, in an almost unanimous vote, threw out the accusation. They rather spoilt the effect of this, however, by reprimanding the two Italians for [...] "improper conduct with respect to actions of Mr. Zucchini moving his feet unnaturally and touching his partner's feet during the auction and before the opening lead". Well, now, what does this mean? Either the Italians cheated or they didn't. Very well, then. For what <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>being</b> reprimanded?Two points arise. The first is a well-known fact: that eye-witnesses, as every police {{force in the world}} will tell you, are unreliable, and when they are told in advance what to look for they are doubly unreliable. The second point is that players have mannerisms. They are not automatons. One of the best and most respected players in America taps his foot in moments of stress. Others cross and uncross their legs. Others again fiddle with their pencils. The Italianand {{this is a matter of}} record; he was under observation for it in England last yearshuffles his feet about. Is this a cause for reprimand?These events might perhaps have not assumed so much importance had it not been for the prologue to the Championship. The villain of the piece is one Alfred (Freddie) Sheinwold, a man hitherto regarded with respect and indeed affection everywhere, who wrote articles in the Californian publication 'Popular Bridge' in which he attacked the ethics and behaviour of the Italians in a series of astonishing innuendos which have proved to be without foundation. Thenwait for itthe Americans actually selected this man as non-playing captain of the American team. The Italians were outraged. The European Bridge Federation requested the Americans to reconsider. The Americans refused. The wind was sown, but fortunately the whirlwind turned out to be no more than a tiny tornado, through which the Italian ship was able to sail not, perhaps, without hurt, but with its flag still flying.It is time that all this nonsense was stopped, for, unless it is, there is bound to be a schism sooner or later in the World Bridge Federation.

40|$|Representación de las mujeres y designaciones a comisiones legislativas: El caso de las provincias argentinas Tiffany D. Barnes** Abstract. Over {{the last}} two decades a large number of {{countries}} worldwide have adopted a gender quota to increase women’s political representation in the legislature. While quotas are designed to improve women’s representation in legislative positions, it is unclear if electing more women to legislative office is sufficient to accomplish institutional incorporation. Once women are elected to office, <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>being</b> incorporated into the legislative body and gaining their own political power, or <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>being</b> marginalized? Using an original data set that tracks committee appointments in the twenty-two Argentine legislative chambers over an eighteen-year period (from 1992 - 2009), I evaluate the extent to which women have access to powerful committee appoint-ments –beyond traditional women’s domains committees – and how women’s access to committee appoint-ments changes over time. I hypothesize that while women may initially be sidelined, as they gain more experi-ence in the legislature they may overcome institutional barriers and develop institutional knowledge that will better equip them to work within the system to gain access to valuable committee appointments...|$|E

40|$|One of the filmic trends {{which has}} been {{neglected}} by the Academy Awards is the metacinema, which for practical purposes I will {{consider to be a}} cross between the complexities of the self-reflexive cinema (highly connoted with modernism) and the Hollywood Film (the classical films about the urge to ‘make it’ in Hollywood). Indeed, these films have always existed and some, as Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950, USA) and Mulholland Dr. (David Lynch, 2001, FRA/USA), have even made it to the ceremony, but were, predictably, defeated in the main categories, by other more ‘serious’ or less self-reflexive products. The United States has always insisted on not revealing the tricks of the trade while, ironically, generating films that deal with this theme, in order to cater to the curiosity of the metacinema-inclined spectator. For this reason such films are usually about the universe of cinema but not its medium, at least not in a way that discloses the operations of the technical apparatus. Why are these films not viewed as serious enough and artistic enough to be awarded Oscars by the Academy in the categories of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematography? <b>Are</b> <b>they</b> <b>being</b> discarded for the same reasons that comedy and musicals usually are?
