5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was no interest in London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E
5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so {{impressed}} that {{she gave him the}} original trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Boucher's home.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its history, the {{community}} has faced <b>a</b> number of <b>fires.</b> In addition to the 1849 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> St. Joseph Prairie, there was <b>a</b> 1955 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the infirmary at the Dubuque motherhouse, <b>a</b> 1958 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Our Lady of the Angels (a BVM grammar school in Chicago), and <b>a</b> 1984 <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Clarke College.|$|R

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Manchester City's Hyde Road {{ground in}} 1920, the club {{considered}} {{a move to}} the Belle Vue athletics stadium, but it was deemed too small. At the behest of Belle Vue director John Henry Iles and John Ayrton, Manchester Central, was formed, and played its home matches at the speedway stadium. One of Manchester Central's first matches at Belle Vue was a visit by FA Cup holders Blackburn Rovers in September 1928. The club attempted unsuccessfully to join The Football League in 1930 and in 1931; with momentum lost, the club faded, and folded in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Frome's only cinema, the Westway, is in Cork Street in {{the town}} centre, which closed in March 2016 and re-opened February 2017, after {{changing}} hands and undergoing extensive refurbishment. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the cinema in October 2016 the cinema was {{thought to have been}} started deliberately. There is also an arts centre, The Black Swan, and the town is part of the West Country Carnival circuit. The Glastonbury Festival takes place only 15 miles southwest of Frome at Worthy Farm, Pilton. Frome also boasts two comedy clubs - the Submarine Comedy Club at the Archangel and the Cheesy Grin Comedy Club at the Cheese & Grain bar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seasons}} {{following}} the FA Cup triumph, {{the club was}} dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United. <b>A</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 1957, {{motor car}} 66.03 and center car 18821 were damaged in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Kristiansand. Both were retired {{due to the}} large damages. On 8 June 1969, a unit derailed at between Eidanger and Oklungen, but was restored. Motor car 66.02 was exposed to a fire on 4 June 1975, and again on 28 December 1976. After the latter incident, the car was retired.|$|E
5|$|The 6S {{units were}} {{intended}} to be introduced into service in June 1957. On 5April <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there. As a result, locomotive-hauled trains were banned from the station. A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day. Two units coupled together formed the 06:58 and 07:26 Hastings–Cannon Street services in the morning, and the 17:18 and 18:03 Cannon Street–Hastings services in the evening. From 17June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day. The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars. The cause was attributed to a patient who was lighting curtains on fire with a cigarette lighter.|$|E

5|$|After Indian Independence, Mysore city {{remained}} {{as part of}} the Mysore State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed governor) of the state. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore city. Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute. Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo.|$|E
5|$|At 2:42 PM on April 11, 1945, off {{the coast}} of Kikaijima Island, a Japanese fighter pilot in an A6M5c Zero {{launched}} a kamikaze attack on the USS Missouri. Bill Obitz, a Seaman at the time, recalled that the attacking plane approached at an extreme angle and estimated that it was 20 feet (6 m) above the water. Although struck by intense antiaircraft fire, the plane survived and struck the ship's starboard side at frame 169 below the main deck. While the impact of one of the plane's wings started <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> 5-inch mount number 3, its 500-pound bomb did not detonate, so the damage was minimal. There were no American casualties, but the Japanese pilot died. Parts of the plane's wreckage and {{the top half of the}} pilot's body landed on board the Missouri. The plane's wing was turned over to the crew to be cut up for souvenirs.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and {{his wife}} Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was {{enlarged}} and given an upper floor {{for the use of}} the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.|$|E

5|$|Many of Rix Nicholas's works {{went into}} private {{collections}} for which records are limited. Many more were burned in <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the family property {{after her death}} in the 1960s. Though her fortunes declined {{in the latter part}} of her career, the twenty-first century saw a renewed appreciation of her output. Her oeuvre is represented in most major Australia public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Queensland Art Gallery, as well as in other collections including that of the Australian War Memorial. Internationally, Rix Nicholas is represented in the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume and Leicester Gallery, as well as by her works in the Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, both Marge and Mr. Burns want Homer {{to go on}} {{the same}} rafting trip. Homer starts with being on his family's raft, and then swims back and forth between that and Mr. Burns's raft. Marge discovers that he has double booked the weekend while both rafts float near a waterfall, and is upset that he chose to do work on a family outing. Homer can only save one raft, and he saves the one {{containing}} his family. As Mr. Burns and the executives are about to go over the waterfall, Marlowe rides up on a motorboat and carries Mr. Burns to safety, while the executives fall over the edge. Homer goes over the waterfall by himself, but is completely unharmed and finds gold. Later, at their house, Homer tells Marge that he is a safety inspector again. Fireworks go off outside, and it is revealed that they were caused by <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, presumably because Homer failed at his job.|$|E
5|$|Nine manuscripts {{survive in}} whole or in part, though not all are of equal {{historical}} value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the Chronicle {{is in the form of}} annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E

5|$|On October 25, 1968, <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> {{the former}} {{incinerator}} plant off Route 611, where the Peace Candle was being stored, destroyed the four smaller candles {{that surround the}} base of the larger candle. The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating {{the construction of a new}} Peace Candle prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them. Instead, the committee would build an entirely new candle within a year.|$|E
5|$|The Illinois Freedom Bell {{is located}} in Mount Morris, Illinois, United States, and is the {{official}} freedom bell of the U.S. state of Illinois. The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin as {{a replica of the}} Liberty Bell in 1862. In 1910, while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the church, the ice cracked and the bell sank {{to the bottom of the}} lake. It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966. The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival, and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square. The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States. The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The uniform {{used by the}} Confederate States Marine Corps resembled that {{prescribed}} for the Confederate Army. However, there is controversy {{about some of the}} exact details of the uniform, since the CSMC was not as large, and many of its records were destroyed. In 1865, right after the war's end, Lloyd J. Beall, commander of the CSMC, had <b>a</b> <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> his home which destroyed most of the CSMC's records. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out of the stores of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray, and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from Russia, and from Great Britain and its empire, mainly Canada. This created a fairly unusual look.|$|E
