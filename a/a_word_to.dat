500|$|Other {{countries}} {{also use}} <b>a</b> <b>word</b> similar <b>to</b> trillion to mean 1012, etc. Whilst {{a few of}} these countries like English use <b>a</b> <b>word</b> similar <b>to</b> billion to mean 109, most like Arabic have kept a traditional long scale <b>word</b> similar <b>to</b> milliard for 109. Some examples of short scale use, and the words used for 109 and 1012, are ...|$|R

25|$|These rules make Hungarian {{alphabetic}} ordering algorithmically difficult (one {{has to know}} the correct segmentation of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> sort it correctly), which was a problem for computer software development.|$|E
25|$|In Scrabble notation, {{a dollar}} sign is placed after <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> {{indicate}} that it is valid according to the North American word lists, but not according to the British word lists.|$|E

25|$|In grammar, {{inflection}} or inflexion – {{sometimes called}} accidence – is the modification of <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> express different grammatical {{categories such as}} tense, case, voice, aspect, person, number, gender, and mood. The inflection of verbs is also called conjugation, and one can refer to the inflection of nouns, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, determiners, participles, prepositions, postpositions, numerals, articles etc, as declension.|$|E
25|$|Empty cells do not {{necessarily}} imply that a particular language is lacking <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> describe the concept, but rather that the word for the concept in that language may be formed from another stem {{and is not a}} cognate with the other words in the row or that a loanword is used in its place.|$|E
25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money in their pockets, simultaneously abstaining from speech and not asking for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and without <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> anyone, study Torah.|$|E

25|$|That the State {{ought to}} confine itself to what regards the State, or the {{creatures of the}} State, namely, the {{exterior}} establishment of its religion; its magistracy; its revenue; its military force by sea and land; the corporations that owe their existence to its fiat; in <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>to</b> every thing that is truly and properly public, to the public peace, to the public safety, to the public order, to the public prosperity.|$|E
25|$|Phrasing of the {{instructions}} {{associated with the}} test has had a dramatic impact on an amnesic's ability {{to complete the task}} successfully. When performing a word-stem completion test, patients were able to successfully complete the task when asked to complete the stem using the first word that came to mind, but when explicitly asked to recall <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> complete the stem that was on the study list, patients performed at below-average levels.|$|E
25|$|Cued recall is when {{a person}} is given a list of items to {{remember}} and is then tested with cues to remember material. Researchers have used this procedure to test memory. Participants are given pairs, usually of words, A1-B1, A2-B2...An-Bn (n is the number of pairs in a list) to study. Then the experimenter gives the participant <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> cue the participant to recall the word with which it was originally paired. The word presentation can either be visual or auditory.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} long {{scale is}} used by most Continental European countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil). These countries use <b>a</b> <b>word</b> similar <b>to</b> billion to mean 1012. Some use <b>a</b> <b>word</b> similar <b>to</b> milliard to mean 109, while others use <b>a</b> <b>word</b> or phrase equivalent to thousand millions.|$|R
25|$|Compared to NOR flash, {{replacing}} single transistors with serial-linked groups adds {{an extra}} level of addressing. Whereas NORflash might address memory by page then word, NANDflash might address it by page, word and bit. Bit-level addressing suits bit-serial applications (such as hard disk emulation), which access only one bit at a time. Execute-in-place applications, {{on the other}} hand, require every bit in <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> be accessed simultaneously. This requires word-level addressing. In any case, both bit and word addressing modes are possible with either NOR or NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|After beating Mars Bar in a foot {{race and}} goading him into {{crashing}} Piper's birthday {{party at the}} McNabs' house, Jeffrey is homeless again. He moves back into the buffalo pen, and runs for miles every morning before Two Mills wakes up. Before long, Mars Bar starts running with him as if by coincidence, and they never say <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> each other. One day they come across a hysterical Piper McNab, who frantically leads them to Russell, stuck on the trolley trestle where Jeffrey's parents died. He walks away silently, nearly unconscious and stunned by fear, while Mars Bar rescues Russell, becoming a hero in his eyes. Jeffrey retreats once again to the buffalo pen, where Mars Bar leads Amanda to it. She brings him to her house in a huff, with Jeffrey and Mars Bar following her.|$|E
25|$|The {{truth is}} that Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>to</b> reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E

25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in <b>a</b> <b>word,</b> <b>to</b> pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

500|$|Judicial {{review is}} {{the means by}} which legal rights are {{protected}} and good governance enforced. The ability of the courts to judicially review legislation and administrative action is considered an element of the rule of law. In R. v. Committee of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting for the Visitor of the University of London, ex parte Vijayatunga (1987), Judge Simon Brown said: [...] "Judicial review is the exercise of the court's inherent power at common law to determine whether action is lawful or not; in <b>a</b> <b>word</b> <b>to</b> uphold the rule of law".|$|E
