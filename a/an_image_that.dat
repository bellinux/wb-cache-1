5|$|Caracalla is {{presented}} in ancient sources as a tyrant and cruel leader, <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> has survived into modernity. Dio Cassius and Herodian present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's memory was revived {{in the works of}} French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of King Louis XVI. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His rule is remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.|$|E
5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the Presentation in the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade with <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
5|$|The {{musical score}} for the action {{role-playing}} game Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off game called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, whose previous work included Parasite Eve, Legend of Mana, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Final Fantasy XV was her first time composing for the Final Fantasy series, so she took a more tentative approach than her Kingdom Hearts projects. Shimomura was involved with the project when XV was still titled Versus XIII, being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year development cycle. In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> seemed wrong. Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as Final Fantasy XV was fairly sporadic. Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on her work and other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack. Other composers {{who worked on the}} game were Tetsuya Shibata, Yoshino Aoki, Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin would look like had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing {{the skin of his}} face and performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} this mystification {{lies in the}} {{excitement}} brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by Leo Africanus: Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as Gao and Walata. In West Africa the city holds <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> {{has been compared to}} Europe's view on Athens.

25|$|The {{resulting}} {{compression ratio}} can be varied according to need by being {{more or less}} aggressive in the divisors used in the quantization phase. Ten to one compression usually results in <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> cannot be distinguished by eye from the original. A compression ratio of 100:1 is usually possible, but will look distinctly artifacted compared to the original. The appropriate level of compression depends on the use to which the image will be put.|$|E

25|$|There is {{support for}} several methods of {{sharpening}} and blurring images, including the blur and sharpen tool. The unsharp mask tool {{is used to}} sharpen an image selectively— it only sharpens areas of <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> are sufficiently detailed. The Unsharp Mask tool is considered to give more targeted results for photographs than a normal sharpening filter. The Selective Gaussian Blur tool works in a similar way, except it blurs areas of an image with little detail.|$|E
25|$|Power consumption: While an OLED will consume around 40% of {{the power}} of an LCD {{displaying}} <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> is primarily black, for the majority of images it will consume 60–80% {{of the power}} of an LCD. However, an OLED can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background, such as a document or web site. This can lead to reduced battery life in mobile devices, when white backgrounds are used.|$|E
25|$|JPEG is {{also not}} well suited to files that will undergo {{multiple}} edits, as some image quality will usually be lost each time the image is decompressed and recompressed, particularly if the image is cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed– see digital generation loss for details. To avoid this, <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> is being modified or may be modified in the future can be saved in a lossless format, with a copy exported as JPEG for distribution.|$|E

25|$|By their nature, these {{additive}} {{systems were}} very wasteful of light. Absorption {{by the color}} filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color video and computer display systems in common use today.|$|E

The user may upload the image to the forum database, or may provide a link to an image on a separate website.

25|$|Colour apodization is a {{technique}} combining a modified lens design with image processing to achieve an increased depth of field. The lens is modified such that each colour channel has a different lens aperture. For example, the red channel may be f/2.4, green may be f/2.4, whilst the blue channel may be f/5.6. Therefore, the blue channel will have a greater depth of field than the other colours. The image processing identifies blurred regions in the red and green channels and in these regions copies the sharper edge data from the blue channel. The result is <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>that</b> combines the best features from the different f-numbers, (Kay 2011).|$|E
