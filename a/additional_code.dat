25|$|Programming {{languages}} {{commonly associated}} with buffer overflows include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data {{in any part of}} memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows, but requires <b>additional</b> <b>code</b> and processing time. Modern operating systems use a variety of techniques to combat malicious buffer overflows, notably by randomizing the layout of memory, or deliberately leaving space between buffers and looking for actions that write into those areas ("canaries").|$|E

25|$|As the war progressed, <b>additional</b> <b>code</b> {{words were}} added on and {{incorporated}} program-wide. In other instances, informal short-cut code words were devised {{for a particular}} campaign and not disseminated beyond the area of operation. To ensure a consistent use of code terminologies throughout the Pacific Theater, representative code talkers {{of each of the}} U.S. Marine divisions met in Hawaii to discuss shortcomings in the code, incorporate new terms into the system, and update their codebooks. These representatives in turn trained other code talkers who could not attend the meeting. For example, the Navajo word for buzzard, , was used for bomber, while the code word used for submarine, , meant iron fish in Navajo. The last of the original 29 Navajo code talkers who developed the code, Chester Nez, died on June 4, 2014.|$|E

For example, Mortal Kombat 3 includes a hidden game of Galaga {{and there is}} a hidden game of Pong in Mortal Kombat II. Many extras in the series have only been accessible through very challenging, demanding, and sometimes coincidental requirements. The Sega Mega Drive/Genesis versions contains some unique eggs, such as [...] "Fergality". The Sega Mega-CD version also contained an <b>additional</b> <b>code</b> (known as the [...] "Dad's Code"), which changed the names of the fighters to that of characters from the classic comedy series Dad's Army. Popular characters of Reptile and Jade were originally introduced as hidden enemies, becoming playable after returning in subsequent games.|$|E
500|$|Reserved code {{elements}} are codes {{which have become}} obsolete, or are {{required in order to}} enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific <b>additional</b> <b>code</b> elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. Codes are usually reserved for former countries, overseas territories, international organizations, and special nationality status. The reserved alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories (click on the links for the reserved codes of each category): ...|$|E

500|$|The Dark Engine was {{designed}} to be reusable, and to give programmers the ability to easily integrate their work. LeBlanc wrote the [...] "Dark Object System", which became the center of this concept. According to Leonard, the object system was a [...] "general database for managing the individual objects in a simulation". Designers were able to alter the game's behavior by manipulating objects—the content that composes the game—without writing <b>additional</b> <b>code.</b> The system also managed source data, the game's tangible content such as textures, maps, models and sounds. An unfinished build of the Dark Engine was used to develop System Shock 2, a collaboration between Looking Glass and Irrational Games. The object system worked so well that Thief and System Shock 2 used the same executable for most of their development.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was {{born out of}} desire to see a global {{illumination}} solution used for the game's lighting — that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others. To this extent, development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use distributed rendering over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer action stage in around two or three days. Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's [...] "Light Field" [...] technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting. Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development [...] "silos" [...] were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the Hedgehog Engine, and one for the PlayStation 2 and Wii version, which instead utilizes a modified version of an existing, internal Sega engine. Hashimoto, who had never directed a Sonic game before, incorporated new features such as a [...] "Quick Step" [...] mechanic allowing players to dodge obstacles with the L and R triggers. Hashimoto sought to combine the best qualities of 2D and 3D Sonic gameplay and address the criticisms directed at previous 3D entries in the franchise. <b>Additional</b> <b>code</b> to dynamically adjust the speed of the game for different situations was used to properly balance its fast pace with traditional platforming elements.|$|E
2500|$|Hybrid kernels {{are used}} in most {{commercial}} operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT 3.1, NT 3.5, NT 3.51, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Apple Inc's own macOS uses a hybrid kernel called XNU which is based upon code from OSF/1's Mach kernel (OSFMK 7.3) and FreeBSD's monolithic kernel. They are similar to micro kernels, except they include some <b>additional</b> <b>code</b> in kernel-space to increase performance. These kernels represent a compromise that was implemented by some developers before it was demonstrated that pure micro kernels can provide high performance. These types of kernels are extensions of micro kernels with some properties of monolithic kernels. Unlike monolithic kernels, these types of kernels are unable to load modules at runtime on their own. Hybrid kernels are micro kernels that have some [...] "non-essential" [...] code in kernel-space {{in order for the}} code to run more quickly than it would were it to be in user-space. Hybrid kernels are a compromise between the monolithic and microkernel designs. This implies running some services (such as the network stack or the filesystem) in kernel space to reduce the performance overhead of a traditional microkernel, but still running kernel code (such as device drivers) as servers in user space.|$|E
