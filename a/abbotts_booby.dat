50|$|Within {{the family}} itself, three living genera—Sula (boobies, 6 species), Papasula (<b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby),</b> Morus (gannets, 3 species)—are recognized. A 2011 study of {{multiple}} genes found <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> to be basal {{to all other}} gannets and boobies, and likely to have diverged from them around 22 million years ago, and the ancestors of the gannets and remaining boobies split around 17 million years ago. The most recent common ancestor of all boobies lived in the late Miocene around 6 million years ago, after which time the boobies steadily diverged. The gannets split more recently, only around 2.5 million years ago.|$|R
40|$|National audienceAbbott’s Booby Papasula abbotti is a relictual species now {{endemic to}} Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, {{and one of}} the world’s most {{threatened}} seabird species. While actual and potential threats to the species on Christmas Island are being managed, no conservation measures concerning the marine habitat of the birds, such as the delineation of marine Important Bird Areas (IBA), are currently being implemented as knowledge on the foraging areas of <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Booby</b> has been scarce. Using GPS-loggers to track <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Boobies</b> during their foraging trips, the present study provides detailed information about the foraging movements of the species during early chick-rearing. The birds foraged relatively close to the island with a median range of 56. 8 km (range = 3. 6 – 56. 7 km). They chose trip directions according to their nesting sites in the north and south of the island and foraged preferably in north-westerly and south-easterly directions of Christmas Island, respectively. Applying the protocol of BirdLife International, the tracking data were used to identify a potential IBA for <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Booby</b> during early chick-rearing. According to the small foraging distances and the limited range of trip bearings, the delimited IBA was relatively small, encompassing only a narrow corridor of about 4, 500 km 2 to the north-west and south-east of Christmas Island. Given the small size and low economic relevance of this area, the delineation of this IBA appears feasible and would be an important first step to protect <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Boobies</b> at sea as well as the species’ foraging habitat...|$|R
50|$|The three gannet {{species are}} now usually {{placed in the}} genus Morus, <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> in Papasula, and the {{remaining}} boobies in Sula. However, some authorities believe that all nine sulid species should be considered congeneric, in Sula. At one time, the various gannet species {{were considered to be}} a single species.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> (Papasula abbotti) is an {{endangered}} seabird of the sulid family, which includes gannets and boobies. It {{is a large}} booby, smaller than gannets, and is placed within its own monotypic genus. It was first identified from a specimen collected by William Louis Abbott, who discovered it on Assumption Island in 1892.|$|R
50|$|Christmas Island National Park {{includes}} all known <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> nest sites. It {{was created in}} 1980 and was subsequently expanded to cover 60% of the island. The population was monitored from 1982 to 1993, and in 1984 20% of mined areas next to nesting sites had been replanted. The Environment Australia <b>Abbott's</b> <b>Booby</b> Recovery Plan aims to regenerate forests and help prevent further decline in the species. Forest rehabilitation has now been attempted in about 30% of abandoned mining areas, {{with a focus on}} areas close to primary forest where new growth could act as a wind break. Most of the planted trees are Foundation species, with non-native species being used if they don't invade the environment. Part of the forest regeneration project is financed by the phosphate mining company as part of their lease agreement.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSeabirds of {{tropical}} oceanic waters {{have to cope}} with an extremely oligotrophic habitat, but little is known about their foraging behaviour and flexibility which enables them to catch sufficient prey for themselves and their chicks. In a 7 yr study encompassing contrasting oceanographic conditions, the foraging behaviour of chick-rearing <b>Abbott's</b> <b>boobies</b> Papasula abbotti, seabirds endemic to Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, was investigated using GPS- and diveloggers to examine (1) if the species exhibits foraging strategies that indicate specific adaptations to unproductive tropical oceanic waters, and (2) if (or how) the birds adjust their foraging behaviour to inter-annually varying marine conditions. <b>Abbott's</b> <b>boobies</b> displayed a number of distinct characteristics in their foraging behaviour: flight velocities were slower and diving activity lower than in other booby species. Foraging efficiency was enhanced by distinct temporal tuning of diving activity and trip timing, peaking in the morning and again in the afternoon. The birds exhibited some flexibility in foraging behaviour: when conditions deteriorated (i. e. when waters became warmer and less productive), their diet composition changed, they increased their trip durations, trip range and maximum dive depth, although other parameters such as diving activity and sinuosity did not change. Remarkably, the time spent on the water increased simultaneously with trip length. By those adaptations, <b>Abbott's</b> <b>boobies</b> were able to keep their body condition (as well as that of their chicks) stable even under poor marine conditions...|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that the population size will decrease more than 80% {{over the next three}} generations, or 120 years. Current decline is attributed to a low recruitment rate and the negative effects of wind turbulence on a breeding population. Due to their small population, limited habitat, low fecundity, and limited distribution, <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> is at high risk of extinction if further habitat disturbance occurs.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. —We {{describe}} the first documented record of <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Booby</b> Papasula abbotti in the North Pacific, a female observed and photographed at Rota, the southernmost {{island in the}} Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (USA), in northern Micronesia, on 17 April 2007. Furthermore, on the same island, we also observed and photographed a subadult Red-footed Booby Sula sula with a black-tipped pink bill {{very similar to that}} of Abbott’s. The available evidence suggests that pink is a normal but poorly documented bill colour variation for some older immature Red-footed Boobies and not a diagnostic feature of Abbott’s or an indication of hybridisation between the two species. <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>Booby</b> Papasula abbotti is a rare and endangered member of the Sulidae with a relict distribution (BirdLife International 2000, Commonwealth of Australia 2001). Originally placed in the genus Sula, it is quite distinct from the more typical boobies (Olson & Warheit 1988). The species is currently known to nest only on the Australian territory of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean (Yorkston & Green 1997; Fig. 1 a), and is observed Figure 1. a) Map of the Indo- Pacific showing important localities mentioned in the text; b) The Marian...|$|R
50|$|<b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> breeds {{only in a}} few {{spots on}} the Australian {{territory}} of Christmas Island in the eastern Indian Ocean, although it formerly had a much wider range. It has white plumage with black markings, and is adapted for long-distance flight. It forages around Christmas Island, often around nutrient-rich oceanic upwellings, although individuals can travel for thousands of kilometres. Pairs mate for life and raise one chick {{every two or three}} years, nesting near the top of emergent trees in the rainforest canopy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> is {{the only}} booby {{restricted}} to a single location, although its former distribution covered much of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. There is fossil evidence of its former presence in the South Pacific, and eyewitness reports of it formerly breeding on the Mascarene Islands. In April 2007, an individual of this species was photographed at a booby colony on Rota in the Pacific Ocean, and the same individual has been seen off-and-on in the red-footed booby colony there through at least 2011 (Pratt in press).|$|R
50|$|In 1976 {{he moved}} to Australia, to Monash University in Melbourne, Victoria. There he was {{involved}} in an investigation of <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> on Christmas Island which was threatened by phosphate mining. He served on the Field Investigation Committee of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) for which he organised the Rolling Bird Survey project. However, he is best known for long-term studies of the little penguin at Phillip Island and in Port Phillip Bay at St Kilda, in collaboration with Pauline Reilly and others.|$|R
50|$|Christmas Island National Park is a {{national}} park occupying most of Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean southwest of Indonesia. The park is home to many species of animal and plant life, including the eponymous red crab, whose annual migration sees around 100 million crabs move to the sea to spawn. Christmas Island is the only nesting place for the endangered <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> and critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebird, and {{the wide range of}} other endemic species makes the island of significant interest to the scientific community.|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} at sea of {{the eight}} seabird species that breed on Christmas Island were documented during four surveys in the eastern Indian Ocean. Common Noddies and Brown Boobies were seen only within 200 - 250 km of the island, whereas Red-footed Boobies occurred up to 800 - 900 km away. The endemic <b>Abbott's</b> <b>Boobies</b> probably feed over the South Java Current. The two species of frigatebirds were recorded over 700 km from Christmas Island, one species possibly much farther, and the two species of tropicbirds up to 1500 km from the island...|$|R
50|$|Even {{a minimal}} decline in habitat quality {{can have a}} {{significant}} impact on these birds. During 1965-1987 phosphate mining destroyed one third of the <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby's</b> nesting habitat. Degeneration has continued, with the health of individual trees decreasing. Clearings left over from logging have increased wind in the canopy, generating turbulence up to 300 m downwind of the clearings. This causes lower breeding success due to chicks being dislodged and not surviving their first flight. Adult survival is also reduced due to increased risk of them falling to the ground when landing. This affects 36% of the current population.|$|R
50|$|<b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> is {{the largest}} of all booby species, and is adapted to long-distance flight. Individuals can reach 80 cm from beak to tail, and weigh about 1460 g. It is {{distinguished}} from other sulids in the region due to its black and white plumage. They have an off-white plumage, which contrasts with black eye patches, black wings and tails, and black flank marks. Their feet are blue and webbed, with black outer ends. Males have pale grey bills with a black tip, whereas females have pink bills with a black tip. Chicks have white down and a cape of black scapular feathers.|$|R
50|$|The bird family Sulidae {{comprises}} the gannets and boobies. Collectively called sulids, they are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish and similar prey. The ten species {{in this family}} are often considered congeneric in older sources, placing all in the genus Sula. However, Sula (true boobies) and Morus (gannets) can be readily distinguished by morphological and behavioral and DNA sequence characters. <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> (Papasula) is given its own genus as it stands apart from both in these respects. It {{appears to be a}} distinct and ancient lineage, maybe closer to the gannets than to the true boobies.|$|R
50|$|The site {{contains}} a unique stand of enormous Tahitian chestnut trees. Sydney Dale is a recorded {{site for the}} critically endangered endemic fern, the Christmas Island spleenwort. The various wetland types of the Dales support populations of endemic and threatened animals, including the Christmas Island hawk-owl, Christmas Island goshawk, <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby,</b> Christmas Island shrew and the Christmas Island blind-snake. Coastline habitats within the site provide breeding and spawning grounds for red and blue crabs. The main threat to the site comes from introduced species, in particular the yellow crazy ant {{and the development of}} Immigration Reception Centre nearby, above the springs.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> {{population}} {{is the best}} documented, and smallest, of all sulid populations. It was first assessed in 1967, resulting in an estimate of 2,300 breeding pairs. By 1983 the number of breeding pairs had declined to 1,900. The most comprehensive survey was made in 1991, and included new breeding sites that were unknown in previous surveys. It brought the estimate of breeding pairs up to 2,500, with {{the total number of}} mature individuals being placed at 6,000. A helicopter survey in 2002 noted 1,500 nest sites. The population was stable from 1991 to 2002.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Bryan Nelson MBE FRSE (14 March 1932 - 29 June 2015) was a British ornithologist, {{environmental}} {{activist and}} academic. He {{was a prominent}} authority on seabirds, publishing numerous books and articles on gannets, cormorants and other species, teaching zoology at the University of Aberdeen, and conducting pioneering ornithological research in Jordan, Christmas Island and the Galápagos Islands. In his lifetime, Nelson was [...] "acclaimed as the world's leading expert on the northern gannet". [...] He {{also contributed to the}} creation of Christmas Island National Park, which helped to preserve the habitat of the endangered <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby.</b>|$|R
50|$|Concerns were {{expressed}} in the early 1970s {{about the effect of}} phosphate mining on the flora and fauna of Christmas Island. A particular focus was on the habitat of <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> (Papasula abbotti), which appeared in danger of extinction. In 1974 a governmental committee examined the environmental impact of mining and other commercial activities and advised on measures to protect the island. The committee's recommendation that an area of the island be set aside for conservation was implemented in a series of measures culminating in the establishment of the Christmas Island National Park on 21 February 1980 {{under the terms of the}} National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, Nelson {{spent a year}} on Christmas Island, {{studying}} the rare <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby,</b> whose only habitat was threatened by phosphate mining on the island. In later years, Nelson gave evidence to the Australian government about the ecological impacts of mining on Christmas Island, which ultimately contributed {{to the creation of}} Christmas Island National Park to protect the island's biodiversity. In 1968, Nelson and his wife travelled to Jordan, where he served {{as the director of the}} Azraq Desert Research Station and studied the migratory birds of the region. He also performed an in-depth study of a colony of Australasian gannets at Cape Kidnappers, New Zealand.|$|R
5000|$|He died at {{his farm}} on the Elk River in Maryland {{of heart disease}} after a long illness, leaving his books, papers and 20% of his estate to the Smithsonian Institution. [...] At {{the time of his}} death he was the largest single {{contributor}} to the collections of the museum. [...] Abbott’s name is commemorated in the names of numerous animal taxa, including those of Abbott's crested lizard (Gonocephalus abbotti [...] ), Abbott's day gecko (Phelsuma abbotti [...] ), <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> (Papasula abbotti), <b>Abbott's</b> starling (Cinnyricinclus femoralis), pygmy cuckoo-shrike (Coracina abbotti), Abbott's sunbird (Cinnyris sovimanga abbotti [...] ) and Abbott's duiker (Cephalophus spadix). Plants named after him include Cyathea abbottii, a tree-fern native to Hispaniola.|$|R
50|$|Assumption Island {{was once}} {{home to a}} great {{diversity}} of seabirds, including the <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby,</b> which is now confined to a single breeding island: Christmas Island, in the eastern Indian Ocean. Efforts are now underway by the Seychelles Islands Foundation, in conjunction with Island Conservation Society and the Islands Development Company, to restore the habitat of the island. The first successful step in this process was the removal of invasive, introduced bird species, Madagascar fody and red-whiskered bulbul.A notable feature of this island is the Assumption Island day gecko, a subspecies of gecko found only on this island. An endemic race of souimanga sunbird once breaded on the island, called Abbott's Booby.The nature documentary of Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle, The Silent World was partially shot on Assumption. The island {{is known for its}} rich fish life.|$|R
50|$|The first {{specimen}} {{was collected}} from Assumption Island in 1892 by American naturalist William Louis Abbott, northwest of Madagascar, {{although there is}} debate on whether he actually collected it from the nearby Glorioso Island. It was described by Robert Ridgway in 1893. In 1988 it was placed in its own genus by Olson & Warheit 1988. The basal characters present in this species suggest {{it may be an}} early branch of the sulid family, predating the split between gannets and other boobies. This was reinforced by analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in 1997, which indicated <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> was an early offshoot of the gannets rather than the other boobies. However, 2011 study of multiple genes found it to be basal to all other gannets and boobies, and likely to have diverged from them around 22 million years ago.|$|R
25|$|The {{island is}} {{a focal point}} for seabirds of various species. Eight species or {{subspecies}} of seabirds nest on it. The most numerous is the red-footed booby, which nests in colonies, using trees on many parts of the shore terrace. The widespread brown booby nests on the ground {{near the edge of the}} seacliff and inland cliffs. <b>Abbott's</b> <b>booby</b> (listed as endangered) nests on tall emergent trees of the western, northern and southern plateau rainforest, the only remaining nesting habitat for this bird in the world. Another endangered and endemic bird, the Christmas frigatebird, has nesting areas on the northeastern shore terraces. The more widespread great frigatebirds nest in semi-deciduous trees on the shore terrace, with the greatest concentrations being in the North West and South Point areas. The common noddy and two species of bosun or tropicbirds, with their brilliant gold or silver plumage and distinctive streamer tail feathers, also nest on the island.|$|R
40|$|The melanocortin- 1 {{receptor}} (MC 1 R) {{has been}} linked to intraspecific variation of melanin-based plumage color in several unrelated bird species. However, its involvement in interspecific variation has far less evidence. The Sulidae is a family in the Suliformes composed of 10 species of pelagic seabirds, distributed in 3 genera. There is significant variation in the amount and distribution of melanin pigments among species in the family Sulidae, and 2 species, the brown booby (Sula leucogaster) and the red-footed booby (S. sula), present plumage polymorphisms, with the latter being {{considered one of the most}} plumage polymorphic birds. We performed a survey of the MC 1 R evolution in 68 individuals representing all 9 species in the Sulidae, except the <b>Abbott’s</b> <b>booby,</b> to determine the role played by this locus in explaining the melanic variation observed in the Sulidae. We found the amino acid substitution R 112 H to be in full concordance with the plumage color observed in the brown booby, which shows a unique phaeomelanin-dominant coloration. Furthermore, all amino acid residues known to be important for function at the MC 1 R were completely conserved in the Sulidae, except for the previously described V 85 M and H 207 R substitutions among the 2 red-footed booby’s color morphs. A total of 14 substitutions were inferred from estimated ancestral nodes throughout the Sulidae phylogeny. Finally, we found evidence that the MC 1 R is under strong purifying selection in all Sulid species. This study provides additional evidence of th...|$|R
