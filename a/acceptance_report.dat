40|$|The Generic Methodology for Verification, Validation and Acceptance (GM-VV) is {{intended}} to provide a common generic framework for making formal and well balanced acceptance decisions on a specific usage of models, simulations and data. GM-VV will offer the international M&S community with a Verification, Validation (VV) and Acceptance methodology that consistently embraces {{a wide variety of}} M&S technologies and application domains. The GM-VV builds upon a triad of three pillars; the products, the organization and process pillar. At the centre of the products pillar stands the GM-VV data information model. The GM-VV data information model is the structural model for the GM-VV project memory approach. This project memory not only stores the GM-VV core products but also serve as the data and information source for generating these products. In this paper the formal specification of the GM-VV data information model and its underlying principles, concepts and methods are presented. The paper shows how this model is used in the GM-VV project memory approach to produce the core GM-VV products being: the acceptance plan, the verification & validation plan, the evidence, the verification &validation report, and the <b>acceptance</b> <b>report...</b>|$|E
40|$|Non-LGBT Americans are {{increasingly}} accepting of LGBT people, but many don't realize what battles {{remain to be}} fought for full equality, a new GLAAD report indicates. GLAAD's second annual Accelerating <b>Acceptance</b> <b>report,</b> based on information gathered for the organization by the Harris Poll last fall, found that respondents' comfort level with LGBT people rose since the previous year. But many participants in the survey were unaware of the challenges still facing LGBT Americans. Half of non-LGBT respondents thought LGBT people had "the same rights as anybody else," as the survey put it, when actually 31 states have no law preventing a person from being fired or denied housing simply for being LGBT. The assumption that LGBT people have equal rights across the board {{may be due to}} the widespread publicity about last year's Supreme Court marriage equality ruling, GLAAD officials said. A significant minority of non-LGBT respondents [...] 27 percent [...] thought violence against transgender people was not a serious problem, even though at least 21 trans women, most of them women of color, were murdered in the U. S. in 2015. Also, 37 percent said homelessness among LGBT youth was not a major issue, when in reality an estimated 40 percent of homeless young people identify as LGBT. And a third of non-LGBT respondents, including some allies, said they had no strong opinion about LGBT issues. The 2015 survey was conducted online October 5 - 7 among 2, 032 Americans age 18 and older. The non-LGBT sub-sample was 1, 781. The previous survey was conducted in November 2014 and involved 2, 010 American adults, 1, 821 of them non-LGBT...|$|E

Method: Perceived competence and acceptance of 17 children with intellectual disability, included in mainstream classes, were assessed using the Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children (PSPCSA) and compared with (a) independently rated academic work samples and measures of social status, and (b) measures of perceived competence and <b>acceptance</b> <b>reported</b> for other populations of individuals with and without disability. Results: Perceived competence and acceptance were positive and comparable to previously reported results for individuals with disability and young children without disability.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} show {{the importance of}} acceptance {{in the treatment of}} chronic tinnitus. So far, very limited research investigating the different levels of tinnitus acceptance has been conducted. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the quality of life (QoL) and psychological distress in patients with chronic tinnitus who reported different levels of tinnitus acceptance. The sample consisted of outpatients taking part in a tinnitus coping group (n = 97). Correlations between tinnitus acceptance, psychological distress, and QoL were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate a cutoff score for the German "Tinnitus Acceptance Questionnaire" (CTAQ-G) and to evaluate the screening abilities of the CTAQ-G. Independent sample t-tests were conducted to compare QoL and psychological distress in patients with low tinnitus acceptance and high tinnitus acceptance. A cutoff point for CTAQ-G of 62. 5 was defined, differentiating between patients with "low-to-mild tinnitus acceptance" and "moderate-to-high tinnitus acceptance. " Patients with higher levels of tinnitus <b>acceptance</b> <b>reported</b> a significantly higher QoL and lower psychological distress. Tinnitus acceptance plays an important role for patients with chronic tinnitus. Increased levels of acceptance are related to better QoL and less psychological distress...|$|R
40|$|Background: Using a Biocultural Model of Maturity-Associated Variance in {{physical}} activity (PA) as a conceptual framework, the main and interactive effects of biological maturity status and perceived peer acceptance on PA and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescent girls were examined. Methods: Three hundred forty-two female British students in years 7 to 9 (13. 2 ± 0. 83 years) participated in the study. All participants completed the PA Questionnaire for Adolescents and KIDSCREEN- 10, a measure of HRQoL. Self-reported perceptions of peer acceptance were measured by items from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Maturity status was estimated {{as the percentage of}} predicted adult (mature) height attained at the time of observation. Results: Analysis of covariance suggested an influence of peer acceptance on maturity-associated differences in PA, but not on HRQoL. Girls early and “on time” in maturation with higher perceptions of peer <b>acceptance</b> <b>reported</b> greater involvement in PA than girls early and “on time” in maturation with lower perceptions of peer acceptance. A reverse association was observed for late-maturing girls. Conclusions: Peer acceptance is an important moderator of maturity-associated variation in PA...|$|R
