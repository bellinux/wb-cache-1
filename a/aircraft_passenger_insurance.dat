40|$|Abstract. Travel by {{air with}} long hours will create {{discomfort}} feeling for <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> especially economy class <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger.</b> Long hour air travel will create physiological stress on <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger.</b> It may due to seat space limitation, noise, vibration, cabin humidity {{as well as}} seat comfort. Seat comfort is a subjective feeling that related to psychological aspect of <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger.</b> The current <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> seat {{is equipped with a}} passive function where the passenger themselves needs to adjust the seat for comfort seating position. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> will not able to adjust the seat when the <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> is in the low activity condition. The active seat support system was developed to support the <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> actively. The first prototype of active seat support system is focus on neck section. The head position of the aircraft seat was embedded with the system to detect the head position of the passenger. During the development of the active seat support system, total design technique was used. Five conceptual designs were generated for selection. To determine the final design of active neck support system, the matrix evaluation method was used. The weight of the concept was obtained through weight analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{economy class}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>passengers</b> who {{experience}} long hour sitting during air travel has experienced significant body discomfort at neck, shoulder, lower back, upper leg and lower leg. The questionnaire was {{set out to}} study the relationship between different body back part discomfort and travel time of economy class <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> in order to rank the discomfort level for each body back part. There were one hundred and four anonymous self administered surveys were completed at Schiphol International Airport, the Netherlands. In line with the survey hypothesis, findings confirmed that the body discomfort of <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> after five hours travel is higher than after one hour travel. The body discomfort of economy class <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> is associated with flight duration. Further studies concerning how to best provide comfort to long haul economy class <b>aircraft</b> <b>passengers</b> are needed. The survey {{presented in this paper}} will beneficial the <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> seat designers to facilitate future design and evaluate seats that able to reduce body discomfort during long haul air travel...|$|R

Long haul air travel may cause different physiological and psychological discomfort of <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger.</b> Most of the aircraft company treats the passenger comfort as a main priority for the user’s acceptance of their airline. In order to improve the <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> body comfort during long haul air travel, an adaptive body support system was developed and embedded in the economy class aircraft seat.

40|$|Air {{travel is}} {{becoming}} increasingly more accessible to people both through the availability of low cost flights. Health problems may arise due to anxiety and unfamiliarity with airport departure procedures prior to flying, whilst during the air travel, problems may arise {{as a result of}} the food served on board, differences in the environmental conditions inside the cabin, the risk of crossinfection from fellow passengers, seat position, posture adopted and duration of the flight. These can be further compounded by changes in time zones and meal times, which may continue to affect an individual’s health long after arrival at the final destination. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>passenger</b> comfort depends on different features and the environment during air travel.
