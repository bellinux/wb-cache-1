40|$|We {{construct}} an empirical model for daily highs <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> of US stock indexes {{based on the}} intuition that highs <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> do not drift apart over time. Our empirical results show that daily highs <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in highs <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 – 50 % of variations in daily highs <b>and</b> <b>lows.</b> The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily highs <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.
