40|$|This {{paper by}} Aoki, Benigno, and Kiyotaki (ABK) {{provides}} a useful sequel to their influential 2006 paper. Both papers rest on the observation that upon capital account liberalization countries experience large swings both {{in the value of}} fixed assets and in the available amounts of foreign and domestic credits. The authors argue that although these changes are observed both by industrial and emerging market countries they are ignored by the standard models. In particular, {{the authors would like to}} know how does the adjustment to capital account liberalization depend on the degree of development of domestic financial institutions and why the economies with underdeveloped financial systems are more vulnerable to these foreign and domestic credit shocks? To answer these questions, they develop a model of small open economy, where it is difficult to enforce debtors to repay their debt unless it is secured by a collateral. The fixed asset (land) acts as collateral and the borrower’s credit limit is affected by the price of the fixed asset and vice versa. The interaction between credit limits and the asset prices turns out to be a propagation mechanism, which may generate large swings in <b>aggregate</b> <b>economics</b> activities. The main result of both ABK (2006) and ABK (2007) is as follows. Capital account liberalization cause temporary recessions, but liberalization ca...|$|E

Adoption of free trade shifts the economic incidence of pollution tax from consumers onto producers of the polluting good. Under fairly plausible conditions, this change in incidence can reduce the distortion in pollution tax. Even though the choice of accession is influenced by special interest groups, I find that accession can be accompanied by an improvement in pollution policy {{and an increase in}} <b>aggregate</b> welfare.

40|$|The paper {{conducts a}} {{comparative}} study of the monetary policy transmission in two economies that run a well-established IT regime, Chile and New Zealand, vis-Ã -vis two economies operating under relatively newer IT regimes, and which are exposed to a significant degree of dollarization, Peru and Uruguay. It is shown that the traditional interest rate channel is effective in Chile and New Zealand. For Peru and Uruguay, the exchange rate channel is instead more relevant in the transmission of monetary policy. This latter result follows from the limited impact of the policy rate in curbing inflationary pressures in these two countries, {{in combination with the}} fact that they have a relatively large and persistent exchange rate pass through. Finally, it is shown that the on-going de-dollarization process of Peru and Uruguay has somewhat strengthened their monetary transmission through the interest rate channel.

It presents an intertemporal two-sector model with a cash-in-advance constraint. In this setting, inflation reduces real wages through (1) a decline of the capital stock, and (2) a shift in relative prices. The two effects are additive and make the decline in real wages exceed the decline in per-capita GDP. This mechanism may contribute to rising poverty during periods of high inflation.

We then apply a synthetic asymmetric error correction model that distinguishes short-run and long-run asymmetries and helps reconcile the conflicting results from the previous literature.

40|$|Is {{aggressive}} {{monetary policy}} response to inflation feasible {{in countries that}} suffer from fiscal dominance? We find that if nominal interest rates are allowed to respond to government debt, even aggressive rules that satisfy the Taylor principle can produce unique equilibria. However, resulting inflation is extremely volatile and zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is frequently violated. Within the set of feasible rules the optimal response to inflation is highly negative, and more aggressive inflation fighting is inferior from a welfare point of view. The welfare gain from responding to fiscal variables is minimal compared to the gain from eliminating fiscal dominance.

The approach to the main topic starts with the construction of a theoretical matrix of the economics of the firm, opening with the two major traditions of institutionalist thought in economics, and evolving then towards some considerations around the contractual and the evolutionary approaches. Another important theoretical stream that deals with organizations in economic and sociological terms also appears, the population ecology approach. After this overview, it is developed a cross-exam of distinct theoretical perspectives and the identification of possible flaws of the neoclassical theory.

Theoretical examples are easily constructed which contradict the fundamental neoclassical hypothesis of an inverse relationship between the rate of profit and the intensity of capital, differentiating between aggregate and sectoral intensity. This paper for the first time presents empirical examples. To this end, the quantity system of the von Neumann model is here used to model spectra of techniques. 32 input-output tables from 9 countries of the OECD input-output data base serve as data.
