5|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the term}} Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than other varieties. This name's appearance, 40 years after the first documented {{use of the}} term Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery <b>of</b> the <b>vine's</b> Croatian <b>origin.</b>|$|R

The map of the potential production site for vineyards that was developed and maintained by the Viticultural and Enological Research Institute (SZBKI) on analogue maps showing the production site suitability for vineyards. These maps were created by onsite observation, but at that time the available maps and technology did not provide enough accuracy to demonstrate the research and the know-how. Now by the help of the GIS technology available in the VINGIS the update of this maps become easier and more efficient. At the same time new research opportunities become possible (e. g. : protection <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> with designated <b>origin).</b> Proceeding...|$|R
50|$|It is {{primarily}} known for good tolerance against soils {{with a high}} content of lime, which can cause chlorosis in many <b>vines</b> <b>of</b> American <b>origin.</b> Lime is a characteristic of the soils of many classical French wine regions and highly regarded vineyard sites, and many Vitis vinifera cultivars were well suited to these growing conditions. When American vines were imported to Europe as rootstocks for grafting V. vinifera on, {{in the wake of}} the Great French wine blight, it initially proved difficult to find vine species that would grow well in lime-rich soil. V. berlandieri, which had adapted to limestone hills in central Texas, provided the lime tolerance needed to solve this problem. However, V. berlandieri itself is poorly adapted to grafting. Therefore, various rootstocks resistant against both phylloxera and lime, and suitable for viticulture, were produced by crossing V. berlandieri and Vitis riparia, Vitis rupestris or V. vinifera.|$|R
50|$|The growing {{of grapes}} in the {{municipality}} began with wine grapes {{in the early}} 1960s and has grown {{to be one of}} the most important agricultural products, featured on Tequisquiapan’s municipal seal. Reds, whites and rosés are produced but most are sparkling wines. The major producer in the municipality is Viñedos La Redonda, about twelve km outside of the town proper. The vineyards are mostly planted with <b>vines</b> <b>of</b> French <b>origin</b> such as Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec for reds and Chenin blanc and Trebbiano for whites. It has guided tours for visitors, especially at harvest time. One major producer of table grapes is Rancho San Miguel. The ranch extends over forty hectares and primarily produces Red Globe and Ribier Negra grapes. The ranch also raises 1,200 sheep which helps the ranch maintain an ecological balance through the production of fertilizer. The ranch produces 3,200 crates of the fruit daily during harvest.|$|R
40|$|Mile-A-Minute (MAM) weed, Polygonum perfoliatum L. (Polygonaceae), is an annu-al or {{perennial}} <b>vine</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>origin,</b> {{which has}} become a serious weed in the eastern U. S. The weed grows and spreads rapidly out competing and replacing native plants in many habitats. In 1996, a collaborative biological control program was started with the search for natural enemies of the weed in China. During the past three years about 80 insect species from 6 orders and 20 families were collected and identified, although some imma-tures still remained unidentified. The survey covered ten provinces including Jilin, Inner-Mongolia, Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin in Northern China, and Henan, Shandong in central China as well as Fujian, Zhejiang {{in the southern part of}} the country. Most of the insects were collected from leaves, but stem-borers, gall-makers, flower- and seed-feed-ers were also found. Based on information from the literature and results from laboratory tests and field surveys on their host range, severity of damage and field populations, three species were regarded as potential biocontrol agents against the weed. They are a geometrid moth, Timandra griseata Peterson, a weevil, Homorosoma chinensis (Wagner) and a bug, Cletus schmidti Kiritschulsko...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Postveraison {{limitation}} of canopy photosynthesis delays grape berry ripening and reduces sugar accumulation, thus lowering the <b>alcohol</b> content <b>of</b> the subsequent wines. This {{study was designed}} to evaluate whether similar results could be obtained by defoliation apical to the bunch zone using a leaf-plucking machine when berry sugar content was approximately 16 - 17 °Brix. Methods and Results: In 2011 and 2012, defoliation treatments were applied postveraison to cv. Sangiovese vines (D) on either side of each row using a mechanical leaf remover, and these D vines were compared to a nondefoliated control (C). The machine removed 35 % of the leaves on the vine and created a 50 -cm vertical window without leaves above the bunch area, but retained a few leaves at the canopy apex (about 0. 50 m 2 /vine). In both years, leaf removal reduced the rate of berry sugar accumulation and led to a 1. 2 lower harvest °Brix and consequently, a lower wine alcohol (- 0. 6 %) content in D relative to that <b>of</b> C <b>vines.</b> In 2012, sugar content <b>of</b> D <b>vines,</b> monitored in a group <b>of</b> <b>vines</b> that was not harvested, had recovered to that <b>of</b> C <b>vines</b> 2 weeks after harvest. The concentration of total phenolic compounds in the grapes, the chemical and chromatic characteristics of the wines and the replenishment of soluble sugars, starch and total nitrogen in the canes and roots were similar in the D and C vines. Conclusion: To achieve an effective delay in sugar accumulation in the berries, leaves should be removed at 16 - 17 °Brix, and at least 30 - 35 % <b>of</b> <b>vine</b> leaf area should be removed. Significance of the Study: Mechanical removal of leaves postveraison above the bunch zone of Sangiovese can be an easy and economically viable technique for delaying sugar accumulation in the berries and for limiting the <b>alcohol</b> content <b>of</b> wines with no negative impact on desirable composition of either berries or wines...|$|R
