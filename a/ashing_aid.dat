40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the ability}} of treated oil palm <b>ash</b> <b>aided</b> with kaolin powder to produce zeolites is studied. The use of treated oil palm ash in the zeolites {{conversion}} {{seems to be an}} option for waste materials management. Characterization of treated oil palm ash from Malaysia’s palm oil plantation has been acquitted. The treated oil palm ash and kaolin powder are used as the starting material for the synthesis of zeolites materials. The method chose for the zeolites conversion is alkaline hydrothermal treatment. The chemical composition, crystalline phases and elemental composition of treated oil palm ash and as-synthesized samples were characterized and studied. From the analysis, the treated oil palm ash was a fertile source of silica and exists as quartz phase. The outcomes have significant motivation for the production of zeolites by using low cost material such as treated oil palm ash...|$|R

60|$|She found Laura {{waiting for}} her, {{and a few}} minutes {{afterwards}} the two girls were examining the <b>ashes</b> with the <b>aid</b> of Quest's microscope. Among the little pile was one fragment at the sight of which they both exclaimed. It was distinctly a shred of charred muslin embroidery. Lenora pointed towards it triumphantly.|$|R
40|$|Between {{the villages}} of Rocker and Silver Bow, in south­western Montana, are found an {{interesting}} group of placers. Gold occurs in Tertiary gravel beds that are interstratified with beds of rhyolitic volcanic <b>ash.</b> With the <b>aid</b> of a plane table and open-sight alidade, {{a small portion of}} the lake-bed area near Rocker was mapped; all distances were paced, but numerous checks assure a fairly accurate map...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 73 % of the country’s total {{installed}} power generation capacity is thermal of which coal-based generation is 90 %. Some 85 thermal power stations, besides several captive power plants use bituminous and sub-bituminous coal and produce {{large quantities of}} fly ash. High ash content (30 % - 50 %) coal contributes to these large volumes of fly ash. The country’s dependence on coal for power generation has unchanged. Thus fly ash management is a cause {{of concern for the}} future. The purpose of this project is to find a suitable utilization for a particular fly ash sample depending upon its geotechnical properties and thus reduce the need for vast areas for disposal of fly ash which in turn causes considerable damage to the environment. In this project various geotechnical experiments are performed on fly ash samples. Some of them are Standard Procter Compaction test, Liquid limit test, Permeability study, Unconfined compressive strength study etc. Based on the results obtained from these experiments, a suitable end use for the fly ash based on the characteristics of the sample is ascertained. The results from the geotechnical experiments help in determining the potential of the fly ash for use, in highway embankments, in construction of bricks, as an aggregate material in Portland cement, filling of low lying areas etc. From the results obtained {{it was found that the}} fly ash can be compacted over a large moisture content range thus it has a potential to be used in fills and embankments. Also since fly ash is having low permeability thus it further benefits the use in fills and embankments by reducing the chances of damage to the ground water resources. The low specific gravity of fly and the pozzolanic activity of fly <b>ash</b> <b>aids</b> for its use along-with cements for construction purposes and also in manufacturing of bricks...|$|R
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of <b>ash</b> and to <b>aid</b> clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|R
5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of <b>ash</b> and to <b>aid</b> clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|R
40|$|Coal {{extraction}} {{experiments were}} conducted using a coal, containing ca. 10 % ash, from the Tshikondeni mine in South Africa. This coal dissolves {{only to a}} limited extent in pure polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidinone (NMP). However, {{the addition of a}} strong base, e. g. sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sodium tert-butoxide increased the degree of coal dissolution in these organic solvents. Depending on the extraction conditions, carbon extraction efficiencies of up to 90 % were obtained. Carbon precursor material was recovered from the solution as a gel by precipitation with water. Ash content was reduced from 10 % in the coal to less than 1. 6 % in the coal extracts. Sodium sulfide (Na 2 S) addition further reduced <b>ash</b> content and <b>aided</b> the recovery of carbon precursors that led to graphitizable cokes but the degree of extraction was significantly reduced...|$|R
5000|$|The cloths are woven on {{a narrow}} back-strap looms. The cotton is hand-spun. Before dying the threads are soaked in a bath of kemiri, candle nut oil, and wood <b>ash</b> to <b>aid</b> the take-up of the red dye, then hung up to dry in the sun. Ramseyer said that the yarn was left to soak for 42 days and then left to dry for the same time. Gillow states that this is {{repeated}} up to 12 times. The threads are wrapped around the dying frame and the pattern is tied into the bundles of thread to form a resist. The bound warp and weft threads are then sent out to the neighboring village of Bug-Bug to be dyed as indigo is forbidden {{to be used in}} Tenganan. [...] Once dyed indigo, the threads are put back on the frames and some of the ties are undone to allow the red component of the pattern to be developed. The indigo is also over-dyed by the red to give the characteristic dark rust-brown color. The warp is then laid out on the loom and the cloth is woven in a loose balanced weave. The pattern is carried by both the warp and the weft. Great precision is needed at all stages of the production. Using a pick the weaver adjust the weft with each pass of the shuttle to make sure the alignment of the pattern is precise.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the series, Ash's primary {{enemies are}} a Pokémon crime {{organization}} called Team Rocket, specifically the two comical and bumbling members, Jessie and James, and their talking Meowth, who {{is essentially the}} third member of the group. Ever since being defeated by Ash's Pikachu in the second episode, [...] "Pokémon Emergency!", {{the three of them}} have obsessively never stopped chasing after them to steal Ash's Pikachu, maintaining the delusion that Pikachu is abnormally powerful and presenting it to their criminal boss would make them very rich. As the enduring comical villains of the series, the Team Rocket trio occasionally show signs of goodness, such as care and friendship with their Pokémon and each other, and despite their constant antagonism, they occasionally put their differences aside and work together with Ash against a common threat, such as in Pokémon: The Movie 2000, where they <b>aid</b> <b>Ash</b> in retrieving the three treasures in order to save the world.|$|R
25|$|Bruno Bettelheim {{notes in}} The Uses of Enchantment that the 18th-century fairy tale Beauty and the Beast is {{a version of}} Cupid and Psyche. Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, {{including}} Cinderella and Rumpelstiltskin, in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from <b>ash,</b> and is <b>aided</b> by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, {{in an attempt to}} end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{animated}} series, Ash Ketchum, Brock, and Misty encounter {{a gang of}} five Squirtle known as the Squirtle Squad in his debut episode [...] "Here Comes the Squirtle Squad!". They first appear as delinquents, but their interactions with Ash and Co. result in them becoming honorary firefighters of their town. The leader of the gang, however, chooses to go with Ash and battle for him; throughout Ash's journey through the Kanto region, it is an invaluable member of Ash's team, and proves its strength without ever evolving. Eventually, the Squirtle parts ways with Ash in order to lead its old gang, who were suffering a lack of proper guidance. Despite returning to its hometown, Squirtle will happily <b>aid</b> <b>Ash</b> whenever he requests it.Whenever Squirtle appears he puts {{on a pair of}} black pointed sunglasses. Some think he does this because his Pokédex number is 007 which relates to the movie James Bond. Ash's second female companion, May received her own Squirtle from Professor Oak. May's Squirtle was very young and timid until evolving, despite being recently born, it quickly grows accustomed to the Pokémon Contests May participates in, even helping May win some, earning Ribbons as rewards. After May leaves Ash's group, she temporarily reunites with him in Sinnoh, revealing that many of her Pokémon had now evolved; Squirtle has since evolved into Wartortle. Eric Stuart does the voice of Squirtle up until late in Ash's Hoenn adventure; Michelle Knotz takes over his role afterwards.|$|R
