50|$|An {{anxiolytic}} (also <b>antipanic</b> or antianxiety agent) is {{the medication}} or other intervention that inhibits anxiety.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies {{suggest an}} {{association}} between panic disorder (PD) and impairment of lung function. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate lung function in 11 asymptomatic PD patients and to investigate <b>antipanic</b> drug effects on respiratory function. METHOD: Lung function was evaluated on two different occasions (with <b>antipanic</b> drugs and after drug washout). It was comprised of a spirometric evaluation and a bronchodilation test (salbutamol inhalation). Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale (SUDS) was applied before and after each spirometric assessment. RESULTS: One patient showed mild obstructive airway impairment. Before bronchodilation test forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) and forced expiratory flow between 25 % and 75 % of the forced vital capacity (FEF 25 - 75) were significantly higher in patients on <b>antipanic</b> drugs than in those in the washout period. After salbutamol inhalation, only FEV 1 was significantly higher in patients with <b>antipanic</b> drugs {{in comparison to the}} other group, whereas a significant increase in FEV 1 and FEF 25 - 75 after salbutamol inhalation was detected in patients without <b>antipanic</b> drugs. The subjective anxiety level was not different among PD patients in both test days. DISCUSSION: These results suggest a possible beneficial effect of the <b>antipanic</b> drug on lung function in PD patients...|$|E
40|$|With {{the use of}} the shock-induced {{suppression}} of water drinking in thirsty rats (Vogel's conflict paradigm) and the pentylenetetrazole-enhanced shock-induced {{suppression of}} drinking (proconflict paradigm) as animal models to test anxiolytic and <b>antipanic</b> agents, it was possible to distinguish two major classes of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and congeners {{on the basis of their}} antiproconflict index (ratio of anticonflict/antiproconflict potencies). Thus, typical low potency BZDs and congeners (diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, alpidem) with anxiolytic/hypnotic properties have a low antiproconflict index (close to 1), whereas typical high potency BZDs (clonazepam, alprazolam, bretazenil) with reported <b>antipanic</b> properties have an antiproconflict index approximately 10 -fold higher. The anticonflict and antiproconflict actions of BZDs with low or high antiproconflict indices are blocked by flumazenil but are potentiated differentially by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake blocker 1 - 2 -[bis(trifluoromethyl) -phenyl]-methoxyethyl- 1, 2, 5, 6 -tetrahydro- 3 - pyridine-carboxylic acid. Protracted administration of antianxiety and <b>antipanic</b> antidepressant drugs that do not act on GABAA receptors, directly, resulted in anticonflict and antiproconflict effects. However, the efficacy of these drugs is clearly inferior (20 - 30 %) to that of BZDs. These data suggest that specific GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the pharmacological action of BZDs possessing low and high antiproconflict indices...|$|E
40|$|The ideal {{properties}} for an <b>antipanic</b> agent include {{the ability to}} provide complete recovery from panic attacks, resolution of associated anxiety and avoidance behavior, relapse prevention, good tolerability, and efficacy in comorbid conditions including depression.

Experimental approaches {{in the development of}} therapeutic agents of potential use against panic disorder were also examined. It is clear that SSRIs, such as paroxetine, are an effective treatment for panic disorder, and their antidepressant activity also allows concurrent treatment of comorbid depressive disorders, for which patients with panic disorder are at high risk.

40|$|Rationale Serotonin in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) {{through the}} {{activation}} of 5 -HT(1 A) and 5 -HT(2 A) receptors inhibits escape, a defensive behavior associated with panic attacks. Long-term treatment with <b>antipanic</b> drugs that nonselectively or selectively blocks the reuptake of serotonin (e. g., imipramine and fluoxetine, respectively) enhances the inhibitory effect on escape caused by intra-DPAG injection of 5 -HT(1 A) and 5 -HT(2 A) receptor agonists. It {{has been proposed}} that these compounds exert their effect on panic by facilitating 5 -HT-mediated neurotransmission in the DPAG. Objectives The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether facilitation of 5 -HT neurotransmission in the DPAG is also observed after treatment with alprazolam, a pharmacologically distinct <b>antipanic</b> drug that acts primarily as a high potency benzodiazepine receptor agonist. Materials and methods Male Wistar rats, subchronically (3 - 6 days) or chronically (14 - 17 days) treated with alprazolam (2 and 4 mg/kg, i. p.) were intra-DPAG injected with (+/-) - 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8 -OH-DPAT), (+/-) - 1 -(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -iodophenyl) piperazine dihydrochloride (DOI), and midazolam, respectively, 5 -HT(1 A), 5 -HT(2 A/ 2 C), and benzodiazepine receptor agonists. The intensity of electrical current that needed to be applied to the DPAG to evoke escape behavior was measured before and after the microinjection of these agonists. Results Intra-DPAG injection of the 5 -HT agonists and midazolam increased the escape threshold in all groups of animals tested, indicating a panicolytic-like effect. The inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT and DOI, but not midazolam, was significantly higher in animals receiving long-, but not short-term treatment with alprazolam. Conclusions Alprazolam as antidepressants compounds facilitates 5 -HT(1 A) - and 5 -HT(2 A) -receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the DPAG, implicating this effect in the mode of action of different classes of <b>antipanic</b> drugs...|$|E

40|$|Regular {{physical}} activity is anxiolytic for both healthy subjects and patients with panic disorder. However, the acute <b>antipanic</b> {{effect of a}} single bout of exercise {{has not yet been}} studied systematically. In this study, the effect of quiet rest or aerobic treadmill exercise (30 minutes at 70 % of the individual maximum oxygen consumption) on experimentally induced panic attacks were investigated in a crossover design in fifteen healthy subjests. Panic attacks were induced using Cholecystokinin Tetrapetide (CCK- 4), a substance that is particularly suitable for the dose-dependent induction of panic attacks in both patients with panic disorder and healthy subjects. The effects were measured with the Acute Panic Inventory, a questionnaire for assessing the specific symptoms of panic attacks. Panic attacks occured in twelve subjects after rest but in only six subjects after exercise. In both conditions, CCK- 4 administration was followed by a significant increase in Acute Panic Inventory scores. However, prior exercise resulted in significantly lower scores than quiet rest. Subscore analysis of the Acute Panic Inventory scores indicated that exercise decreased CCK- 4 -induced anxiety symptoms more than somatic symptoms. Additionally, the subjective experience of CCK- 4 -induced symptoms decreased after exercise in most subjects. Possible explanations for the acute <b>antipanic</b> activity of aerobic exercise are discussed.

40|$|Imidazenil is {{a highly}} potent partial {{allosteric}} modulator of y-aminobutyric acid action at {{a great variety of}} y-aminobutyric acidA receptors, whereas alprazolam is a full allosteric modu-lator at these receptors.

40|$|Alprazolam is a triazolo analog of the 1, 4 {{benzodiazepine}} class, {{widely used}} to treat patients with anxiety disorder, panic attacks and anxiety comorbidity with depressive disorder.

The main metabolic route is hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P 450 3 A: alpha-hydroxy alprazolam is partially active. Alprazolam possesses anxiolytic properties similar to other benzodiazepines; however, the triazolo ring confers to alprazolam a peculiar antidepressant and <b>antipanic</b> activity.

40|$|A {{role for}} second-generation {{antipsychotics}} (SGAs) {{in the treatment}} of panic disorders (PD) has been proposed, but the actual usefulness of SGAs in this disorder is unclear. According to the PRISMA guidelines, we undertook an updated systematic review of all of the studies that have examined, in randomized controlled trials, the efficacy and tolerability of SGAs (as either monotherapy or augmentation) {{in the treatment of}} PD, with or without other comorbid psychiatric disorders.

Among 210 studies, five were included (two involving patients with a principal diagnosis of PD and three involving patients with bipolar disorder with comorbid PD or generalized anxiety disorder). All were eight-week trials and involved treatments with quetiapine extended release, risperidone and ziprasidone. Overall, a general lack of efficacy of SGAs on panic symptoms was observed. Some preliminary indications of the <b>antipanic</b> effectiveness of risperidone are insufficient to support its use in PD, primarily due to major limitations of the study. However, several methodological limitations may have negatively affected all of these studies, decreasing the validity of the results and making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.

40|$|Different data {{indicate}} that psychological and/or emotional disorders may {{play an important role}} in the natural history of heart diseases. Although the major evidence is that related to depression, epidemiological data would indicate that anxiety and panic disorders are highly represented in cardiac patient, thus influencing mortality and morbidity. The diagnosis of panic disorder in patients with chest pain is crucial to a correct therapeutic approach, as well as to reduce the risks and costs of inappropriate treatments. Anxiety and panic may accelerate different direct and indirect processes involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases: lifestyle risk factors, arterial hypertension, myocardial perfusion, autonomic nervous system or hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, platelet activation, and inflammation processes. Panic disorder seems to correlate particularly with sudden death: this suggests that it may be considered one of the main inducers of life-threatening arrhythmias, rather than to be linked to the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Beyond hard outcomes, panic disorders produce negative effects on both global adjustment and life quality that may impair the course of the cardiac diseases. Interestingly, specific <b>antipanic</b> and anxiolytic agents seem to be particularly effective upon life quality.

40|$|Sertraline is a {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitor {{used as an}} antidepressant and <b>antipanic</b> agent in children and adolescents. Sertraline is well tolerated and its safety profile in overdose is favorable. However, sertraline overdose may cause a toxic hyperserotonergic state known as serotonin syndrome (SS). Serotonin syndrome may be misdiagnosed in children {{because it has been}} reported mostly in adults. In the present case report, we describe a 16 -year-old female patient who ingested 2000 mg of sertraline to attempt suicide. The patient showed symptoms and signs suggestive of SS, characterized by an asynchronicity between organic and psychiatric symptoms. In addition, the patient showed a variability of psychiatric symptoms through time. Thirteen hours after sertraline overdose, she was poorly cooperative with poverty of speech and marked emotional tension, but she was oriented in space and time and was able to remember what happened to her and to reconstruct the dynamics of the fact. Twenty-four hours after sertraline overdose, the patient developed a delusion of reference associated with intense anxiety and depressed mood.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} naturalistic {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} duration of untreated illness (DUI) on the outcome and treatment response of panic disorder (PD). Methods: Ninety-six outpatients with PD who underwent an 8 -week open-label treatment with serotonergic antidepressants were subdivided into two subgroups: those with DUI ≤ 1 year and those with DUI> 1 year. The main baseline demographic and clinical variables were calculated and compared between the two subgroups of patients (chi-square test or t-test for independent samples). The effect of the <b>antipanic</b> medication was evaluated by analysis of variance with repeated measures considering Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Clinical Global Impression rating scores, and the number of panic attacks/week as the dependent variables (outcome measures), while the subgroups were the independent ones. Comorbidity with onset later than PD was also considered. Results: There were no differences between patients with DUI ≤ 1 year and patients with DUI> 1 year with respect to the outcome measures considered. However, patients with DUI> 1 year (N = 64) had a higher frequency of comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD) with onset later than PD (p = 0. 006). Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that the DUI may be a predictor of the development of comorbid MDD in PD.

40|$|Background: In {{contrast}} with many studies describing the usual care for major {{depression in the}} pri-mary care setting, there are few data on treatment received by primary care patients with panic disorder. Methods: This prospective cohort study describes the self-reported medication use, at 3 -month inter-vals for 1 year, of 58 patients with panic disorder and predictors {{of the use of}} appropriate (type, dose, and duration) medication. Results: Approximately one half the patients received some type of <b>antipanic</b> medication at each in-terval, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) the most common. Pharmacy records indi-cate that about 40 % of patients not taking medication had received an initial physician prescription. Adequacy of dose and duration was achieved in only two thirds of the medication trials, usually with an SSRI. Patient characteristics (agoraphobia and low neuroticism) but not physician characteristics (eg, specialty, level of training, or years in practice) predicted those patients who had an adequate trial dur-ing at least one time interval. The relation between adequacy of medication and outcome was minimal. Conclusion: These findings highlight the continued undertreatment of panic disorder in primary care but suggest that focused efforts at physician education about diagnosis and treatment are less likely to increase rates of treatment compared with efforts to educate patients and improve the care process wit...|$|E
40|$|A {{large and}} {{divergent}} literature {{has emerged from}} the growing body of neurobiological research on panic disorder (PD). There have been few reviews of this literature, particularly in recent years. The present paper reviews the neurobiology of PD {{in the areas of}} genetic/familial transmission of PD, brain imaging studies, hyperventilation and· carbon dioxide inhalation, and studies of panic provoked by chemical means in the laboratory. Review of the literature suggests a widely held consensus among investigators that a neurobiological vulnerability to PD may be passed across generations, but there is no firm consensus regarding the site and specific nature of this presumed vulnerability. A noradrenergic dysregulation that implicates the locus ceruleus region of the brain remains a dominant model. Increasing interest 1 n the role of neuroreceptors in PD has been brought about by the effectiveness of <b>antipanic</b> medications that seem to operate on these sites, as well as the development of methodology to provoke panic in the laboratory. A recent trend to evaluate the role of cognitive factors in the onset and maintenance of panic has led to efforts to incorporate psychological factors in both research designs and models of dysfunction in PD. These trends evident from the review of the literature of the neurobiology of PD are viewed in a historical context of development of interest in PD, as well as recent studies of the surprisingly high prevalence and morbidity of the phenomenon known as panic...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that alpha 1 -containing GABA(A) receptors mediate the sedative, amnestic, {{and to some extent}} the anticonvulsant actions of non-selective benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands, such as diazepam (DZ). Anxiolytic and in part, anticonvulsant actions of BZ ligands are mediated by alpha 2 -, alpha 3 -, and alpha 5 -containing GABA(A) receptors. This has resulted in increasing interest in developing BZ ligands with selective actions at GABA(A) receptors, including alpha 2 -, alpha 3 -, and alpha 5 -subunits, but devoid of efficacy at alpha 1 -containing receptors. To refine their spectrum of pharmacological actions, efforts are being made to minimize unwanted effects such as sedation, amnesia, and tolerance liabilities. A prototype for such BZ ligands is imidazenil (IMD), an imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivative that elicits potent anticonvulsant and anxiolytic actions at doses virtually devoid of sedative, cardio-respiratory depressant and amnestic effects, and anticonvulsant tolerance liability. To define the pharmacological profile of IMD and its derivatives, we compared the anticonflict (anxiolytic), anti-proconflict (<b>antipanic),</b> anti-bicuculline (BIC), and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) effects, and the suppression of locomotor activity by imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivatives to those of DZ and bretazenil (BTZ). We report here that IMD and one of its derivatives (RO 25 - 2775) possess dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, and anti-BIC actions but failed to suppress locomotor activity. Like DZ, the other IMD derivatives (enazenil, RO 25 - 2776, and RO 25 - 2847) not only elicit dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, anti-BIC, anti-MES effects but also suppress locomotor activity. In contrast, none of the IMD derivatives studied shows any similarity to BTZ, which elicits anticonflict, anti-proconflict actions and suppresses locomotor activity but is virtually inactive against BIC-induced tonic-clonic convulsions...|$|E

Regular physical activity is anxiolytic in healthy subjects and patients with panic disorder. In contrast, acute exercise may induce acute panic attacks or increase subjective anxiety in patients with panic disorder more than in other people. The effects of quiet rest or an aerobic treadmill exercise on cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) induced panic attacks were studied in a crossover design in 12 patients with panic disorder and 12 matched healthy subjects. The effects of CCK- 4 were measured with the Acute Panic Inventory (API) score, comparing panic attack frequencies, total score, and subscores for anxiety and somatic symptoms. CCK- 4 -induced panic attacks were less frequent after prior exercise. In both conditions, CCK- 4 administration induced {{a significant increase in the}} total API score and the anxiety and somatic symptoms subsores. However, compared to prior rest, exercise resulted in a significantly reduced CCK- 4 -induced increase of the total API score and the anxiety subscore. In patients with panic disorder exercise increased the total API score and the somatic symptoms subscale but not the anxiety subscore. Patients with panic disorder showed increased somatic but not anxiety symptoms after an acute bout of exercise. Severity of CCK- 4 -induced panic and anxiety, on the other hand was reduced by exercise. In summary, these findings give further evidence for an acute <b>antipanic</b> activity of exercise and suggest that besides exercise training a single exercise bout may be also used in the treatment of panic disorder...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{correlates}} of therapeutic response {{of patients with}} panic disor-der presenting with palpitations, we hypothesized that therapeutic response would correlate with heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep measures. Methods: After a 1 -week placebo washout, 27 patients free of structural heart disease and not on cardioactive drugs were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to 4 weeks of treat-ment with clonazepam (a known <b>antipanic</b> agent) or placebo. We performed standard sleep measures and recorded HRV from 24 -hour Holter acquisitions at baseline and end of study. We defined response to therapy as a 50 % improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) score, confirmed by questionnaires and reaction to sodium lactate infusion. Results: There were 12 responders and 15 nonresponders. Normalization of sleep pattern (including less stage 1 and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) was observed in both drug and placebo responders (P = 0. 011 and P = 0. 05, respectively) and in placebo responders alone, compared with nonresponders (P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 013, respectively). Placebo re-sponders {{were more likely to}} show less depression, but even after we controlled for depres-sion, main sleep effects remained. None of the HRV measures correlated with response, but compared with placebo, clonazepam led to a decrease in all the time and frequency do-main measures of HRV (all P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Central mechanisms are related to the therapeutic response of patients with panic disorder presenting with palpitations, but this does not directly correlate with HRV. Larger and longer studies may allow objective explanations of placebo response in panic disorder.

40|$|In {{addition}} to possessing anti-anxiety activity in man, triazolobenzodiazepines {{have been reported}} to have antidepressant and <b>antipanic</b> properties. In this they differ from classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines that have only anti-anxiety activity. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the effects of the triazolobenzodiazepines in two animal tests of anxiety and in the holeboard, to see whether clear differences could be observed between them and the 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. After acute administration, U- 43, 465 (16 mg kg- 1) had a significant anxiolytic effect in the social interaction test. Neither adinazolam (1 - 3. 5 mg kg- 1) nor alprazolam (0. 125 - 2 mg kg- 1) had a significant effect. It is suggested that this is because, with adinazolam and alprazolam, doses at which anxiolytic effects can be observed are close to those at which sedative effects can be observed. U- 43, 465 (8 - 16 mg kg- 1) and alprazolam (1 - 2 mg kg- 1) had significant anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. U- 43, 465 (8 - 32 mg kg- 1), adinazolam (0. 5 - 5 mg kg- 1) and alprazolam (0. 2 - 2. 0 mg kg- 1) caused dose-related reductions in exploratory head-dipping, locomotor activity and rearing in the holeboard. In general the results seen in the three tests with the triazolobenzodiazepines alprazolam and adinazolam were similar to those seen with classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. With U- 43, 465, however, an anxiolytic effect was observed in the social interaction test after acute treatment; chronic treatment is required to see an effect with classical 1, 4 -benzodiazepines. In this U- 43, 465 resembles the effects of several novel non-benzodiazepine putative anxiolytic compounds that are believed to have less sedative potential than the benzodiazepines...|$|E
40|$|Panic {{disorder}} and premenstrual dysphoria {{are accompanied by}} intriguing abnormalities related to the control of respiration, including enhanced responsiveness to CO 2 and enhanced respiratory variability. These aberrations {{do not seem to}} be shared by other psychiatric disorders, but appear to be relatively unique for panic {{disorder and}} premenstrual dysphoria. To elucidate why these patients display these aberrations in breathing hence might lead to an increased understanding of the nature of these conditions. The main purpose of the studies presented in this thesis was to increase our knowledge regarding the regulation of breathing in rat, with particular reference to aspects that might shed light on the respiratory abnormalities associated with panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoria. To this end, the effects on respiration of compounds known to elicit anxiety attacks in patients with panic disorder or premenstrual dysphoria were studied, as were those of serotonin reuptake inhibition - the most effective pharmacological principle for the treatment of panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoria - and serotonin depletion, respectively. Prompted by reports suggesting that angiotensin II may influence both respiration and anxiety, we also investigated the possible role of this transmitter in the regulation of respiratory variability in rat, as well as the possible association between a number of angiotensin-related genes and panic disorder in humans. Given the key role of sex steroids for the pathophysiology of premenstrual dysphoria, and the likely involvement of sex steroids also in panic disorder, studies regarding the influence of estrus cyclicity on respiration in rat were included as well. Observations: 1) Sodium lactate in concentrations known to elicit panic attacks in panic disorder was found to stimulate respiration in rat. 2) This lactate-induced hyperventilation was found to be estrus cycle-related; female rats hence displayed enhanced response in diestrus, i. e. the phase roughly corresponding to the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, than in proestrus/estrus. 3) Serotonin depletion decreased respiratory rate and increased respiratory variability while treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine, increased respiratory rate and - after long-term treatment - lowered CO 2 sensitivity. 4) Rats displaying cycle-related variations in aggression, in a tentative animal model of premenstrual dysphoria, were found also to display cycle-related variations in respiration and an increased respiratory variability as compared to non-aggressive controls. 5) Like the respiratory response to sodium lactate, also CO 2 sensitivity was found to be estrus cycle-related; female rats displaying enhanced response in diestrus. 6) Central antagonism of angiotensin II-receptors was found to reduce respiratory variability in rat. 7) Panic disorder in men was found to be associated with the I/D polymorphism in the ACE gene. Conclusions: Our findings lend support to the theory of Donald F Klein that chemoreceptor activation might be a key component of spontaneous as well as provoked panic attacks. The observation that both sodium lactate-induced and CO 2 -induced hyperventilation were estrus cycle-related may have bearing on the fact that women with premenstrual dysphoria display enhanced responsiveness to these compounds. Further, it is suggested that the respiratory abnormalities observed in panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoria partly may be due to alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission, and that an influence on brainstem regulation of respiration may contribute to the <b>antipanic</b> effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Abnormal angiotensin II activity is suggested to be of importance for the aberrations in respiration and heart rate variability observed in panic disorder, and tentatively also for the proneness to experience panic...|$|E
