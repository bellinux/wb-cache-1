In this work we study the feasibility to use 2 -hydroxyethyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate</b> as solvent for the electrodeposition of nickel. Results shown that in this reaction medium, it is possible to obtain pure and homogeneous deposits of nanocrystalline nickel. These deposits grow with an initial 3 D- and after following a 2 D-mechanism, with a roughness and crystal size, dependent on the electrodeposition conditions...|$|E

Extraction processes are usually adopted to separate bioactive ingredients from local plants. However, volatile traditional organic solvents are commonly used in the extraction process, which would lead to solvent loss and environment pollution. In this work, {{in order to improve}} the extraction process and develop a greener process, a microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) method was investigated to extract senkyunolide I, senkyunolide H and Z-ligustilide from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. Two ionic liquids, N, N-dimethyl-N-(2 -hydroxyethoxyethyl) <b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate</b> (DMHEEAP) and N, N-dimethyl(cyanoethyl) <b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate</b> (DMCEAP), were employed as extractants. Important factors such as system temperature, extraction time, solid-to-solvent ratio and particle size were studied. The results show the system temperature was main factor which affects the microwave assisted extraction process. The extraction equilibrium could be reached {{in a short period of}} time. The extraction efficiency was not affected by the phase ratio within a certain solid/solvent ratio range. The particle size of Ligusticum chuanxiong powder had no remarkable effect on extraction efficiency. The back-{{extraction of}} protic ionic liquids using n-hexane was realized, and the concentration of senkyunolide I and senkyunolide H hardly decreased, but the concentration of Z-ligustilide decreased by 39. 7 %. The extraction mechanism of the investigated microwave assisted ionic liquid extraction was the same as traditional organic solvent extraction...|$|E
30|$|A {{spectrophotometric}} assay {{based on the}} color reaction between N,N-didecyl-N-methyl-poly(oxyethyl) <b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate</b> (DMPAP) and 4 -[4 -(dipropylamino) phenylazo]-benzenesulfonic acid (propyl orange) {{was used to determine}} DMPAP concentrations as a wood preservative. The assay was carried out using a propyl orange solution at pH 2.9. The visible absorption spectrum of propyl orange showed an absorption maximum at 510 nm, which decreased linearly with increasing DMPAP concentration from 0 to 10 ppm. To apply this assay method to determine DMPAP retention in treated wood, the influence of wood extractives on the assay was investigated. Extractives from Japanese cedar, hinoki cypress, and Japanese larch were found to increase apparent DMPAP concentration. However, it was also found that measuring visible absorption at 477 nm prevented overestimation and gave precise values. This assay can be a viable alternative to the current methods for the determination of DMPAP concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., <b>ammonium</b> acetate, <b>propionate,</b> butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteria}} that mediate the anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) are detected worldwide in natural and man-made ecosystems, and contribute up to 50 % {{to the loss}} of inorganic nitrogen in the oceans. Two different anammox species rarely live in a single habitat, suggesting that each species has a defined but yet unknown niche. Here we describe a new anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacterium with a defined niche: the co-oxidation of <b>propionate</b> and <b>ammonium.</b> The new anammox species was enriched in a laboratory scale bioreactor in the presence of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>propionate.</b> Interestingly, this particular anammox species could out-compete other anammox bacteria and heterotrophic denitrifiers for the oxidation of propionate in the presence of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate. We provisionally named the new species Candidatus "Anammoxoglobus propionicus"...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{propionate}} {{has been}} widely used as a preservative in bakery and in bread. It is sometimes not carefully used, or a high concentration is added to preserve products. High consumption of calcium propionate can lead to several health problems. This study aims to develop a fast and simple semiquantitative method based on color complex formation for the determination of calcium propionate in a bread sample. A red–brown complex {{was obtained from the}} reaction of ferric <b>ammonium</b> sulfate and <b>propionate</b> anion. The product was rapidly formed and easily observed with the concentration of propionate anion > 0. 4  mg/mL. A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was also developed and validated for comparison. Twenty-two bread samples from three markets near Bangkok were randomly selected and assayed for calcium propionate using the above two developed methods. The results showed that 19 / 22 samples contained calcium propionate > 2000  mg/kg. The results of the complex formation method agreed with the HPLC method...|$|R
40|$|The MixAlco process, a {{proprietary}} technology owned by Texas A&M University, converts biomass (e. g., municipal solid waste, sewage sludge, paper, agricultural residues, and energy crops) into usable chemicals (e. g., acetic acid) and fuels (e. g., ethanol). Historically, calcium carbonate {{has been used}} as the buffer. Recently, it was found that using ammonium bicarbonate as the buffering agent enhances the fermentation conversion. In this case, fermentation broth contains ammonium salts (e. g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate, pentanoate). Therefore, the downstream processing steps (including extraction, purification, esterification, and product separation) must be compatible with the ammonium carboxylate salts formed in the fermentation. This research focuses on converting fermentation broth carboxylate salts into their corresponding acids via "acid springing. " Reactive extraction and thermal conversion (distillation) are crucial parts of the acid springing process. Because the components of the fermentation broth are over 80 % ammonium acetate and 20 % other ammonium carboxylate salts (<b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate,</b> butyrate, pentanoate, etc.), all the initial experiments in this study were performed using reagentgrade ammonium acetate to simplify the reaction. Later, actual fermentation broth was employed. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} provide the optimal operating conditions to make the downstream processing steps of the MixAlco process compatible with ammonium carboxylate salts formed in the fermentation. The optimal initial concentration for reactive extraction should be 150 - 200 g/L and the volume ratio of aqueous phase and extractant should be 1 : 1. The distribution coefficient reaches the maximum value when the concentration of TOA is 20 % (vol %) in n-octanol. The batch distillation study shows that there are two reaction stages: (1) water leaves the system at 100 - 106 ?C and (2) the acid-amine complex decomposes at 160 - 180 ?C...|$|E
40|$|Statement of the problem: In {{selecting}} a disinfectant for dental shade guides, compatibility between the disinfectant {{and the type}} of the shade guide material must be considered to avoid adverse effects on the color stability. The effect of disinfecting solutions on the color of shade guides used in the selection of porcelain shade is unknown. If present, it is a major deficiency in achieving optimum esthetics and color matching restorations. Purpose: This study determined whether chemical disinfectants affect the color of porcelain shade guides after disinfection and long-term immersion. Material and Methods: Sixty new Vita Lumin shade guides for porcelain were used (A 3). They were subjected to spectrophotometeric test using the VITA Easyshade before disinfection (The baseline reading served as control). Disinfection methods included immersion for 10 minutes in 1 of the tested disinfectant solutions (5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite, 2 % alkaline gluteraldehyde or 1. 7 % trialkyl <b>ammonium</b> <b>propionate).</b> The specimens were cleaned after disinfection; the cleaning methods included ultrasonic cleaning in distilled water for 5 minutes and for 10 minutes, steam cleaning for 30 seconds, and under tap water for 30 seconds (n= 5). The disinfection procedures were repeated 4 times and new measurements were made on each specimen after each disinfection cycle. Furthermore, this cycle was repeated after one day of immersion. A random selection of pilot sample of the porcelain shade guide tabs was studied in the same manner and compared to the baseline results. The Lab value were recorded and ΔE were calculated. Statistical analysis of data was conducted with repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and single factor analysis of variance (alpha=. 05). Results: All the disinfectant solutions used produced a perceivable change in color (ΔE> 1). Immersion time has the most significant effect on ΔE (P<. 001). Conclusion: There was no preferred cleaning method that has significant reduction in color change. However, tap water and steam cleaning were associated with smaller ΔE values. The recommended time of immersion by manufacturer should be followed. Overnight immersion for disinfection should be avoided. Frequent and periodic check ups for changes in the color (ΔE) of shade guides are indicated. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|The Rhodes BioSURE Process is a {{low cost}} active {{treatment}} system for acid mine drainage (AMD) waters (Rose et al., 2002). Central to this process is biological sulphate reduction (BSR) using primary sewage sludge (PSS) as the electron donor and organic carbon source, with the concomitant reduction of sulphate to sulphide and production of alkalinity. To optimise the design, operation and control of (and research into) BSR with PSS, a mathematical kinetic model would be an invaluable aid. This study describes the development of such a kinetic model. Sötemann et al. (2005) have proposed a two phase (aqeous / gas) physical, biological and chemical processes kinetic model for the methanogenic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges (UCTADM 1). This model incorporates biological processes for sewage sludge hydrolysis / solubilisation (usually the rate limiting step) and acidification, acetogenesis, and acetotrophic(clastic) and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Additionally, the background weak acid/base chemistry for water, carbonate, acetate, <b>propionate,</b> <b>ammonium</b> and phosphate species have been included, {{as well as the}} physical gas exchanges for carbon dioxide an...|$|R

Effect of Lactobacillus buchneri, L. fermentum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides {{inoculants}} or {{a chemical}} additive on the fermentation, aerobic stability and nutritive value of crimped wheat grains. ? Journal of Dairy Science, 86, (5), 1789 - 1796. Sponsorship: Lallemand Animal Nutrition, Cedex, FranceThe preservation of crimped wheat grains by three bacterial inoculants or a chemical additive was compared. Crimped wheat grain [56. 8 g dry matter (DM) /kg] was conserved in 1. 75 -kg plastic bag, mini-silos without treatment, with 4 L/tonne of Crimpstore (CS; an additive containing {{a mixture of}} <b>ammonium</b> formate, <b>propionate,</b> ethyl benzoate, and benzoate, SAS Kelvin Cave, Ltd., UK) or 1 x 105 cfu/g of each of three inoculant additives containing Lactobacillus fermentum (A), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (B), and Lactobacillus buchneri (C). Six replicates were conserved per treatment. Ensiling DM losses, chemical composition, fermentation characteristics, and aerobic stability were measured in the silages after 68 d of ensiling. All the silages were well fermented and remained stable for 84 h after aeration. Subsequently, the rate of deterioration was slowest in crimped grains treated with CS treatment, followed by those treated with inoculant C, while those treated with inoculant A deteriorated most rapidly. Residual water-soluble carbohydrate concentration was higher in crimped grains treated with CS than those treated with the inoculants. Ammonia nitrogen concentrations were lowest in CS-treated crimped grains, followed by inoculants C and A. DM losses were greater in CS-treated crimped grains than in crimped grains treated with inoculants A and C. In vivo digestibility was also measured in Texel-cross lambs fed a grass silage basal diet supplemented with the additive-treated crimped grains or a conventional, lamb finisher concentrate. Dry matter intake and digestibility were unaffected by treatment. In conclusion, bacterial inoculants containing L. buchneri are promising preservatives for crimped wheat grains. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{dialysis}} {{cultivation system}} {{was used to}} enrich slow-growing moderately thermophilic anaerobic bacteria at high cell densities. Bicarbonate buffered mineral salts medium with 5 mM glutamate as the sole carbon and energy source was used and the incubation temperature was 55 degrees C. The reactor inoculum originated from anaerobic methanogenic granular sludge bed reactors. The microbial population was monitored {{over a period of}} 2 years using the most probable number (MPN) technique. In the reactor glutamate was readily degraded to ammonium, methane, and carbon dioxide. Cell numbers of glutamate-degrading organisms increased 400 -fold over the first year. In medium supplemented with bromoethane sulfonic acid (BES, an inhibitor of methanogenesis), tenfold lower cell numbers were counted, indicating the syntrophic nature of glutamate degradation. After 2 years of reactor operation the predominant organisms were isolated and characterized. Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (strain R 43) and a Methanosaeta thermophila strain (strain A) were the predominant hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens, respectively. The numbers in which the organisms were present in the reactor after 24 months of incubation were 8. 6 x 10 (9) and 3. 8 x 10 (7) mL(- 1) sludge, respectively. The most predominant glutamate-degrading organism (8. 6 x 10 (7) mL(- 1) sludge), strain Z, was identified as a new species, Caloramator coolhaasii. It converted glutamate to hydrogen, acetate, some <b>propionate,</b> <b>ammonium,</b> and carbon dioxide.
