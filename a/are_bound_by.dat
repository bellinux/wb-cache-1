5|$|Central “substrate domain” {{containing}} multiple repeats of tyrosine residues {{embedded within}} specific conserved sequences (YxxP) (amino acids 69-350 for human EFS). This region contains 9 such binding sites, {{in contrast to}} family members BCAR1 and NEDD9 (20 and 18 motifs, respectively) and similar to CASS4 (estimated at 10 such motifs). Once phosphorylated by SRC or other kinases, these tyrosine motifs <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> the SH2 domains of signaling proteins. Important binding partners for this region include Crk1/2 and Crk-L, a Crk1 paralogue.|$|E
5|$|Deshasthas, {{like all}} other Hindu Brahmins, trace their {{paternal}} ancestors {{to one of the}} seven or eight sages, the saptarshi. They classify themselves into eight gotras, named after the ancestor rishi. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest, although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern Deshastha families who <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> more practical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state is}} divided into {{judicial}} districts presided over by a District and Sessions Judge. He {{is known as a}} District Judge when he presides over a civil case, and a Sessions Judge when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a High Court judge. Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the Constitution, all courts in India (which includes High Courts) <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence.|$|E

50|$|Dimensional analogy {{also helps}} in {{inferring}} basic properties {{of objects in}} higher dimensions. For example, two-dimensional objects <b>are</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> one-dimensional boundaries: a square <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> four edges. Three-dimensional objects <b>are</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> two-dimensional surfaces: a cube <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> 6 square faces. By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer that a four-dimensional cube, known as a tesseract, <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> three-dimensional volumes. And indeed, this is the case: mathematics shows that the tesseract <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>by</b> 8 cubes. Knowing this is key to understanding how to interpret a three-dimensional projection of the tesseract. The boundaries of the tesseract project to volumes in the image, not merely two-dimensional surfaces.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams {{opted for a}} move back to England, signing for League Two side Oxford United on 27 January 2011 {{for the rest of}} the 2010–11 campaign. However, the {{transfer}} collapsed as a result of Myrie-Williams having already played for two clubs during the 2010–11 season— playing one game for Dundee United and eight for St Johnstone. Under FIFA regulations, a player can not play for more than two permanent clubs in a season. The English Football Association could not register Myrie-Williams as they <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> FIFA regulations. Similarly, the Football League could not register him to play for Oxford as his international clearance could not be granted.|$|E
5|$|The levels contain {{features}} like vertical loops, springs, and rails that the player can grind on. Each level {{is divided into}} three acts, punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end; all three acts, the boss fight, and two minigames that grant the player extra lives <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> a hub world. Within each act, the player collects Chao creatures; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage, where a Chaos Emerald can be found. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds, which can be done after completion of the main campaign, allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game's true ending.|$|E
5|$|Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines {{takes place}} in four areas of 21st-century Los Angeles: Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown. Set in the World of Darkness, the game depicts {{a world in which}} vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires <b>are</b> <b>bound</b> <b>by</b> a code to {{maintain}} their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the Camarilla, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.|$|E
