5|$|On {{board the}} Normandy, Tali is {{initially}} {{excited to be}} there, intrigued by the advanced technology used to power the Normandy, and stays in the engine room as a result. The next time Shepard speaks to her, though, Tali now seems saddened and withdrawn. She tells Shepard that she's losing sleep, since the Normandy's engines run so quietly compared to ships in her home flotilla, where quiet ships indicate a bad engine or a malfunctioning air filter, plus the ship, due to how it's spread out, seems emptier. This results in Tali feeling slightly homesick and she ponders if the true purpose of the Pilgrimage is to remind her people what they still have. The next time Shepard speaks to her, Tali's spirits are back up, having adjusted to living on the Normandy, plus how the crew has been treating her like one of their own, especially Shepard. She thanks Shepard for this, saying that Quarians are treated as second-class citizens by other races and Shepard {{is the first to}} treat her as an equal. If the player completes a particular side-mission involving the geth and then speak to Tali afterwards, she will <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can have a copy of the geth data that Shepard recovered, explaining that it is exactly what she needs to complete her Pilgrimage. If the player allows her to have a copy, Tali is overly happy, promising to pay back Shepard by helping them defeat Saren. If the player declines, Tali will still promise to stay to fight Saren, but will then leave afterwards so she can finish her Pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Further {{allegations}} of sexism from Năstase then came to light. Pam Shriver said that Năstase would frequently in a joking manner <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{was still a}} virgin. After about thirty occasions of this happening Shriver asked him to stop saying that, which he did. Dominique Monami, captain of the Belgium team, then mentioned that Năstase had abused her in the round prior to the match with Great Britain. Monami later added that Năstase was abusive for two games during the Elise Mertens and Irina-Camelia Begu match.|$|E
25|$|On August 8, 1969, Tate was {{two weeks}} from giving birth. She entertained two friends, actresses Joanna Pettet and Barbara Lewis, for lunch at her home, confiding in them her {{disappointment}} at Polanski's delay in returning from London. That afternoon, Polanski telephoned her as did her younger sister, Debra, who called to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> and their sister, Patti, could {{spend the night with}} her. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, Tate dined at her favorite restaurant, El Coyote, with Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski and Abigail Folger, returning at about 10:30p.m.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will take his last name instead of saying what he should have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer. But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon. Navid also returns and reveals that he wants to resume his relationship with Silver, who has found out she has the cancer gene. This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials. Naomi gets the shock of her life when she learns that the groom-to-be is none other than Max, her ex-boyfriend. At the bachelor party Max questions Naomi, asking her if he is doing the right thing, and before she can reply is interrupted by Max's fiancée. During the rehearsal wedding, Holly's mother offers Naomi a job offer that she cannot refuse. Naomi takes the offer, but at the airport is talked out of it by Austin because she is still in love with Max. As the wedding of Madison and Max begins, Naomi abruptly interrupts the services and confesses her love for Max. Elsewhere, Ivy is seen going off to Mexico to be with Diego, who was deported because he was an illegal immigrant in the U.S., and only ask for a one-way ticket. Diego and Ivy had begun dating and Diego had helped cease the pain she had been feeling after Raj's death. Diego was arrested for illegal graffiti, and that is why he was being deported. Annie and Caleb break off their relationship because Caleb cannot leave the covenant for Annie; nor does she think he should. Navid reveals that he isn't ready to have a baby, which causes Silver to dump him. She still wants to conceive a child and proposes to have a baby...with Teddy. At {{the very end of the}} season finale, Adrianna is boarding a plane to Las Vegas to kickstart her country music career because Dixon has not returned on time from the tour, but little does she know the car broke down and he had to hitchhike. As Dixon is on the phone with Navid telling him to stop Adrianna, a truck hits Dixon's car and it is left unknown if Dixon is still alive.|$|E
500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is really going to date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948, Michael Redgrave {{recommended}} Bikel to {{his friend}} Laurence Olivier as understudy for the parts of both Stanley Kowalski and Mitch in the West End premiere of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Bikel graduated from understudy to star opposite the director's wife, Vivien Leigh, with a sudden unplanned performance when a co-star, {{playing the role of}} Mitch, came down with a case of flu. Bikel showed up backstage and went directly to Leigh's dressing room to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to rehearse with him, {{to make sure he was}} right for the role.

Erica Duggan rang the roommate's cell phone and at around 11am, it was answered and passed to a Schiller Institute manager. The manager reportedly said the group was a news agency, adding [...] "We cannot {{take responsibility for the}} actions of individuals. We think your son has psychological problems." [...] She said she would call the local hospitals to see whether Duggan had been admitted. Shortly after this, the manager and Duggan's roommate, along with another member, handed Duggan's passport, bag and rucksack to the Wiesbaden police station. The manager told The Independent: [...] "I believed he had psychological problems, based on the conversations he had with people.

60|$|When we went {{again to}} the {{hospital}} we saw a nursing sister. She told us that Blanche seemed a little better, and she went in to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would see her husband.
