25|$|During World War II, the US Navy {{required}} a weapon effective against surface ships, {{such as the}} German Bismarck class battleships. Although missile and TV technology existed, {{the size of the}} primitive guidance systems available rendered <b>automatic</b> <b>guidance</b> impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated Project Pigeon, which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.|$|E

5000|$|William Alden, a {{graduate}} of the Harvard Business School, started Alden Self-Transit Systems Corporation around 1955. His idea was to design a [...] "dual-mode" [...] transit system [...] - [...] small cars that operated like traditional electric cars when driven around town for short distances, but allowed long-distance travel via automated guideways that provided power. The vehicle were quite lightweight because they could only travel at low speeds when manually guided and didn't need full crash safety or large battery packs. On the guideways they travelled much faster; they were protected from collisions by the automated guideway, and conductors on the guideway provided the power needed for high speeds while also recharging the batteries for local travel at the destination. Alden envisioned guideways being built in place of the existing interstate roads, but the <b>automatic</b> <b>guidance</b> allowed for much shorter headways and thereby increased route capacity, reducing the need for multiple lanes.|$|E

These include sensors to measure traffic flows and <b>automatic,</b> interconnected, <b>guidance</b> systems to manage traffic (for example, traffic signs which open a lane in different directions depending {{on the time of}} day). Also, traffic flow and speed sensors are used to detect problems and alert operators, so that the cause of the congestion can be determined, and measures can be taken to minimize delays. These systems are collectively called intelligent transportation systems.|$|R
