5|$|The {{history of}} Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the Augustan period up until 260AD, {{a time of}} {{exceptional}} peace and prosperity.

The Romans urbanized the territory with numerous settlements <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> network of high-quality Roman roads connecting them, allowing for the integration of Helvetia into the imperial economy.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} visiting black stars {{became part of}} the British R scene. These {{included}} Geno Washington, an American singer stationed in England with the Air Force.

Another American GI, Herbie Goins, sang with Blues Incorporated before leading his own band, the Nightimers.

5|$|A {{variation}} of this origin of Chamba {{is that it}} originated as a hermitage which Champavati, a devout Hindu, used to frequent. The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity, one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he {{was said to have}} heard a voice which informed him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals. The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple, named in his daughter’s honour <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> city around the temple. Today this temple, called the Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King’s daughter is venerated as a goddess. Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.|$|E
5|$|After Leif's {{first trip}} to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders. His father Erik reacted coldly to the suggestion that he should abandon his religion, while his mother Thjóðhildr quickly became a Christian <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> church called Thjóðhild's Church. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates. Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain.|$|E
5|$|After {{their water}} ran out, the Beck/Fiszer group {{developed}} a routine whereby {{some of the}} group worked to dig a well, while others watched out for approaching Germans, and yet others ventured outside the bunker to scavenge for useful items. The group eventually dug their way to two water canals <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> well. On November 17, during an excursion outside the bunker, the group made contact with a small partisan unit, also in hiding, led by a Russian soldier POW who had been liberated during the uprising. Subsequently, several of the group would join the partisans for small scale attacks on German troops. The group survived until the entry of the Red Army in mid-January.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's European Cup defeat to Benfica in October 1991 is {{regarded}} as a watershed moment in Graham's managerial career. He altered his tactics <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> stubborn team, which lacked the creativity associated with the first half of his Arsenal reign. Graham's Arsenal struggled to put together a title challenge in the newly-formed Premier League, but were cup specialists in the early half of the nineties. In 1992–93, Graham became the first manager to win the FA Cup and League Cup in the same season. A season later, he guided Arsenal to their first European trophy for almost a quarter of a century, as the team won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.|$|E
5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim <b>and</b> <b>built</b> <b>a</b> sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
