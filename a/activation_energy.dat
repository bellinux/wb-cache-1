Electron beams fluidise or quasi-melt glasses without significant increase of temperature on intensive irradiation: e.g. intensive electron radiation causes a many orders of magnitude decrease of viscosity and stepwise decrease of its <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, {{there was a}} wave of {{attempts}} to dope synthetic CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b> Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E
5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E

The mobilities of F-centre migration on bleaching of injected electrons were measured and the <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> of bleaching WF have been found.

40|$|We {{present a}} study demonstrating the {{dependence}} of apparent <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> on signal charge in digital image sensors. The data {{presented in this paper}} are for a charge-coupled device imager, but the analysis can be applied to CMOS sensors or generally to any system that shows nonlinearity with respect to time. <b>Activation</b> <b>energies</b> for some pixels are observed to vary between values at about half the bandgap of silicon, when calculated at low signal-charge levels, to values approaching the bandgap when calculated at high signal-charge levels. As such, the traditional method of calculating <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> using a single exposure time at varying temperatures will result in different <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> dependent on the exposure time chosen, making it difficult to draw physically meaningful conclusions from its value. Therefore, a method of calculating <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> using a single signal-charge level is proposed, making it easier to correlate <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> with impurities. Further, we demonstrate how a model of a pixel with a fixed location impurity in conjunction with a moving depletion edge, due to a changing depletion region size, can lead to this behavior...|$|R
40|$|From the {{experimental}} data on stepwise thermal release of neutron induced 39 Ar (39 K (n, p) 39 Ar) from rocks and minerals, Arrhenius plots were constructed, which gave <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> for the thermal release process. The <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> for DSDP Leg 58 and Leg 60 submarine volcanic rocks range from 12 to 20 kcal/mol, whereas those for granodiorites and the K-feldspar separates have <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> ranging from 37 to 48 kcal/mol. The smaller <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> for the submarine volcanic rocks reflect the grain boundary diffusion process, while the thermal diffusion of 39 Ar from granodiorites and K-feldspar is essentially {{controlled by a}} volume diffusion. The grain boundary diffusion for the submarine volcanic rocks suggests that K resides essentially in the grain boundaries...|$|R
5|$|Like all catalysts, enzymes {{increase}} the reaction rate by lowering its <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b> Some enzymes {{can make their}} conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E
40|$|When the Kissinger {{method is}} used to {{investigate}} thin film growth kinetics, <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> obtained are often significantly {{higher than those of}} Arrhenius plots based on isothermal studies. The reason for the higher <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> is related to the sensitivity of the Kissinger analysis to nucleation effects. In fact, this often undesirable effect opens the possibility of studying nucleation barriers in a semiquantitative way. Furthermore, we show that these nucleation effects can be filtered out by a more careful application of the Kissinger method, and <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> that are consistent with Arrhenius plots are then obtained. status: publishe...|$|R

A consistent atomistic description of self-diffusion and the order-order relaxation process is {{discussed in terms of}} effective atomic jump frequencies and the current degree of chemical long-range order. It is demonstrated that the thermodynamic <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> of self-diffusion and the order-order relaxation can be expressed in terms of the <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> of more elementary processes.

The BIX-LNC were prepared by the technique of interfacial deposition of preformed polymer, with a mean diameter (D 4, 3) of 195  ±  27  nm.

In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system.
