5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>in</b> part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E
