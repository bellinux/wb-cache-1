25|$|The word is {{pronounced}} tseh-tseh in the Sotho languages and is easily rendered in other African languages. During World War II, a de Havilland <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{was known as}} the 'Tsetse' Mosquito.|$|E
25|$|During its inter-fleet transfer, {{the carrier}} Reagan and its {{embarked}} CVW-11 aircraft participated on several bilateral and multilateral naval exercises. On 17 June 2004, two Super Étendard jet fighters and three S-2T Turbo Trackers <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the Argentine Navy carried out touch-and-go landings on the Reagans flight deck during Gringo-Gaucho exercises (pictured). The Reagan Carrier Strike Group {{also participated in}} a SIFOREX (Silent Forces) exercise with the Peruvian Navy prior to its port visit to Callao, Peru, on 9 July 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} of V./KG 40 (which was redesignated I./Zerstörergeschwader 1 in 1943) were {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and operated as escort fighters for the more vulnerable Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor maritime patrol bombers. Between July 1942 and July 1944, the Ju 88s of KG 40 and ZG 1 were credited with 109 confirmed air-to-air victories, {{at a cost of}} 117 losses. They were finally deployed against the Allied Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, incurring heavy losses for little effect before being disbanded on 5 August 1944.|$|E
5000|$|P-2 Neptune, {{known as}} [...] "P2V Neptune" [...] until 1962, a United States Navy {{maritime}} patrol and <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft</b> introduced in 1947 ...|$|R
50|$|Formed in late 1942 and {{equipped}} with Lockheed Ventura <b>antisubmarine</b> patrol <b>aircraft.</b> Assigned to Third Air Force and performed antisubmarine patrols over the Southeast Atlantic coast until July 1943.|$|R
50|$|Later the US Navy {{tested the}} Fulton system fitted to {{modified}} S-2 Tracker carrier-based <b>antisubmarine</b> patrol <b>aircraft</b> {{for use in}} rescuing downed pilots. It is unknown whether a Fulton equipped S-2 was ever used on a combat mission.|$|R
2500|$|The {{group also}} {{helped develop the}} radar altimeter, or {{absolute}} altimeter. [...] This device used a microwave radar to determine an aircraft's exact altitude above the surface within ten feet. This altimeter permitted <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> to fly safely as low as 50 feet above the surface. Low altitude attacks substantially improved the chances of destroying the target submarine. This device became standard equipment on Army Air Forces <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> by 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} development {{assisted by}} the group was LORAN. LORAN transmitters, located at known points allowed an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> to receive signals from three stations, allowing the aircraft to pinpoint its location to within four miles as far as 1,500 miles from the transmitters. [...] LORAN permitted efficient control of converging air and surface forces for a coordinated attack.|$|E

50|$|Finally, a B-47E was loaned to the U.S. Navy to help {{test the}} GE TF34-2 {{turbofan}} for the Lockheed S-3 Viking carrier-based <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft.</b> This B-47E {{was given the}} designation NB-47E and performed test flights from 1969 through 1975.|$|R
50|$|Wasp {{returned}} to San Diego on 15 October {{and while there}} was reclassified an <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft</b> carrier CVS-18, effective on 1 November 1956. She spent {{the last days of}} 1956 in San Diego preparing for her transfer to the east coast.|$|R
50|$|Mitchel Field was a {{major source}} of supply in initial garrisoning and defense of North Atlantic air bases in Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland. From the {{airfield}} the planning for the air defense of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was conducted. Antisubmarine patrol missions along the Atlantic coast were carried out in 1942 by the United States Army Air Forces <b>Antisubmarine</b> Command <b>aircraft</b> based at Mitchel.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the command}} of Officer-in-Charge Captain John A. Dunaway, <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Test Directorate was tasked to support the fleet through the flight test and {{evaluation}} of aircraft systems for the VP, VS, VAW, VRC, VQ (TACAMO), VQ (ELINT/SIGINT), VR, and VT squadrons.|$|E
50|$|The United States Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command {{assigned}} several squadrons of long-range <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> (B-24 Liberator, B-18 Bolo) to fly killer-hunter flights {{over the}} Grand Banks and also provide convoy escort overflights from Newfoundland. After {{the fall of}} 1943, these missions were undertaken by the United States Navy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{squadron}} flew OP-2E Neptune aircraft, {{a modification}} of the P-2E Neptune maritime patrol and <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft.</b> [...] Three unit aircraft were lost on combat missions {{with a total of}} 20 men killed. The unit received the Navy Unit Commendation and, in May 2008, was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its highly classified missions and for its intense aerial support of the Marines during the Battle of Khe Sanh.|$|R
5000|$|A surface action group, <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare patrol <b>aircraft,</b> the amphibious {{ships to}} carry a MEU on station, and the {{prepositioning}} ships at Diego Garcia which by 1982 could provide the supplies to sustain the 7th MAB for over two weeks and supply several tactical air force squadrons.|$|R
50|$|A surface {{covered with}} ice, of course, is tremendously {{difference}} than even storm-driven water. Purely from a collision avoidance and acoustic propagation, a submarine {{needs to know}} how close {{it is to the}} bottom of ice. Less obvious is the need to know the three-dimensional structure of the ice, because submarines may need to break through it to launch missiles, to raise4 electronic masts, or to surface the boat. Three-dimensional ice information also can tell the submarine captain whether <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft</b> can detect or attack the boat.|$|R
50|$|In April, 1975, after 30 {{years of}} {{operations}} at Patuxent River, the Flight Test Division, Weapons Test Division, Service Test Division, and U.S. Naval Test Pilot School reorganized under the Naval Air Test Center into the <b>Antisubmarine</b> <b>Aircraft</b> Test Directorate, Strike Aircraft Test Directorate, Rotary Aircraft Test Directorate, and Naval Test Pilot School.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, {{indigenous}} suppliers had developed and produced an almost complete range of modern equipment, including aircraft, tanks, artillery, and major surface and underwater naval combatants. Certain types of highly sophisticated weaponry, including F-15 fighters, P-3C Orion <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and 8-inch howitzers, were produced under license. Except {{for the most}} complex and costly items, such as the E-2C airborne earlywarning aircraft, little was purchased complete from foreign suppliers.|$|E
5000|$|The Mid-Atlantic Gap is a {{geographical}} term attributed to an undefended area {{beyond the reach}} of land-based RAF Coastal Command <b>antisubmarine</b> (A/S) <b>aircraft</b> during the Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. It is frequently known as The Black Pit, as well as the Atlantic Gap, Air Gap, Greenland Gap, or just [...] "the Gap". This resulted in heavy merchant shipping losses to U-boats. The gap was eventually closed in May 1943, as growing numbers of VLR Liberators (Very Long Range models) and escort carriers became available, and as basing problems were addressed.|$|R
50|$|During 1944 and 1945 Air Service Command used Jacksonville AAF as {{a staging}} base for Station Compliment squadrons {{prior to their}} {{overseas}} deployment. On 1 July 1944, the host unit, the 4203d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Aircraft Service) was re-designated the 4203d AAFBU (Air Base) {{as part of the}} transfer to Service Command. With {{the end of the war}} in Europe in May 1945, the Navy <b>antisubmarine</b> patrol <b>aircraft</b> were withdrawn, and Army personnel began to be reduced at airfield. Plans were made to return the airfield to civil control after the Japanese surrender in August 1945.|$|R
50|$|Given its {{criticality}} to Cold War {{operations against}} the Soviet Navy's submarine fleet, SOSUS / IUSS remained highly classified {{from its inception}} and the purpose and activities of the various NAVFACs was not publicly acknowledged nor commonly known outside of the U.S. Navy's submarine fleet, its cruiser/destroyer/frigate fleet, and its <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare <b>aircraft</b> forces {{until the end of}} the Cold War. In 1991, the system mission was declassified and the next year it began reporting whale detections and SOSUS work stations began replacing paper lofargrams. The Advanced Deployable System became operational as part of IUSS in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Active sonobuoys, {{containing}} a sonar transmitter and receiver, can be dropped from fixed-wing {{maritime patrol aircraft}} (e.g., P-3, Nimrod, Chinese Y-8, Russian and Indian Bear ASW variants), antisubmarine helicopters, and carrier-based <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> (e.g., S-3). While {{there have been some}} efforts to use other aircraft simply as carriers of sonobuoys, the general assumption is that the sonobuoy-carrying aircraft can issue commands to the sonobuoys and receive, and to some extent process, their signals.|$|E
50|$|After three arduous war patrols, Morton {{was given}} the highly {{dangerous}} assignment of penetrating the Sea of Japan for the second time. Commander Morton was reported missing in action in December, when his submarine was presumed lost. After the war, it was determined from Japanese records that, on October 11, in the time frame in which the Wahoo was expected to exit through La Perouse Strait, an <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> found a surfaced submarine and attacked, dropping three depth charges.|$|E
50|$|On 5 September 2008 {{the deputy}} {{commander}} of Russian Naval Aviation, Maj.Gen. Nikolai Kuklev, {{announced that the}} A-42 is to be adopted as a main SAR and <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> of the Russian Navy, and a provisional contract for 4 SAR-outfitted aircraft has been awarded to the company, with deliveries to start in 2010. All four aircraft {{are expected to be}} in service by 2013. A contract to replace the aging fleet of Be-12 and Il-38 aircraft is under consideration.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the war the United States {{abandoned}} several surplus Curtiss HS flying {{boats that}} had been used for <b>antisubmarine</b> patrols; these <b>aircraft,</b> donated to the Canadian government, were heavily used in the immediate post-war period. Seaplanes could use lakes and rivers instead of airstrips, making them ideal for exploring remote regions. The flying boats were used both by the nascent RCAF, and by forestry companies seeking to patrol their logging areas for forest fires.|$|R
25|$|The ship {{returned}} to the east coast in September 1954 and resumed her normal operations. In December, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and conversion to an <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare (ASW) <b>aircraft</b> carrier. On 10 January 1955, while still undergoing conversion, she was redesignated CVS-40. Her alterations were completed that summer and, after shakedown, the carrier operated around Quonset Point, Rhode Island, conducting training missions with the ASW air squadrons based there. That fall, she participated in exercises with Hunter-Killer Group 4 before returning to Quonset Point {{to prepare for the}} 1956 Springboard exercise.|$|R
5000|$|The SH-60F {{primarily}} {{serves as}} the carrier battle group's primary <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare (ASW) <b>aircraft.</b> The helicopter hunts submarines with its AQS-13F dipping sonar, and carries a 6-tube sonobuoy launcher. The SH-60F is unofficially named [...] "Oceanhawk". The SH-60F can carry Mk 46, Mk 50, or Mk 54 torpedoes for its offensive weapons, {{and it has a}} choice of fuselage-mounted machine guns, including the M60D, M240D, and GAU-16 (.50 caliber) for self-defense. The standard aircrew consists of one pilot, one co-pilot, one tactical sensor operator (TSO), and one acoustic sensor operator (ASO).|$|R
50|$|During its inter-fleet transfer, {{the carrier}} Reagan and its {{embarked}} CVW-11 aircraft participated on several bilateral and multilateral naval exercises. On 17 June 2004, two Super Étendard jet fighters and three S-2T Turbo Trackers <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the Argentine Navy carried out touch-and-go landings on the Reagans flight deck during Gringo-Gaucho exercises (pictured). The Reagan Carrier Strike Group {{also participated in}} a SIFOREX (Silent Forces) exercise with the Peruvian Navy prior to its port visit to Callao, Peru, on 9 July 2004.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of defence cutbacks, the flying schools and No. 406 Squadron were disbanded in early 1964. For the next 15 years, the airport {{was the site of}} the RCAF's storage site for retired {{aircraft}} that were awaiting sale of disposal. A trip to this facility in the early 1970s would have revealed parked Dakotas, Neptune <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>aircraft</b> and T-33 trainers. This storage facility was overseen by the Canadian Forces 407 Technical Services Detachment, which contracted with Bristol Aerospace for this work. This facility closed in 1978.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} {{needed for}} the evolution of selected V/STOL research vehicles into optimized <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare (ASW) <b>aircraft</b> configurations, using numerical procedures and traditional analytical methods, has been examined. Three propulsion systems, which represent state-of-the-art development aimed at solving the thrust-vectoring and attitude-control problems of V/STOL aircraft, are analyzed. The use of NASA computer programs for aircraft synthesis (ACSYNT), and for optimizing configurations (COMMIN), coupled with contractor-supplied propulsion system data provides for accurate performance prediction of the selected ASW configurations. Particular emphasis on the transition phase between the research vehicle and the optimized configuration demonstrates {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} using generic research aircraft instead of building prototypes to demonstrate new technolog...|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} {{fitting out}} at the Boston Navy Yard on 21 September 1942, YMS-80 then proceeded to her new assignment via New York, New York; assigned to the Mine Warfare School at Yorktown, Virginia, she served as a school ship, training sailors in minesweeping, from 13 October 1942. After completing that tour of temporary duty at the Mine Warfare School on 13 March 1943, she proceeded to Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, and reported to Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet, for duty. On 4 July, she commenced minesweeping operations out of Portland, Maine, for antisubmarine warfare training with Task Group 27.1. Detached on 28 August 1943, YMS-80 proceeded thence to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and operated with the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Antisubmarine</b> Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet, out of Narragansett Bay, into the autumn of 1944.|$|R
50|$|Ticonderoga {{arrived in}} San Diego on 18 September. After {{almost a month}} of post-deployment stand-down, {{she moved to the}} Long Beach Naval Shipyard in mid-October to begin {{conversion}} to an <b>antisubmarine</b> warfare (ASW) <b>aircraft</b> carrier. Overhaul and conversion work began on 20 October, and Ticonderoga was redesignated CVS-14 the next day. She completed overhaul and conversion on 28 May 1970 and conducted exercises out of Long Beach for most of June. On 26 June, the new ASW support carrier entered her new home port, San Diego. In July-August, she conducted refresher training, refresher air operations, and carrier landing qualifications. She operated off the California coast {{for the remainder of the}} year and participated in two naval exercises-HUKASWEX 4-70 late in October and COMPUTEX 23-70 between 30 November and 3 December.|$|R
