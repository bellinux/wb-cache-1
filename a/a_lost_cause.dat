Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause,</b> and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E

5|$|On a {{cold day}} the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting {{as well as}} his mother's {{resulting}} protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment's first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause,</b> Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union's victory.|$|E
5|$|While at the {{hospital}} to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, {{who claims to have}} found something at the meatpacking plant. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and takes control of the games, and is given five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramer's will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause,</b> as proof of his methods. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to {{the hospital}}, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the box's key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.|$|E
5|$|In the fleet, President Roslin (Mary McDonnell) burns {{her book}} of Pythia, and {{is unable to}} address the fleet because of feeling that she led the fleet nowhere, and believing the prophecy is <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause.</b> Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and Anastasia Dualla (Kandyse McClure) revisit their relationship, and after their evening together, Dualla returns to her quarters, and commits suicide. Devastated by this, Admiral Adama acquires a handgun from a Marine and {{attempts}} to coerce Tigh (Michael Hogan) into killing him, which fails. Adama breaks down relieved and converses with Tigh about past memories, and Tigh reminding Adama of his duties as commander of the fleet. Adama eventually steps back into the CIC, and makes an announcement that he will find {{a home for the}} fleet, gives instructions to search for any nearby habitable star systems, and invites their new Cylon allies to join them. As the fleet prepares to leave Earth, which is determined to be uninhabitable, D'Anna (Lucy Lawless), devastated by the knowledge that history repeats itself endlessly, decides to remain on Earth to die, rather than being hunted by Cavil.|$|E

5|$|Jayawardene {{made his}} ODI debut against Zimbabwe on 24 January 1998, and scored his first century a year later, against England on 23 January 1999. Although not as illustrious as his Test centuries, {{he has since}} made 19 ODI centuries for Sri Lanka. This is the fourth-highest number of centuries for Sri Lanka by a single player behind Jayasuriya's 28, Sangakkara's 21, and Dilshan's 20. On 10 June 2007, Jayawardene scored 107 runs for the Asia XI team, which he captained during the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored an unbeaten 139 in the same match, and Jayawardene are the only players who have scored a century for Asia XI. Jayawardene became the sixth player to score a century at a Cricket World Cup Final with an unbeaten 103 against India during the final match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup. However, Sri Lanka lost the match, making Jayawardene the first centurion in <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause</b> at a World Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Throughout November, Japan's top {{military}} {{leaders at the}} IGH in Tokyo continued to openly support further efforts to retake Guadalcanal from Allied forces. At the same time, however, lower-ranking staff officers began to discreetly discuss abandoning the island. Takushiro Hattori and Masanobu Tsuji, each of whom had recently visited Guadalcanal, told their colleagues on the staff that any further attempt to retake the island was <b>a</b> <b>lost</b> <b>cause.</b> Ryūzō Sejima reported that the attrition of IJA troop-strength on Guadalcanal was so unexpectedly severe that future operations would be untenable. On 11 December, two staff officers, IJN Commander Yuji Yamamoto and IJA Major Takahiko Hayashi returned to Tokyo from Rabaul and confirmed Hattori's, Tsuji's, and Sejima's reports. They further reported {{that most of the}} IJN and IJA officers at Rabaul appeared to support abandoning Guadalcanal. Around this time, Japan's War Ministry informed the IGH that there was an insufficient amount of shipping to support both the effort to retake Guadalcanal and transport strategic resources to maintain Japan's economy and military forces.|$|E
5|$|Voldemort triumphantly announces Harry's {{apparent}} {{death to}} everyone at Hogwarts, and demands {{that they all}} surrender.

Harry and Voldemort's battle ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and killing him, once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner — Dumbledore — but, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and discards it.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Lost</b> <b>Cause</b> {{belief system}} {{synthesized}} numerous ideas into <b>a</b> coherent package. <b>Lost</b> <b>Cause</b> supporters argue that slavery {{was not the}} main cause of the Civil War, and claim that few scholars saw it as such before the 1950s. In order to reach this conclusion, they often deny or minimize the writings and speeches of Confederate leaders of the time in favor of later-written revisionist documents. [...] Supporters often stressed the idea of secession as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and say that threat violated the states' rights guaranteed by the Union. They believed any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The <b>Lost</b> <b>Cause</b> portrayed the South as more profoundly Christian than the greedy North. It portrayed the slavery system as more benevolent than cruel, emphasizing that it taught Christianity and civilization. In explaining Confederate defeat, the <b>Lost</b> <b>Cause</b> said the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the Yankee industrial machine.|$|R
5000|$|All in all, Hemmings was {{probably}} the second best off spinner in England from around 1982-1991 and was largely unfortunate that his best years coincided with John Emburey's. There were other contenders for the one place in the England team {{during the same time}} such as Geoff Miller, Vic Marks and Pat Pocock. However broadly speaking England selectors preferred their off spinners to be able to bat which explains why Geoff Miller was often selected. Hemmings was a useful batsman, twice frustrating the Australian test attack of 1989 at Trent Bridge {{to such an extent that}} there was a small on field altercation with Australian fast bowler Geoff Lawson just before tea on day 4 of that match - Hemmings having hit Lawson for several fours in <b>a</b> completely <b>lost</b> <b>cause</b> - the game was well and truly lost by this point.|$|R

5000|$|Kathleen Murphy of MSN Movies rated it two-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, {{calling it}} [...] "a subpar slasher movie tricked out with tired 'Ten Little Indians' tropes and rip-offs from both Carpenter and the Christian Nyby-Howard Hawks' 1951 version of the {{chilling}} tale that started it all, John W.

Jim Vejvoda of IGN Movies also rated the film two-and-a-half out of five, saying, [...] "This incarnation of The Thing is much like the creature it depicts: An insidious, defective mimic of the real, er, thing.
