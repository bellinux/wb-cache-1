5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} <b>amygdalin,</b> a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of <b>amygdalin</b> poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} {{is the value of}} protection: would the plant be less able to survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as <b>amygdalin.</b> This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> is {{classified}} as a cyanogenic glycoside because each <b>amygdalin</b> molecule includes a nitrile group, which can be released as the toxic cyanide anion {{by the action of}} a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people <b>amygdalin</b> releases the cyanide which poisons them. Neither <b>amygdalin</b> nor laetrile is a vitamin.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{prohibited}} the interstate shipment of <b>amygdalin</b> and laetrile in 1977. Thereafter, 27 U.S. states legalized {{the use of}} <b>amygdalin</b> within those states.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> is {{contained}} in stone fruit kernels, such as apricot (8%), peach (6%), bitter almond (5%), and plum (2.5%); <b>amygdalin</b> {{is also found in}} the seeds of the apple. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, <b>amygdalin</b> is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural <b>amygdalin</b> has the (R)-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the (S)-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of <b>amygdalin</b> is the (R)-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors also}} recommended, on ethical and {{scientific}} grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or <b>amygdalin</b> be conducted.|$|E
25|$|Mandelonitrile, {{with the}} formula C6H5CH(OH)CN, occurs {{in small amounts}} in the pits of some fruits. Related cyanogenic glycosides are known, such as <b>amygdalin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hypothesis (2) {{proposed}} that, after ingestion, <b>amygdalin</b> was hydrolyzed to mandelonitrile, transported intact to {{the liver}} and converted to a beta-glucuronide complex, which was then carried to the cancerous cells, hydrolyzed by beta-glucuronidases to release mandelonitrile and then HCN. This was considered untenable.|$|E
25|$|In 1845 <b>amygdalin</b> {{was used}} as a cancer {{treatment}} in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous. In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative, and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> is hydrolyzed by {{intestinal}} β-glucosidase (emulsin) and amygdalase to give gentiobiose and L-mandelonitrile. Gentiobiose {{is further}} hydrolyzed to give glucose, whereas the cyanohydrin of mandelonitrile decomposes to give benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide in sufficient quantities (allowable daily intake: ~0.6mg) causes cyanide poisoning (fatal oral dose: 0.6–1.5mg/kg). Apricot pits contain 89–2,170mg/kg hydrogen cyanide (wet weight).|$|E
25|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1830 from bitter almond seeds (Prunus dulcis) by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard. Liebig and Wöhler found three hydrolysis products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into D-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, D-glucose, and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{other members of the}} rose family, peach seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides, {{including}} <b>amygdalin</b> (note the subgenus designation: Amygdalus). These substances are capable of decomposing into a sugar molecule and hydrogen cyanide gas. While peach seeds are not the most toxic within the rose family (see bitter almond), large consumption of these chemicals from any source is potentially hazardous to animal and human health.|$|E
25|$|Like <b>amygdalin,</b> {{laetrile}} is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) {{and in the}} intestine (enzymatically) to D-glucuronic {{acid and}} L-mandelonitrile; the latter hydrolyzes to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, that in sufficient quantities causes cyanide poisoning. Intravenous laetrile does not result in cyanide exposure. This {{is due to the}} fact that the necessary enzymes are released either upon chewing the plant material or are provided by bacteria residing in the human gastrointestinal system.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> is a cyanogenic {{glycoside}} {{derived from the}} aromatic amino acid phenylalanine. <b>Amygdalin</b> and prunasin are very common among plants of the Rosaceae family, particularly the genus Prunus, Poaceae (grasses), Fabaceae (legumes), and in other food plants, including linseed and manioc. [...] Within these plants, <b>amygdalin</b> and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze them are stored in separate locations {{so that they will}} mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.|$|E
2500|$|Laetrile (patented 1961) is {{a simpler}} semisynthetic version of <b>amygdalin.</b> Laetrile is {{synthesized}} from <b>amygdalin</b> by hydrolysis. The usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels (Prunus armeniaca). The name {{is derived from}} the separate words [...] "laevarotatory" [...] and [...] "mandelonitrile". Laevarotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to its chemical identity ...|$|E
2500|$|Pioneer work in 1830 {{through a}} variety of {{experiences}} based on <b>amygdalin,</b> obtained from bitter almonds (the fruit of Prunus dulcis) oil by Pierre Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard, two French chemists, had produced [...] benzaldehyde [...] but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of <b>amygdalin</b> that would account for it, and thus missed the identification of the benzoyl radical [...] C7H5O.|$|E
2500|$|The U.S. National Institutes of Health {{evaluated}} the evidence separately {{and concluded that}} clinical trials of <b>amygdalin</b> showed little or no effect against cancer. For example, a 1982 trial by the Mayo Clinic of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased {{in all but one}} patient. The authors reported that [...] "the hazards of <b>amygdalin</b> therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range." ...|$|E
2500|$|Almonds, apricots, {{apples and}} cherry kernels contain {{significant}} amounts of <b>amygdalin.</b> This glycoside breaks up under enzyme catalysis into benzaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide and two molecules of glucose.|$|E
2500|$|The study {{concluded}} [...] "Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed {{about the danger}} of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. <b>Amygdalin</b> (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Amygdalin</b> (from Ancient Greek: [...] "almond") is a {{naturally}} occurring chemical compound, famous for falsely being promoted as a cancer cure. It {{is found in}} many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of apricot, bitter almonds, apple, peach, and plum.|$|E
2500|$|The European Food Safety Agency's Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain {{has studied}} the {{potential}} toxicity of the <b>amygdalin</b> in apricot kernels. [...] The Panel reported, [...] "If consumers follow the recommendations of websites that promote consumption of apricot kernels, their exposure to cyanide will greatly exceed" [...] the dose expected to be toxic. [...] The Panel also reported that acute cyanide toxicity had occurred in adults who had consumed 20 or more kernels and that in children [...] "five or more kernels appear to be toxic".|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s, both <b>amygdalin</b> and a {{modified}} form named laetrile have been promoted as alternative cancer treatments, often using the misnomer vitamin B17. But {{studies have found}} them to be clinically ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to cyanide poisoning. The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of quackery, and as [...] "the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most remunerative cancer quack promotion in medical history".|$|E
2500|$|HCN is {{obtainable}} from fruits {{that have}} a pit, such as cherries, apricots, apples, and bitter almonds, from which almond oil and flavoring are made. Many of these pits contain small amounts of cyanohydrins such as mandelonitrile and <b>amygdalin,</b> which slowly release hydrogen cyanide. One hundred grams of crushed apple seeds can yield about 70mg of HCN. Some millipedes release hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism, as do certain insects, such as some burnet moths. Hydrogen cyanide is contained in the exhaust of vehicles, and in smoke from burning nitrogen-containing plastics. So-called [...] "bitter" [...] roots of the cassava plant may contain up to 1gram of HCN per kilogram.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Privitera {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to possess and distribute laetrile for telling patients where to obtain it -apricot seeds-(yes, the fruit.) The case led to a Supreme Court of California decision in 1979. Citing Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended {{that the right to}} obtain laetrile is a fundamental right of privacy. The California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a compelling interest, and the state appealed. The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that [...] "the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'" [...] (So basically they were saying fruit should be illegal, yes the seeds from apricots.) The outcome was vitamin B-17 [...] "Amygdalin" [...] and apricot seeds were made legal to possess and sell and are widely available and consumed and purchased today. The term used [...] "laetrile" [...] is actually incorrect because that's referring to the injectable pharmaceutical form of <b>Amygdalin,</b> not the extract from the apricot seed. Privitera was soon pardoned by California governor Jerry Brown after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to Pardon him.|$|E
60|$|Thus, bitter almonds contain two substances, <b>amygdalin</b> and synaptase, {{which can}} be extracted, in a {{separate}} state, from the bitter almonds. The <b>amygdalin</b> thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase {{be added to the}} solution, the <b>amygdalin</b> splits up into bitter almond oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|E
60|$|As {{chemistry}} advanced, facts came {{to light}} which put a new face upon Stahl's hypothesis, {{and gave it a}} safer foundation than it previously possessed. The general nature of these phenomena may be thus stated:--A body, A, without giving to, or taking from, another body B, any material particles, causes B to decompose into other substances, C, D, E, the sum of the weights of which is equal to the weight of B, which decomposes. Thus, bitter almonds contain two substances, <b>amygdalin</b> and synaptase, which can be extracted, in a separate state, from the bitter almonds. The <b>amygdalin</b> thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase be added to the solution, the <b>amygdalin</b> splits up into bitter almond oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|E
6000|$|However, {{it may be}} asked, {{is there}} any {{necessary}} opposition between the so-called [...] "vital" [...] and the strictly physico-chemical views of fermentation? It {{is quite possible that}} the living Torula may excite fermentation in sugar, because it constantly produces, as an essential part of its vital manifestations, some substance which acts upon the sugar, just as the synaptase acts upon the <b>amygdalin.</b> Or it may be, that, without the formation of any such special substance, the physical condition of the living tissue of the yeast plant is sufficient to effect that small disturbance of the equilibrium of the particles of the sugar, which Lavoisier thought sufficient to effect its decomposition.|$|E
60|$|A {{short time}} after Cagniard de la Tour {{discovered}} the yeast plant, Liebig, struck with {{the similarity between}} this and other such processes and the fermentation of sugar, put forward the hypothesis that yeast contains a substance which acts upon sugar, as synaptase acts upon <b>amygdalin.</b> And as the synaptase is certainly neither organized nor alive, but a mere chemical substance, Liebig treated Cagniard de la Tour's discovery with no small contempt, and, from that time to the present, has steadily repudiated {{the notion that the}} decomposition of the sugar is, in any sense, the result of the vital activity of the Torula. But, though the notion that the Torula is a creature which eats sugar and excretes carbonic acid and alcohol, which is not unjustly ridiculed in the most surprising paper that ever made its appearance in a grave scientific journal,[4] may be untenable, the fact that the Toruloe are alive, and that yeast does not excite fermentation unless it contains living Toruloe, stands fast. Moreover, of late years, the essential participation of living organisms in fermentation other than the alcoholic, has been clearly made out by Pasteur and other chemists.|$|E

[Footnote 4: [...] "Das enträthselte Geheimniss der geistigen Gährung (Vorlänfige briefliche Mittheilung)" [...] is {{the title}} of an {{anonymous}} contribution to Wöhler and Liebig's Annalen der Pharmacie for 1839, in which a somewhat Rabelaisian imaginary description of the organisation of the [...] "yeast animals" [...] and of {{the manner in which}} their functions are performed, is given with a circumstantiality worthy of the author of Gulliver's Travels. As a specimen of the writer's humour, his account of what happens when fermentation comes to an end may suffice. [...] "Sobald nämlich die Thiere keinen Zucker mehr vorfinden, so fressen sie sich gegenseitig selbst auf, was durch eine eigene Manipulation geschieht; alles wird verdant bis auf die Eier, welche unverändert durch den Darmkanal hineingehen; man hat zuletzt wieder gährungsfähige Hefe, nämlich den Saamen der Thiere, der übrig bleibt."] However, it may be asked, is there any necessary opposition between the so-called [...] "vital" [...] and the strictly physico-chemical views of fermentation?
