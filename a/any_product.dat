5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted a company (run by his cousins and initially catering to fan club members), to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings (£1.50) and badges for 6 pence (6d) (2½p). It sold 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the group's popularity grew. When Beatlemania swept the UK in November 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies desperate {{to use the}} Beatles' name on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and other merchandise. Epstein refused to allow the Beatles to endorse <b>any</b> <b>product</b> directly, but through NEMS Enterprises he granted discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce quality products at a fair price, even though many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E

5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is <b>any</b> <b>product</b> less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E

Bull Durham ads proved this theory wrong, however, as the various campaigns became some of the most successful of the time and paved the way to modern day advertising.|$|E

25|$|Homeopathy {{is fairly}} common in some {{countries}} while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated {{in some countries}} and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required.

New Zealand Customs and police officers continued to make large interceptions of precursor substances believed to be destined for methamphetamine production. On 9 October 2009, Prime Minister John Key announced pseudoephedrine-based cold and flu tablets would become prescription-only drugs and reclassified as a class B2 drug. The law was amended by The Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill 2010, which passed in August 2011.|$|E
25|$|Roussel Uclaf did {{not seek}} U.S. approval, so in the United States legal {{availability}} was not initially possible. The United States banned importation of mifepristone for personal use in 1989, a decision supported by Roussel Uclaf. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave the U.S. drug rights to the Population Council in exchange for immunity from <b>any</b> <b>product</b> liability claims. The Population Council sponsored clinical trials in the United States. The drug went on approvable status from 1996. Production was intended to begin through the Danco Group in 1996, but they withdrew briefly in 1997 due to a corrupt business partner, delaying availability again.|$|E

25|$|Pebble Technology Corporation raised $10.3 million {{through a}} Kickstarter {{campaign}} running from April 11, 2012, through May 18, 2012; {{this was the}} most money raised for <b>any</b> <b>product</b> on the site at that time. Best Buy, an American consumer electronics corporation, began selling Pebble smartwatches in July 2013, and sold out within five days. On December 31, 2014, Pebble sold its one millionth smartwatch. In 2015, Pebble launched the Pebble Time and Time Steel with Kickstarter, raising $20.3 million from over 75,000 backers, breaking records for both on the site. In 2016, Pebble shut down their Time 2 series watches and refunded Kickstarter backers, citing financial issues.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{complexity}} for US persons US {{persons were}} already forbidden by the Securities Act of 1933 {{to make investments}} in US Securities at banks which are not certified inside the USA by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This disallows US persons from participating in <b>any</b> <b>product</b> which may contain US investment products. If a financial institution {{is not able to}} segregate non-US investments from other investment products, a bank may place a total ban upon US persons using their investment products. Since non-US institutions located outside the USA cannot acquire sufficient competence of US law, non-US institutions often find no exemption allowing resident US persons to purchase any financial products from their institution.|$|E

They promoted a range of products, including health aids, dietary supplements (such as coral calcium), baldness remedies, addiction treatments, memory-improvement courses, reading-improvement programs and real estate investment strategies. The FTC took regulatory action against Trudeau, alleging that his broadcasts contained unsubstantiated claims and misrepresentations. In 1998, he was fined. In 2004, he settled a contempt-of-court action arising out of the same cases by agreeing to a settlement that included both payment of a $2 million fine and a ban on further use of infomercials to promote <b>any</b> <b>product</b> other than publications protected by the First Amendment.|$|E
