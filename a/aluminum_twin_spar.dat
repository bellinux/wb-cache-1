50|$|As per the {{original}} Spitfire, the Isaacs Spitfire was a cantilever low-wing monoplane of semi-elliptical planform. The <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> wing {{was built in}} one piece, mainly of spruce with birch plywood skin. The fuselage was of identical construction. The landing gear was non-retractable and included a tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The VFR750F was {{the first}} of the 750 class to have an {{aluminium}} <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> frame, weighing just 14 kg and the nearest thing on the road to the VFR, the GSX-R also had an aluminium frame but it was of a conventional twin cradle design.|$|R
5000|$|Fischer Motor Company is a US-based sport {{motorcycle}} manufacturer. Their MRX 650 is a sport bike {{built around}} a 90-degree V-twin engine and a one-piece, <b>twin</b> <b>spar,</b> <b>aluminum</b> perimeter frame.

50|$|Also called Beam or <b>twin</b> <b>spar,</b> two beams {{wrap around}} {{the engine to}} join the {{steering}} head and swing arm in the shortest distance possible for better rigidity. Beams are usually made of pressed metal (steel/aluminium). The trellis frame employs the same concept but uses welded members to form a trellis instead of pressed metal.|$|R
50|$|The Poite 3 had a three part, low, {{cantilever}} wing, {{built around}} <b>twin</b> <b>spars</b> {{and having a}} high aspect ratio (10.8). There was a rectangular centre-section which filled about {{one quarter of the}} span and almost triangular outer panels which carried light dihedral and tapered in thickness. Its ailerons occupied about half the trailing edges of the outer panels and increased in chord inboard.|$|R
50|$|The ZB50 was {{available}} in 1988 in the United States, Canada and western Europe. Only 3058 were produced for the US market as the bike proved too expensive to mass-produce. The ZB50 was offered as a street & trail alternative to the Z50R, which was geared more towards dirt track riders. The ZB50 {{is characterized by a}} perimeter <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> frame, giving it the appearance of a miniature sportbike.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} a cast <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> aluminium/magnesium alloy with {{thin-walled}} monocoque reinforcements, {{with the engine}} as a fully stressed member manufactured by Benelli for Aprilia. The banana swingarm {{is made out of}} the same polished aluminium alloy {{as the rest of the}} frame. The reason for the swingarm's banana shape is to allow the expansion chambers to run unobstructed under the engine to improve ground clearance in turns.|$|R
50|$|All three 250 cc models {{share the}} same {{four-stroke}} single cylinder engine with a compression of 10:1, DENI carburettor and CDI ignition. Drive is via a six-speed gearbox and it has electric start and disc brakes. The bike features a 4-valve OHC 26 HP single cylinder engine, an aluminium multi <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> trellis frame and T6 aluminium trellis swing-arm. The suspension consists of a telescopic front fork with aluminium dropouts and a mono pre-load adjustable rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|The four cylinder, <b>aluminum,</b> <b>twin</b> {{overhead}} cam engine was designed by ex-Ferrari engineer Aurelio Lampredi. Originally, the AC or first generation featured an 1,438 cc engine, which grew to 1,608 in the second or BC generation. The third generation, or CC, was first officially offered with the 1,592 cc and then 1,756 cc (some early CC left the factory with left over 1,608 cc engines).|$|R
50|$|The Bernard 200s {{were the}} company's only {{attempt to break}} into the growing 1930s market for touring aircraft. They were clean, single-engine, {{cantilever}} high-wing aircraft with a cabin carefully thought out for potential buyers. In plan the wings had straight leading edges and taper on the trailing edges. They were metal structures, built around <b>twin</b> <b>spars</b> and fabric-covered. Full-span ailerons were fitted, with flaps built into the innermost 1.5 m. The tail surfaces were straight-edged, swept only on their leading edges; their control surfaces were all horn balanced and fitted with trim tabs. The square-section, flat-sided fuselage behind the cabin was built around four dural longerons, fabric-covered and tapering rearwards.|$|R
5000|$|The almost {{all-metal}} A-11 was Antonov's first non-wood framed sailplane. [...] It is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane, {{with straight}} tapered wings mostly swept on the trailing edge and set with 1.5° of dihedral but no washout. A single spar with a metal-skinned leading edge forward {{of it and}} fabric covering aft forms most of the span but the curved tips are supported by <b>twin</b> <b>spars.</b> The fabric-covered ailerons are slotted, with set-back hinges and mass balances. They can be drooped together through 8° to act as flaps. Inboard, there are slotted flaps on the trailing edges and spoilers, mounted at mid-chord and quite close to the fuselage, of the gapless kind opening upwards only.|$|R
50|$|Buell led {{the company}} to create {{some of the most}} innovative, usable sport bikes to date under the XB series of Buell Motorcycles. Using inventions like a <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> hollow <b>aluminum</b> frame to house the fuel and create chassis rigidity, a hollow swing arm to house the oil, and an {{underslung}} exhaust pipe, he was able to keep the center of gravity low for optimum handling. During this time, still using the 45 degree V-twin Harley-Davidson engine design, albeit re-worked to produce 30% more horsepower than the standard HD Sportster engine. For the 2008 model year, Buell introduced a new water cooled, 1125cc, 72 degree V-twin engine developed in cooperation with Rotax for the Buell 1125R and 1125CR(2009) producing 146 bhp.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CBR650F is a sport touring motorcycle, {{part of the}} Honda CBR series, [...] {{manufactured}} by Honda for their global market. It was released in 2014 alongside its naked sibling, the CB650F. The bike replaces the 2011-2013 CBR600F. It {{is powered by a}} liquid-cooled four-stroke , DOHC, 16-valve, inline-four engine. Though bike is new from the ground up, it has 19 years of development. The motor which looks a lot like an early model CBR600RR is aimed at more mid range and low end than the typical 600 cc supersport bikes. [...] It has about the same specs as a F2. And like the F2, it has a steel <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> frame. With a wet weight much like the F2 as well at 460 lb.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CBR600F4 was {{produced}} between 1999 and 2000. It {{is the last}} of the CBR600 series of Honda sportbikes to be carbureted. An aluminium <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark plug caps had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5” with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|R
5000|$|Competitor scales a 60 ft cedar spar {{pole and}} returns to the ground. Contestants perform on <b>twin</b> <b>spar</b> poles and they must climb within 240 degrees of the {{sparring}} pole, as marked. Event is strictly against time and begins when the signal [...] "go" [...] is given and ends when the contestant touches the ground after climbing to the 60-foot mark. At the starting signal, contestants must have one foot on the ground and the other foot below the orange line as marked on the sparring pole. The contestant must touch the pole every 15 feet on the descent. The two climbers use spurred climbers and steel-core climbing ropes to scale the spar poles. Only traditional spurs are allowed. Brian Bartow of Grants Pass, Oregon holds the world record of 12.33 seconds in this event.|$|R

25|$|The Schwalbe was {{a single}} bay biplane with thick section, unequal span wooden wings which were built around <b>twin</b> <b>spars</b> and fabric covered. The wings had marked stagger and were braced between the spars with forward leaning, steel tube, N-form interplane struts. The lower wing was {{attached}} directly to the lower fuselage, from which the inner upper wing was braced with an outward leaning pair of parallel struts to the spars and held over the upper fuselage {{by a pair of}} inverted V-struts, one on each side, to the forward spar alone. The wings were straight-tapered in plan, with only slight sweep on the leading edge, out to rounded tips. They also tapered in thickness. The Schwalbe had ailerons on both wings, externally connected with vertical rods. The upper ailerons had large balances to serve both surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The WNF Wn 16, {{originally}} {{built as}} the Meindl-van Nes A.XV (aka Meindl M.15), was an Austrian experimental aircraft {{built in the}} late 1930s for tricycle undercarriage research. It was a swept wing tandem two-seater, with a pusher configuration engine and twin-boom fuselage.Its cantilever low wing had straight edges and 18.33° of sweep at quarter chord. The wing was in three parts, with a <b>twin</b> <b>spar,</b> steel tube framed centre section welded to the central fuselage which supported the tailbooms on its upper surfaces at their outer ends. The ribs were also formed from steel tube. The forward part of the centre section was plywood covered, with fabric aft. The outer wing panels were ply covered, each with a single wooden single spar. There was a split flap over the whole centre section trailing edge and slotted ailerons which filled the trailing edges of the outer panels.|$|R
50|$|The Scheldemusch was a single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings of}} equal span and equal, constant chord. They were built from <b>twin</b> wooden <b>spars,</b> plywood {{covered in the}} vulnerable regions of the leading edge and the underside between the N-form interplane struts. The remaining areas were fabric covered. Both wings had pronounced dihedral; the upper one carried ailerons and leading edge Handley Page slots.|$|R
50|$|The low, {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} M.112 was built in three parts, a tapered centre-section {{which was part of}} the fuselage and trapezoidal outer panels with elliptical tips. Its aspect ratio of 9.5 was high for the time. The outer panels carried mild dihedral and full-span, narrow-chord ailerons. The wings were completely wooden, with <b>twin</b> box <b>spars</b> and alder plywood skin.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} load {{required the}} Multiplace {{to have a}} larger wing area than any of their earlier aircraft, though the wing maintained the general features established previously. Both {{the upper and lower}} wings had the same plan, rectangular apart from their tips, though the upper span was 27% greater than the lower. They were fabric covered and built around <b>twin</b> <b>spars,</b> both of which were ahead of mid-chord, leaving most of the length of each rib unsupported and free to warp for roll control. Because of the large span they were three bay wings, the bays separated by three pairs of parallel, vertical interplane struts; there was no stagger. On each wing another pair of parallel masts leaned outwards from the bases of the outer interplane struts to support the overhang of the upper wing and at the wing roots two more pairs of vertical interplane struts supported both the wing centre section and, just above the lower wing, the fuselage, an arrangement also used to support the short nacelle of the Type B.|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{accomplished}} on first principles determination of dislocation properties. It contains an introduction and three chapters detailing three major accomplishments. First, {{we have used}} first principle calculations to determine the shear strength of an <b>aluminum</b> <b>twin</b> boundary. We find it to be remarkably small ({approx} 17 mJ/m{sup 2 }). This unexpected result is explained and will likely pertain for many other grain boundaries. Second, we have proven that the conventional explanation for finite grain boundary facets is wrong for a particular aluminum grain boundary. Instead of finite facets being stabilized by grain boundary stress, we find them to originate from kinetic effects. Finally we report on a new application of the Frenkel-Kontorova model to understand reconstructions of (100) type surfaces. In addition to the commonly accepted formation of rectangular dislocation arrays, we find numerous other possible solutions to the model including hexagonal reconstructions and a clock-rotated structure...|$|R
5000|$|The MG {{factory in}} Abingdon-On-Thames {{produced}} a Twin-Cam {{variant of the}} pushrod MGA 1600 MkI MG MGA line from 1958 to 1960. The original push rod 1588 cc cast iron block was crowned with a cast <b>aluminum</b> <b>twin</b> cam cylinder head which included one inlet and exhaust valve each, per cylinder. This configuration enabled a cross flow [...] "hemi head" [...] circulation within the combustion chamber, that enabled improved breathing (volumetric efficiency) as well as utilization of enlarged valves and domed pistons. Early versions proved fragile {{on the street and}} in competition due to pre-ignition (detonation), and oil loss, which led to decreasing the compression ratio from 9.1. to 8.3 with redesigned pistons. It was a successful update but sales dropped off so rapidly the company halted Twin Cam production and used the matching chassis for some MGAs, with push rod engines, known as the MGA 1600 MkI and MkII DeLuxe models.|$|R
25|$|The {{low-speed}} concept {{allowed the}} design {{to dispense with}} several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see wave drag) but the low-speed lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular planform allowed the <b>twin</b> wing <b>spars</b> to be single pieces, {{and all of the}} engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The Styx had a {{one piece}} parasol wing with a {{constant}} chord centre-section, straight-tapered outer parts and blunt tips. Thick centrally, it thinned outwards from below beyond, giving light dihedral overall. Its plywood-covered ailerons were towards the tips, {{which could be}} adjusted {{on the ground for}} trimming. The ply-covered wing was built around <b>twin</b> wooden <b>spars</b> and was supported centrally, well above the fuselage, on a fore and aft pair of steel inverted V-struts to those spars. Outward leaning N-struts ran similarly from the fuselage to the wing struts at the ends of the centre-section.|$|R
40|$|Rigid wings usually fly at sub-optimal {{conditions}} generating unnecessary aerodynamic loses {{represented in}} flight time, fuel consumption, and unfavourable operational characteristics. High aspect ratio wings have good range and fuel efficiency, but lack manoeuvrability. On the other hand, low aspect ratio wings fly faster {{and are more}} manoeuvrable, but have poor aerodynamic performance. Span morphing technology allows integrating both features in a single wing design and allows continuously adjusting the wingspan to match the instantaneous flight conditions and mission objectives. This paper develops, a novel span morphing concept, the Gear driveN Autonomous <b>Twin</b> <b>Spar</b> (GNATSpar) for a mini-UAV. The GNATSpar {{can be used to}} achieve span extensions up to 100 % but for demonstration purposes it is used here to achieve span extensions up to 20 % to reduce induced drag and increase flight endurance. The GNATSpar is superior to conventional telescopic and articulated structures as it uses the space available in the opposite sides of the wing instead of relying on overlapping structures and bearings. In addition, it has a self-locking actuation mechanism due to the low lead angle of the driving worm gear. Following the preliminary aero-structural sizing of the concept, a physical prototype is developed and tested in the 7 ?× 5 ? wind-tunnel at the University of Southampton. Finally, benefits and drawbacks of the design are highlighted and analysed...|$|R
50|$|The Caudron C.570 was {{primarily}} designed {{to fill a}} gap in the types of aircraft available to French armed forces, that of a troop-carrier, though it could take on other roles. It was a low wing cantilever monoplane with wings in three parts, a 7.80 m span rectangular centre section and outer trapezoidal panels, ending in rounded tips. The wings were built around <b>twin</b> box <b>spars</b> made of spruce and plywood. The central section had an aluminium frame and light metal skin; the outer panels were ply-covered. Multi-section ailerons filled more than half the span of the outer panels' trailing edges.|$|R
50|$|Ole Evinrude {{continued}} designing motors {{during this}} time and developed a new engine that made extensive use of lightweight <b>aluminum.</b> His new <b>twin</b> cylinder design weighed one third less than the Evinrude Motor Co.'s best selling (single cylinder) model and produced 50% more power.|$|R
50|$|Beyond a metal framed centre-section {{the wings}} were all wood, built around <b>twin</b> box <b>spars</b> and plywood covered. They were {{trapezoidal}} in plan out to rounded tips, with long, narrow-chord ailerons each {{divided into two}} sections. The wings had about 3.5° of dihedral, partly achieved by airfoil section thinning outboard. The wing centre-section was widest from leading edge to around the forward spar, then angled inwards in plan until it almost reached the fuselage edge, following it to the trailing edge. The outer wings were folded in two stages, first rotating them around a pivot on the forward spar until the trailing edge was upright, then hinging the wings back {{along the side of}} the fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|The E-40, one {{of several}} Praga trainer designs, was a single-bay biplane with open, tandem cockpits. The swept wings had <b>twin</b> wooden <b>spars</b> and a mixture of plywood and fabric covering. Ailerons were fitted to the lower wing and the upper wing had a cut-out on its {{trailing}} edge to enhance visibility from the forward cockpit. The N-form interplane struts were steel and the bay braced with [...] wires. A pair of vertical N-form struts joined the wing centre section to the upper fuselage. The fixed tail surfaces were wood framed and plywood covered; the tailplane was strut braced from below. Elevators and rudder were fabric covered over steel frames. The rudder had a trim tab.|$|R
2500|$|The AF-2 had a high, {{parallel}} chord, two part wing {{with straight}} edges, semi-elliptical tips and about 6° of sweep. It had a largely wooden structure with <b>twin</b> box <b>spars</b> and was fabric covered. The wing was braced {{on each side}} {{with a pair of}} parallel, backward leaning, faired struts from the tips of the sponsons to the wing spars. A pusher configuration engine was mounted on the rear wing spar within a central rectangular wing cut-out, with its propeller disk immediately behind the wing trailing edge. The AF-2 fitted was an [...] Walter Vega five-cylinder radial engine, though there were plans to install other types in the [...] power range. Its fuel tank was between the spars, immediately ahead of the gravity fed engine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{continued}} rapid {{development in the}} increasingly competitive international voiturette class, {{and the introduction of}} the Alfa Romeo 158 and ERA B- and C-type models, forced the Maserati brothers into designing a new, square-bore, inline-4-cylinder engine. This new engine developed 30–50bhp more than the previous inline-6, the increase mostly achieved through an increase to four valves per cylinder, coupled to the use of a more powerful supercharger and a small increase in the compression ratio. Following customary Maserati practice, the engine was mounted into a chassis design almost identical to that of the 4CL's predecessor: the Maserati 6CM. Conventional in its architecture, <b>twin</b> box-section <b>spars</b> ran the length of the car joined, ladder-fashion, by smaller cross members, although the 4CL design did incorporate more aluminium componentry than its forebear. Although near-identical in its wheelbase, the 4CL's track was a full [...] wider than the 6CM, and sat lower thanks to repositioned spring hangers.|$|R
