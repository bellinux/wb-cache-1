Consequently, working from an interdisciplinary approach of criminal law as a science integrated to other legal and non-legal areas of knowledge, in order to develop a comprehensive analysis that contributes to academic discussions about the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility,</b> constitutional study and medical activity practice. This product of research will show reflections and conclusions obtained from the analysis of the existent legal regulation about the availability of the protected legal right of life when practicing euthanasia (as described above). Additionally, we will see how the latter conduct constitutes a case of exempt criminal responsibility under the specified condition of “victim’s consent”, meaning that life is a disposable legal right when it competes, in the described factual circumstance, with the human dignity, applying the test of proportionality in strict sense...|$|E
40|$|Written {{from the}} {{viewpoint}} of two forensic psychiatrists, {{the purpose of this article}} is to dramatize the criminological implications of a neurological disorder called the episodic dyscontrol syndrome. They argue that this syndrome produces temporary insanity and must be recognized by criminal courts as a total <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> in defendants diagnosed by forensic psychiatrists as suffering from it. The authors of this study examined and evaluated a young man, who had committed a brutal and senseless crime, and found the major criteria for an episodic dyscontrol syndrome to be present. A functional, and probably a structural brain defect were also present (as a child the defendant had been often brutally beaten by his father, and had subsequently suffered a head trauma in an accident, so that the case fit the criteria of an epileptic dyscontrol). The psychiatrists testified that the defendant should be found not guilty by reason of insanity because of this mental defect. The jury, in its verdict, expressed qualified support of this view. The study concludes that many explosive individuals do not control their violent actions because they cannot: recognition of the organic dysfunction is crucial and can lead to effective treatment and proper disposition. Advances in the area of organic dyscontrol should save many defendants on trial for violent crimes from lengthy and needless incarceration in penal institutions, and should secure for them the psychiatric treatment they need.

40|$|The age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> {{children}} {{is important because}} of its relevance to children life. The minimum age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> {{children is}} the lowest statutory age at which children may potentially be held criminally liable for infringements of the penal law in a given country. Thus, the area of children's rights includes the issue on age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> children in international instruments as international standard.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the tension between {{government}} protestations that youth justice policy is evidence-led and what the evidence implies in the context of the age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a conceptual analysis of government policy and the evidence base. Findings – The paper concludes that the current low age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> in England and Wales can be understood as a manifestation of the influence of underclass theory on successive governments. Research limitations/implications – The paper is not based on primary research. Practical implications – The arguments adduced help to explain the reluctance of government to countenance any increase in the age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Social implications – The analysis might help inform approaches adopted by youth justice policy makers, practitioners and academics with an interest in seeking a rise in the age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Originality/value – The paper offers an original analysis of government intransigence on an important social issue...|$|R

It looks firstly at criminal capacity – what it is that needs to be understood fairly to hold anyone criminally responsible - and draws on material from developmental psychology and neuroscience, as well as looking at the child’s lived experience, to provide some evidence that the young may, without fault, lack this capacity. It then examines the use of age generally in law, and the age <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>responsibility</b> within this. Next, it considers existing lack of capacity defences – nonage; diminished responsibility; insanity (or mental disorder) and <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> mens rea - to consider their suitability for use by young and immature defendants. Finally, it presents a proposal for the form of the new defence, taking into account the need for balance with the public interest in conviction of the guilty.
