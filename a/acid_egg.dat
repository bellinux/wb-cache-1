50|$|The terms <b>acid</b> <b>egg</b> and {{montejus}} (or monte-jus) {{are sometimes}} used interchangeably {{to refer to}} a device with no moving parts formerly used instead of a pump in order to transfer difficult liquids. The principle is that a strong vessel containing the liquid is pressurized with gas or steam, forcing the liquid into a pipe (usually vertical upwards) thereby causing flow. When the liquid has been transferred, the pressure is released and more liquid is put in via gravity. It is thus cyclic in operation. The same principle has been used to lift water and called an air displacement pump or intermittent gas-lift pump, and has been applied to pumping oil up from the formation.Its use has largely been superseded by modern pumps, but it is still used sometimes for special tasks.|$|E

This experiment aimed at evaluating possible changes in the fatty acid profile of the eggs of layers fed diets supplemented with linseed and soybean oils. The experiment was performed using 192 29 week-old laying hens, distributed in a completely randomized design, into six treatments with four replicates of eight birds each. Treatments consisted of a control diet (no vegetable oil) and diets including 2 % of vegetable oil. Linseed oil replaced 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 % soybean oil in the diets, corresponding to 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 % of linseed oil in the diet. A pool of two egg yolks from each treatment was submitted to lipid extraction and fatty acid methylation, and subsequent gas chromatography (GC) analysis to detect seven fatty acids. Saturated (myristic and palmitic) fatty acids concentration was affected by lipid dietary source, with the lowest concentration in birds were fed feeds containing linseed oil.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} {{colorimetric method}} for quantitative determination of phosphatidylcholine is de-scribed. The procedure is very simple, not involving lipid extraction or acid digestion, {{and can be}} used for direct estimation of phosphatidylcholine in blood plasma. The method depends on the formation of a stable hydrophobic complex of phosphatidylcholine with tetrathiocyanatocobaltate. Similar complexes are formed by other species of diacylglycero-phosphoryl esters, but the absorbance coefficients of these complexes are only 10 to 20 % of that of the phosphatidylcholine complex. Phospholipids without unsaturated fatty acids, such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, do not form hydrophobic complexes. Lysophosphatidyl-choline and sphingolipids also do not form similar complexes. For quantitative measurement, phospholipids in biological materials are usually extracted with an organic solvent and digested with acid, and then the resulting inorganic phosphate is measured colorimetrically. This routine procedure is labori-ous and time-consuming. Recently, direct color-imetric methods avoiding acid digestion have been devised, but these methods are still not satisfactory because of the complicated treatments necessary before the chromogenic reaction (7, 2) and they are rather insensitive (3). In the present work, we describe a colorimetric assay of phosphatidyl-choline based on the formation of a stable hydro-phobic complex with tetrathiocyanatocobaltate.

One hundred and sixty 30 week-old laying birds were randomly divided into 4 groups and subjected to four levels of acetic acid (5 birds in each of the 8 replicates/treatment) and fed ad libitum a commercial layers mash ration (17 % protein and 2800 Kcal/Kg metabolizable energy). The birds were maintained under 14 h light and 8 h dark cycles and offered water and feed ad libitum. Egg production, egg weight; length; diameter; specific gravity; shell weight; shell thickness and colour, yolk, albumen unit, albumen height and colour were daily recorded for 70 consecutive days. The drinking acetic acid significantly improved egg production, external and internal egg quality parameters. Acetic acid supplementation at 600, 400 and 200 ppm groups significantly (p< 0. 01) increased average egg production by about 20, 15 and 10 % compared with the control group. An increase in the supplemental acetic acid produced a linear increase in external egg qualities such as egg weight (p< 0. 01), egg length (p< 0. 05), egg diameter (p< 0. 05) and egg shell colour (L*, a*, b*) (p< 0. 05). Internal egg quality was also significantly (p< 0. 01) improved by increasing the organic acid supplementation. Albumen height, yolk pH and Haugh unit were increased with increasing acetic acid concentrations in the drinking water. The most marked results were obtained with 600 ppm acetic acid supplementation. This level may be considered as a protective management practice in commercial egg production that reduces the negative effects of heat stress.

Biological test using Rattus norvegicus L rat showed that either fresh and processed long chain fatty <b>acid</b> <b>egg</b> decreased plasma cholesterol. The highest and the lowest decreases of cholesterol content {{were found in the}} group consumed RSM (8. 64 %) and GM (1. 77 %) for normal rat; and control (46. 3 %) followed by RSM (44. 53 %) and GM (24. 86 %), respectively. To maintain normal cholesterol and decrease cholesterol content of cholesterolemian, the omega egg should be consumed in fresh or half boiled egg...|$|E

40|$|The lysis {{of human}} {{erythrocytes}} by Staphylococcus aureus delta-toxin proceeded without a lag and was {{directly proportional to}} toxin concentration and temperature of incubation. Lysis was complete within 8 min. Addition of saturated, straight-chain fatty acids of 13 to 19 carbons increased the activity of delta-toxin, whereas those with 21 to 23 carbons were inhibitory. Palmitic acid was the fatty acid most active in augmenting delta-toxin, but its effect could be abolished by the simultaneous addition of either tricosanoic <b>acid</b> or <b>egg</b> lecithin...|$|R

40|$|Two {{hundred and}} forty White Leghorn laying hens at 48 th week of age were {{randomly}} divided into 24 experimental units. These experimental units were allotted to eight treatment groups which were fed diets with 0, 2, 3 and 4 % canola oil with 3000 or 10000 IU vitamin A/kg of diet (4 x 2 factorial design), {{for a period}} of 12 weeks in order to observe the effects of feeding canola oil and vitamin A on the fatty <b>acid</b> profile of <b>egg</b> yolks. Two eggs per replicate were collected at the end of trial and analyzed for fatty <b>acid</b> contents of <b>egg</b> yolks.

40|$|A {{characterization}} of the structural alterations induced by melittin in model-membranes of dioleoylphosphatidic <b>acid</b> and <b>egg</b> phosphatidylglycerol is presented, based {{on the use of}} 31 P-NMR, freeze-fracture electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. In accordance with earlier findings on the cardiolipinmelittin system, melittin is found to have an inverted phase inducing effect on these negatively charged lipids, in contrast to the influence on zwitterionic phospholipids. In phosphatidic acid this is expressed in the formation of an HII phase; in phosphatidylglycerol a less ordered, non-lamellar structure with low water content is adopted...|$|R

Since CLA may soon {{be used as an}} animal feed supplement, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine if feeding chickens tallow from beef cattle fed a CLA-supplemented diet would induce embryo mortality and cause changes in egg quality.

The lipospheres (diameter 75 - 85 nm) consisted mainly of stearic <b>acid</b> and <b>egg</b> lecithin; pilocarpine base was incorporated as ion pair with mono-octylphosphate, monodecylphosphate and monohexadecylphosphate. The following parameters were investigated: stability constants (β) and lipophilicity of the ion pairs, size, polydispersity and drug content of the lipospheres, pilocarpine release in vitro. The preparations might constitute a promising vehicle for sustained ocular delivery of pilocarpine...|$|R
