40|$|Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) in its {{broadest}} {{sense is}} often described as an attempt by educators to provide a schooling-to-work pathway to support the employability of graduates. It is a construction by educational practitioners and <b>associating</b> <b>employers.</b> The cooperative arrangements, between these groups, have shaped programs of study at many tertiary education institutions for {{the best part of the}} last century. However, the approach sanctions a labour force imperative for education which is not consistent with the broader career-based education views expressed in public policy. In this paper we propose that any understanding of a WIL philosophy incorporates a learner environment for individual action learning and institutional active learning as an initiative that addresses six educational imperatives: workforce readiness; a professional development culture (both individual and workforce related); international relevance; life-long learning, knowledge transference; human and social potential. These imperatives we have derived from published mission statements, public policies, and institutional governance expressions, e. g. Australian government policies (1975 to 2005), OECD reports (2202, 2003) and the international symposia on career development and public policy held in Australia (2006) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three separate}} studies designed to examine perspectives on employment {{for individuals with}} disabilities from employers and educators. First, a literature review {{was conducted on the}} studies published in the past decade to provide an update of employers' attitudes toward employees with disabilities. Investigated factors included studies? methodologies, research procedures, and employer characteristics. Research findings indicated that employers increasingly showed favorable attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and demonstrated willingness to hire workers with disabilities. Employers' previous experience with workers with disabilities was <b>associated</b> with positive <b>employer</b> attitudes. Secondly, 168 employers and 105 educators were surveyed regarding their perspectives on valued employability skills for entry-level employees with and without disabilities. The second study primarily focused on examining employers' perspectives of the most valued employability skill areas and specific employability skills as well as <b>associated</b> <b>employer</b> factors (i. e., respondents' genders and types of business/industry). Differences between employers' expectations for employees with disabilities and for those without disabilities were analyzed. The study results presented findings on important employability skills and discrepancies between rating for employees with and without disabilities were discussed, and reported the effects of respondent factors. Lastly, the third study investigated and compared both employers and educators' expectations on important employability skills. Study identified differences of ratings on important employability skills between employers and educators. Study also found out how they viewed differently on employability skills for employees with and without disabilities. To sum up, this dissertation revealed updated trends of employers' attitude toward workers with disabilities. It also identified critical employability skills viewed by employers and educators for entry-level workers with disabilities. The comparisons between employers and educators' perspectives provided information on what schools should include or emphasize in vocational preparation programs to prepare students with disabilities for future employment...|$|R

30|$|It {{tends to}} be the case that high-cost {{apprenticeships}} are <b>associated</b> with <b>employers</b> that have a demand-led approach, whereas the low-cost ones are associated mainly with the supply-led one. This means, in practice, that many employers, where they are engaged in level 2 apprenticeships are particularly sensitive to the net costs they are likely to face in delivering that training and the capacity of the training provider to deliver and structure training such that many costs the employer might face are offset in some way. As the Government moves to creating a more demand-led approach to delivering apprenticeships, the aim is to ensure that the employer meets proportionately more of the overall cost of training than currently (Leitch 2006; Richard 2012; Hogarth et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{reciprocity}} {{within the}} exchange {{relationship between the}} employee and employer using the psychological contract framework. Specifically, we examine the bi-directionality of the norm of reciprocity. We hypothesize {{that there will be}} a positive relationship between perceived employer obligations, fulfilment of obligations and employee obligations and fulfilment. In addition, we hypothesize that employee fulfilment of obligations will be positively <b>associated</b> with perceived <b>employer</b> obligations. Using a longitudinal survey of 1400 public sector employees and 84 managers, our findings suggest that there is broad agreement between the two parties regarding the norm of reciprocity that governs the relationship. We found that perceived employer obligations at time 1 is positively associated with employees’ fulfilment of obligations at time 2 and perceived employer fulfilment of obligations at time 1 is positively related to employee obligations and fulfilment of obligations at time 2. Furthermore, we found that employee fulfilment of obligations at time 1 is positively <b>associated</b> with perceived <b>employer</b> obligations at time 2. Overall, these findings provide initial empirical support for the norm of reciprocity in exchange relationships from both the perspective of employees as well as managers, as employer representatives...|$|R

Because the Equal Pay Act 1970 preceded other legislation, {{and so did the}} TFEU article 157, {{there has always been a}} separate body of rules. It is not entirely clear why this should continue, particularly because in several respects it is harder to bring equal pay claims on grounds of gender than for other protected characteristics, meaning that the task of closing the gender pay gap is frustrated compared to race, sexual orientation or other grounds. First, a claim must relate to [...] "pay", concept which is generally construed widely to encompass any kind of remuneration for work, as well as sick pay or for maternity leave. Second, under the EA 2010 section 79, a comparator must be real, and employed by the same <b>employer,</b> or an <b>associated</b> <b>employer,</b> and at the same establishment, or a different establishment if common terms apply. It is usually harder to find a real comparator than imagine a hypothetical one. Third, under EA 2010 section 65, the claimant must be doing [...] "broadly similar" [...] work to the comparator, or work [...] "rated as equivalent", or work which is of [...] "equal value". These criteria, which at their broadest focus on the [...] "value" [...] of labour, make explicit what a court must take into account, but also potentially constrain the court in a way that the open ended test for indirect discrimination does not. Fourth, under section 128 there is a time limit of six months to bring a claim, but unlike the three-month time limit for other discrimination claims it cannot be extended at the court's discretion. However, equal pay claims do import an [...] "equality clause" [...] into the claimant's contract of employment. This allows a claim to be pursued in the High Court as well as a Tribunal.

We show that performance expectancies have the strongest positive effect on intention, while perceived threats negatively impact intention. Finally, behavioural intention was positively <b>associated</b> with <b>employer</b> attractiveness, which leads to clear indications for companies considering establishing corporate BYOD programs.

It {{is based on}} a qualitative study in which face-to-face interviews were conducted among 30 employees.

The study identifies rhetorical strategies as a means for employees to construct an understanding of corporate environmentalism, and of {{whether or not it is}} a part of their organization’s responsibilities.
