5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, <b>a</b> <b>linear</b> walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker. The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
