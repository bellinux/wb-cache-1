25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors are polarized capacitors {{because of their}} <b>anodization</b> principle. They can only be operated with DC voltage applied with the correct polarity.

50|$|<b>Anodization</b> of {{titanium}} rings is {{the process}} whereby an oxide film is formed {{on the surface of}} the titanium via an electrolytic process to create color. In the case of titanium rings, this process is performed after it is machined into shape. Oxidation changes the ordinary titanium color (generally silver, depending on composition and processing) and increases corrosion-resistance. The <b>anodization</b> process is extremely simple to carry out: the piece is immersed in an electrolyte, cola is popularly used, and a DC voltage, around 100V, is applied. The voltage controls the thickness, and thus the colour, of the <b>anodization.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fabrication of porous silicon may {{range from}} initial {{formation}} through stain-etching or by forming an <b>anodization</b> cell. Drying, storage of porous silicon, and surface modification are needed afterwards. If <b>anodization</b> {{in an aqueous}} solution is used to form microporous silicon, the material is commonly treated in ethanol immediately after fabrication, to avoid damage to the structure that results due to the stresses of the capillary effect of the aqueous solution.|$|E
50|$|Alumina nanobottles were {{produced}} in one step by electrochemical <b>anodization</b> of aluminium foil in phosphoric acid: Pores were etched in Al by the acid, and their inner surface was oxidized in the process. Then the Al matrix, {{but not the}} oxidized aluminium, was etched away by the acid. The transition from pore creation to Al etching was achieved by controlling the pulse profile of the <b>anodization</b> voltage. The entire synthesis took about 2 hours. The resulting nanobottles had a volume of ca. 10−7 liters.|$|E

50|$|One {{method of}} {{introducing}} pores in silicon {{is through the}} use of an <b>anodization</b> cell. A possible <b>anodization</b> cell employs platinum cathode and silicon wafer anode immersed in hydrogen fluoride (HF) electrolyte. Recently, inert diamond cathodes are used to avoid metallic impurities in the electrolyte and inert diamond anodes form an improved electrical back plate contact to the silicon wafers. Corrosion of the anode is produced by running electric current through the cell. It is noted that the running of constant DC is usually implemented to ensure steady tip-concentration of HF resulting in a more homogeneous porosity layer although pulsed current is more appropriate for the formation of thick silicon wafers bigger than 50 µm.|$|E

The product is then heated at 550 °C for several hours in air to remove the carbon core and form TiO2 nanocrystals. When chiral carbon nanofibers are used as templates, the resulting TiO2 fibers are also chiral, i.e., they respond differently to left and right-hand circularly polarized light.

In the case of unthreaded holes that accept fixed-diameter pins or rods, a slightly oversized hole to allow for the dimension change may be appropriate.Depending on the alloy and thickness of the anodized coating, the same may have a significantly negative effect on fatigue life.
