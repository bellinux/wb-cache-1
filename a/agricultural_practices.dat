5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, and changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> have caused local population declines, this widespread and abundant species is not threatened globally. Climate change may present a long-term threat, by shifting the necessary Alpine habitat to higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|In intensively farmed {{areas where}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> {{appear to have}} made cropped land unsuitable, gardens are an {{important}} breeding habitat. In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that habitat making up only 2% of the total area. The remaining nests were in woodlands (1% of total area).|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} 1776, a number of events led to a drastic change in the diet of the American colonists.

5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> which have led to population decline, some local extirpation, and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The red-billed chough, which derived its common name from the jackdaw, was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint Thomas Becket and Cornwall. The red-billed chough has been depicted on postage stamps of a few countries, including the Isle of Man, with four different stamps, and The Gambia, where the bird does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Between the 16th {{century and}} the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large {{increase}} in agricultural productivity and net output. New <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> like enclosure, mechanization, four-field crop rotation to maintain soil nutrients, and selective breeding enabled an unprecedented population growth to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up {{a significant percentage of}} the workforce, and thereby helped drive the Industrial Revolution. The productivity of wheat went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to around 30 bushels by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.|$|E

5|$|In the Maasai Mara game reserve, {{there is}} a {{non-migratory}} population of blue wildebeest which had dwindled from about 119,000 animals in 1977 to about 22,000 in 1997. The reason for the decline {{is thought to be}} the increasing competition between cattle and wildebeest for a diminishing area of grazing land as a result of changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> and possibly fluctuations in rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} have {{established}} breeding populations in areas {{to which they}} have been introduced by humans. Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird. Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity. Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> created suitable new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} such monasteries an {{expression}} of David's undoubted piety, but they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, and provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices.</b> Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's most important sources of sheep wool.|$|E

5|$|Populations have {{declined}} {{in recent decades}} in western Europe, including the British Isles, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Italy. The yellowhammer is a red-list (severely declining) species in Ireland and the UK. In eastern Europe, numbers appear to be stable, although the trend in Russia is unknown. Changes to <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> {{are thought to be}} responsible for reduced breeding densities. The introduced population in New Zealand has been very successful, with breeding densities much higher than in the UK.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the rules of coursing in Great Britain (where it is regulated by the National Coursing Club) and Irish coursing which has been organised by the Irish Coursing Club since 1916. Because hares are not plentiful {{in all parts of}} the island of Ireland, mainly due to modern <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> coursing clubs are licensed by the Irish government to net 70–75 hares for their events. The hares are then transported in boxes to the coursing venue where they are kept for up to eight weeks and trained to be coursed.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{stars have}} been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices.</b> The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
