40|$|Abstract Introduction: Dialysis {{affects the}} quality of life of {{hemodialysis}} patients due on idrasis in physical activities, psychological factors, and social adaptability. Predominant indicator for assessing the adequacy of dialysis, considered the Kt / V (clearance time/volume of distribution). According to international guidelines, the price which shows adequate dialysis is > 1. 2. Aim: The aim of the present study was the association of quality of life of hemodialysis patients with adequate dialysis. Material and Methods: To evaluate {{the quality of}} life of hemodialysis patients used the questionnaire KDQOL-SF weighted in the Greek language and the Greek egkyropoiimeno population. Excluded from the study patients with a speaking disability, those who were comatose, aliens, and <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> 3 hours/ 2 times / week. For data processing, used the statistical package SPSS ver. 17. Results: Based on the statistical analysis t-test results showed respect to the route of vascular access that patients with graft (31, 6 %) had a higher clearance rate adequacy, as well as patients undergoing hemodialysis with high permeability (high-flux) filters (35, 8 %) and <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> with hemodiafiltration (35, 8 %). According to the statistical criterion pearson's r and multivariate analysis of linear regression, statistically significant difference was only between Kt / V and forefinger encouraging staff and p = 0, 032 and p = 0, 015 respectively. Conclusions: The conclusions drawn from this study showed that there was no correlation between quality of life and dialysis adequacy, but only with the index of encouraging staff...|$|R

40|$|In {{patients}} with advanced renal failure or <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis,</b> protein energy wasting (PEW) is a frequently occurring complication that {{is associated with}} increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Fewer data are available for patients after transplantation. In this article, the available data on nutritional status after kidney transplantation is reviewed. It was also found that signs of PEW and microinflammation in patients undergoing kidney transplantation are associated with both impaired transplantation outcomes and decreased patient survival. Data are lacking on nutritional support and outcomes after transplantation. Only 1 study revealed a possible relationship between healthier eating habits and better outcomes in patients who have undergone transplantation. More data support the notion that sufficient physical exercise improves graft survival and patient outcome after kidney transplantation.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mor-tality increase with {{the severity of}} kidney disease, reaching 30 times higher mortality rates in dialysis patients compared with the general population. Although dyslipidemia is a well-established CV risk factor in the general population, the relationship between lipid disorders and CV risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear. Despite the clear evidence that statins {{reduce the risk of}} athero-sclerotic events and death from cardiac causes in individuals without CKD, the use of statins in patients with kidney disease is significantly less frequent. For a long time, one of the explanations was the lack of a prospective, randomized, controlled study designed specifically to CKD patients.

BackgroundAging-associated changes in physiology and metabolism may alter the risk and benefit of therapeutic strategies from that observed in younger people. MethodsWe performed a pre-specified analysis of 30 -day and 1 -year outcomes in 4 age groups, overall and <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ResultsOf 13, 819 patients in the ACUITY trial, 3, 655 (26. 4 %) were < 55 years of age, 3, 940 (28. 5 %) were 55 to 64 years of age, 3, 783 (27. 4 %) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 2, 441 (17. 7 %) were ≥ 75 years of age. Older patients had more cardiovascular risk factors and had a higher acuity at presentation. Patients age ≥ 75 years treated with bivalirudin alone had similar ischemic outcomes, but significantly lower rates of bleeding compared with those treated with heparin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors overall and in the PCI subset. The number needed to treat with bivalirudin alone to avoid 1 major bleeding event was lower {{in this age group}} (23 overall and 16 for PCI-treated patients) than in any other. ConclusionsIschemic and bleeding complications after NSTE-ACS increase with age. Although ischemic event rates are not statistically different with either bivalirudin alone or a heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, bleeding complications are significantly less frequent with bivalirudin alone. Because of the substantial risk of bleeding in patients age ≥ 75 years, the number needed to treat to avoid 1 major bleeding event using bivalirudin alone was the lowest in the elderly group, especially <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> PCI.

Over 30 covariates were considered. A two-compartment model with first-order elimination provided the best fit for data on daptomycin concentrations in plasma over time. In the final population PK model, daptomycin plasma clearance (CL) was a function of renal function, body temperature, and sex. Of these factors, renal function contributed most significantly to interindividual variability. CL varied linearly with the estimated creatinine clearance. CL among dialysis subjects was approximately one-third that of healthy subjects (0. 27 versus 0. 81 liter/h). CL in females was 80 % that in males; however, in clinical trials, the outcome was not affected by sex and therefore this effect is not considered clinically meaningful. The relationship with body temperature {{should be interpreted cautiously}} since the analysis included {{only a limited number of}} subjects who were hyperthermic. The volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (V 2) and intercompartmental clearance (Q) were linearly related to body weight. V 2 increased approximately twofold in the presence of an acute infection. No factors were identified that significantly impacted V 1.

40|$|Healthy diet {{is highly}} important, {{especially}} {{in patients with}} chronic kidney disease (CKD). Proper nutrition provides the energy to perform everyday activities, prevents infection, builds muscle, and helps to prevent kidney disease from getting worse. However, what does a proper diet mean for a CKD patient? Nutrition requirements differ depending {{on the level of}} kidney function and the presence of co-morbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The diet of CKD patients should help to slow the rate of progression of kidney failure, reduce uremic toxicity, decrease proteinuria, maintain good nutritional status, and lower the risk of kidney disease-related secondary complications (cardiovascular disease, bone disease, and hypertension). It has been suggested that plant proteins may exert beneficial effects on blood pressure, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate, as well as results in milder renal tissue damage when compared to animal proteins. The National Kidney Foundation recommends vegetarianism, or part-time vegetarian diet as being beneficial to CKD patients. Their recommendations are supported by the results of studies demonstrating that a plant-based diet may hamper the development or progression of some complications of chronic kidney disease, such as heart disease, protein loss in urine, and the progression of kidney damage. However, there are sparse reports suggesting that a vegan diet is not appropriate for CKD patients and <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> due to the difficulty in consuming enough protein and in maintaining proper potassium and phosphorus levels.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{kidney disease}} is an {{important}} public health threat. Such patients present high morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, with {{low quality of life}} and survival, and also high expenditure resulting from the treatment. Arterial hypertension is both a cause and a complication of kidney disease; also, arterial hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease among patients with kidney diseases. There is some evidence that exercise interventions may be beneficial to chronic kidney disease patients, but previous studies included only end-stage patients, i. e. <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis.</b> This study aims to evaluate the effect of exercise on kidney function, quality of life and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease among non-diabetic chronic hypertensive kidney disease patients who are not <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis.</b> Methods The participants will be located through screening hypertensive patients attended within the public healthcare network in Pelotas, a city in south of Brazil. Eligible individuals will be those with glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 59 [*]ml/min x 1. 73 [*]m 2. The randomization will be done in fixed-size blocks of six individuals such that 75 participants will be allocated to each group. At baseline, information on demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, anthropometric, blood pressure and quality-of-life variables will be collected, and laboratory tests will be performed. The intervention will consist of three weekly physical exercise sessions lasting 60 – 75 [*]minutes each, with a total duration of 16 [*]weeks. The outcomes will be the kidney function progression rate, quality of life, blood pressure, lipid profile, hemoglobin level, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein level, and ankle-arm index.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is associated with osteoclastic bone resorption. We aimed to examine whether the use of RAS inhibitors reduces the incidence of fracture in hemodialysis patients. This was a multicenter, 3 -year, prospective, observational study. From 2008 to 2011, maintenance hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (N = 3, 276) treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) /angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) at baseline were followed for a mean of 2. 7 years. The association between the use of ACEI/ARB and hospitalization rate owing to fracture was examined by using Cox regression models. Effect modifications by the severity of secondary hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] level), sex, and systolic blood pressure were also examined. The incidence proportion of fracture-related hospitalization was 5. 42 % throughout the observation period. ACEI/ARB use was associated with a lower rate of fracture-related hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 65; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 45 - 0. 92).

MethodsA total of 2198 CAD patients who underwent PCI, except for <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> or who died within 7 days after angioplasty, were analyzed from the ICAS (Ibaraki Cardiovascular Assessment Study) multicenter registry. Analyzed subjects were divided into 2 groups according to statin pretreatment: statin pretreatment (n = 839) and non-statin pretreatment (n = 1359). Selection bias of statin pretreatment was adjusted by propensity score-matching method: pretreatment statin (n = 565) and non-statin pretreatment (n = 565). CI-AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 25 % or 0. 5 mg/dl from baseline within 1 week of contrast medium exposure. ResultsA total of 192 (8. 7 %) patients developed CI-AKI. No significant differences were observed in baseline patient characteristics between the statin and non-statin pretreatment groups after propensity score matching. In the propensity score-matched groups, the incidence of CI-AKI was significantly lower in patients with statin pretreatment than in those without statin pretreatment (3. 5 % vs. 10. 6 %, odds ratio [OR]: 0. 31, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 18 – 0. 52, P < 0. 001).

Materials and Methods: The 43 subjects {{included in this study}} were patients who had been <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> because of end-stage renal disease or had undergone kidney transplantation. The patients were diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) during follow-up and underwent radical nephrectomy from May 1996 to December 2010. Their medical records were retrospectively analyzed as part of the study. Results: In the transplantation group, the renal replacement therapy period averaged 54 months, and the period from transplantation to RCC averaged 119 months (range, 0 to 264 months). In the dialysis group, RCC was observed after an average of 124 months (range, 2 to 228 months) of dialysis, and nephrectomy was then conducted. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) was found more frequently in the dialysis group, and it had a statistically relevant effect on the occurrence of RCC by comparison with the transplantation group (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Although the incidence rate of ACKD was significantly higher in the dialysis group among patients undergoing surgery for RCC, cancer was found even without ACKD development in some transplant recipients. Considering that the transplant recipients also <b>underwent</b> <b>dialysis,</b> an informative prospective study will be necessary to determine whether other immunosuppressive agents besides ACKD may function as a cancer risk factor.

Of the 101 patients included, 31 (30. 7 %) had pruritus at the time of examination. Patients with pruritus were significantly older than those without pruritus (P= 0. 0027). Pruritus tended to be more prevalent in patients <b>undergoing</b> <b>dialysis</b> 3 times a week than in <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> daily <b>dialysis,</b> but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0. 0854). Lower transferrin saturation levels were found in patients with pruritus than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0144). C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in patients with pruritus than in those without pruritus (P= 0. 0013). There was no significant difference between the groups in the levels of the other inflammatory biomarkers measured. However, there was a tendency toward a correlation between the levels of alpha- 1 -glycoprotein and the intensity of pruritus (P= 0. 0834). Our results suggest a possible relationship of the inflammatory response upregulation to pruritus. Additionally, there was a positive relationship between pruritus and iron deficiency, possibly associated with inflammatory elevation of hepcidin. A better understanding of the factors implicated in the genesis of pruritus related to end-stage renal disease is crucial in the development of more effective treatments for this symptom...|$|R

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{has emerged as}} the commonest cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) over the past three decades. It accounts for 30 % to 50 % of patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT); nearly 80 % of patients are managed with hospital-based hemodialysis. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is endemic among patients on RRT, especially <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> maintenance hemodialysis (HD) (1, 2). Therefore, both the disorders are prevalent and coexist among patients with ESRD and frequently cause complications in a considerable majority of the affected patients resulting in poor outcomes. A number of studies have demonstrated a higher prevalence of type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}} in patients with HCV in comparison to general population (2 - 6). Mehta et al., in a recent epidemiological study based on data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), provided compelling data for the distinctive association between chronic HCV infection and type 2 diabetes mellitus (3). In this report, anti-HCV positive subjects (> 40 years old) had a significantly higher prevalence (OR= 3. 77) of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with HCV-negative subjects. Likewise, Egyptian investigators observed a two-fold higher incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients who had HCV infection compared with those who did not (4) ...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy (RT) is our {{preferred}} modality {{for local}} palliation of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS). A short and intense course of RT is usually needed for rapid palliation and local control of metastatic disease. Seventeen patients at a {{median age of}} 61 had symptomatic metastatic sarcoma and required rapid palliation. The symptoms related to the metastases were either pain or discomfort. All patients were treated by a short and intensive course of administration: 39 Gy were given in 13 fractions of 3 Gy/day, 5 times a week. Median follow-up period was 25 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated. Acute side effects included grade one skin toxicity. No wound complications were noted <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> surgery. Late side effects included skin pigmentation and induration of irradiated soft tissues. Durable pain control was achieved in 12 out 15 cases treated for gross metastases. Tumor progression {{was seen in the}} 3 other cases within a period of two to nine months. Among 5 lesions which were irradiated as an adjunctive treatment following resection, no local recurrence was observed. The results of this series, although limited in size, point to the safety and feasibility of hypofractionated RT for palliation of musculoskeletal metastases from sarcom...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: Our study {{aimed to}} examine the {{management}} of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in Europe and the Mediterranean basin, and to compare adherence to guidelines with that reported in the first Euro Heart Survey on ACS (EHS-ACS-I), 4 years earlier. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective survey conducted in 2004 (EHS-ACS-II), data describing the characteristics, treatment, and outcome of 6385 patients diagnosed with ACS in 190 medical centres in 32 countries were collected. ACS with ST-elevation was the initial diagnosis in 47 % of patients, no ST-elevation in 48 %, and undetermined electrocardiographic pattern in 5 % of patients. Comparison of data collected in 2000 and 2004 showed similar baseline characteristics, but greater use of recommended medications and coronary interventions in EHS-ACS-II. Among patients with ST-elevation, the use of primary reperfusion increased slightly (from 56 to 64 %), with a significant shift from fibrinolytic therapy to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). The use of PPCI rose from 37 to 59 % <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> primary reperfusion therapy. Analysis of data in 34 centres that participated in both surveys showed even greater improvement {{with respect to the}} use of recommended medical therapy, interventions, and outcome. CONCLUSION: Data from EHS-ACS-II suggest an increase in adherence to guidelines for treatment of ACS in comparison with EHS-ACS-I. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} kidney disease (CKD), who usually display low serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 D) and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D (1, 25 D), {{are at high risk}} of infection, notably <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> peritoneal <b>dialysis</b> (PD). We {{hypothesized}} that peritoneal macrophages from PD patients are an important target for vitamin D-induced antibacterial activity. Dialysate effluent fluid was obtained from 27 non-infected PD patients. Flow cytometry indicated that PD cells were mainly monocytic (37. 9 ¡ 17. 7 % cells CD 14 +/CD 45 +). Ex vivo analyses showed that PD cells treated with 25 D (100 nM, 6 hrs) or 1, 25 D (5 nM, 6 hrs) induced mRNA for antibacterial cathelicidin (CAMP) but conversely suppressed mRNA for hepcidin (HAMP). PD cells from patients with peritonitis (n 53) showed higher baseline expression of CAMP (18 -fold¡ 9, p, 0. 05) and HAMP (64 -fold¡ 7) relative to cells from non-infected patients. In 12 non-infected PD patients, oral supplementation with a single dose of vitamin D 2 (100, 000 IU) increased serum levels of 25 D from 18 ¡ 8 to 41 ¡ 15 ng/ml (p 50. 002). This had no significant effect on PD cell CD 14 /CD 4...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} how continued cigarette smoking or smoking cessation related to long-term survival and morbidity in patients with established coronary artery disease managed with medical therapy or coronary bypass surgery. Background. Although the association of cigarette smoking with coronary artery disease is well established, the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking behavior in patients with such disease receiving medical or surgical therapy are less well established. Methods. The 780 patients randomized to medical therapy or coronary bypass surgery in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) were subgrouped according to smoking behavior during a mean 11. 2 -year follow-up interval. Comparisons between smokers and nonsmokers were accomplished by univariate and Cox time-dependent multivariate analyses. Results. Survival at 10 years after entry into the study was 82 % among 468 patients who reported no smoking during follow-up (nonsmokers) compared with 77 % among the 312 smokers (p = 0. 025). Survival was 80 % <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who smoked at entry but stopped (quitters) versus 69 % <b>among</b> <b>those</b> who continued smoking (p = 0. 025). For patients who smoked at baseline and were randomised to bypass surgery, survival at 10 years was 84 % among quitters and 68 % among nonquitters (p = 0. 018); the difference in survival between quitters (75 %) and nonquitters (71 %) was less <b>among</b> <b>those</b> randomized to medical therapy (p = NS). <b>Among</b> <b>those</b> who smoked at baseline, continued smoking increased the relative risk of death by 1. 73. After 10 years, smokers, in comparison with nonsmokers, were less likely to be angina free and more likely to be unemployed and had more activity limitation and more hospital admissions (primarily for chest pain, heart attack, cardiac catheterization, peripheral vascular surgery and stroke). Conclusions. Thus, among patients with documented coronary artery disease, continued cigarette smoking may result in decreased survival—especially <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> bypass surgery. Moreover, smokers have more angina, more unemployment, a greater limitation of physical activity and more hospital admissions...|$|R
40|$|Aims Pain {{and anxiety}} are {{commonly}} reported <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>undergoing</b> orthopaedic surgery. Improvement in anxiety and pain control might {{be achieved by}} supplementing standard care with psychological interventions. However, the effectiveness of adjunctive psychosocial interventions in anxiety and pain control have not been addressed sufficiently by previous systematic reviews in orthopaedic surgeries. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of adjunctive psychosocial techniques to improve perioperative clinical care in orthopaedic surgery, to identify the most effective intervention types and to evaluate potential moderators. Methods We will perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to address the study aims. PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses will be searched between 1980 and 2015. Prospective controlled clinical trials completed in adults, contrasting standard care and standard care supplemented with psychosocial methods, {{will be eligible for}} inclusion. Effectiveness will be assessed through the outcomes of postoperative pain intensity, analgesic requirement, perioperative anxiety, quality of life and postoperative recovery. The results of a random-effect meta-analysis will be reported. To aid implementation of best practice, moderating effects of the type and timing of psychosocial intervention, type of surgical intervention and type of anaesthesia will be evaluated through meta-regression. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup contrasts will follow as necessary. Discussion Recommendations will be made to improve medical care in orthopaedic procedures. The quality of evidence will be rated using GRADE criteria...|$|R
