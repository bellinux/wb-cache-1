Initially, Cafferty was only hired to write a few songs for the film, but he did such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> capturing the feeling of the 1960s and 1980s that Davidson asked him to score the entire film.|$|E

25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally do <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{had other}} issues with Alienation. GameSpot Jason D'Aprile was annoyed by his {{inability}} to pause the game even in single-player mode. Although Metro David Jenkins found its creatures' design [...] "uninspired", the game's overall graphics were decent. According to gamesTM reviewers, Housemarque did not do <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> combining two gameplay elements—the incremental loot system (accomplished through grinding) and the gameplay mechanic in which players repeat stages to increase scores—resulting in a [...] "gameplay cycle that doesn’t match the purity or compulsion of either".|$|E

[...] Miller {{explained}} that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film because, as a fan of the character, he had never felt that Cudmore's version was accurate to the comics and wanted to show the character as [...] "this monstrous guy". Andre Tricoteux had been cast in the role, providing motion reference on set and the voice. In December, the voice of Colossus was revealed to have been recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer did <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell.

500|$|Reviewing {{the novel}} for The Guardian, Mark Lawson wrote that Faulks had made <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> imitating Fleming, as the plot [...] "persistently picks up whispers from the books Fleming left behind", {{and using a}} style and turn of phrase that [...] "read {{as if they were}} {{directly}} borrowed from Fleming." [...] The main difference Lawson identified between Fleming and Faulks was that Faulks [...] "misses the chilling indifference of tone which Bond's creator brought to both kissing and killing". Overall, Lawson considered that Devil May Care [...] "is a smart and enjoyable act of literary resurrection. Among the now 33 post-Fleming Bonds, this must surely compete only with Kingsley Amis's for the title of the best." [...] Nicola Barr, writing for The Guardians Saturday edition, was broadly supportive of Faulks, commenting that [...] "No one expects or wants subtlety from Bond, and Faulks delivers a thriller that manages to feel reassuringly familiar rather than predictable." ...|$|E
