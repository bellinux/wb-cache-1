5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed <b>at</b> <b>being</b> left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete <b>at</b> <b>being</b> exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E

5|$|In November 1897, Frank Chapman {{sponsored}} Beebe {{to become}} an associate member of the American Ornithologists' Union, and the following month Beebe gave his first professional lecture on ornithology to a society called Uncle Clarence's Bergen Point Culture Club. In 1899, although he had completed all of the required courses for a degree in science from Columbia except for mathematics, he decided to forgo his studies {{in favor of an}} invitation from Osborn to work at the New York Zoological Park which was about to open. Several factors contributed to this decision, including both excitement <b>at</b> <b>being</b> part of the zoo, and the sense that his studies were putting too much of a strain on his family's finances.|$|E
5|$|In the Crimea, Heber {{encountered}} the region's large Muslim community, and observed eastern manners and practices {{for the first}} time. He expressed particular pleasure <b>at</b> <b>being</b> greeted with the oriental salaam. The {{course of the war}} in Europe had meanwhile shifted, so that Heber and Thornton were able, on the final stages of their journey, to pass through Poland, Hungary, Austria and Germany to reach the port of Hamburg. On the way they visited Austerlitz, where they heard accounts of the recent battle from the local population. In the course of his enquiries, which included making sketches of the scene, Heber was briefly mistaken for a French spy by local farmers. At Hamburg the two travellers boarded Lord Morpeth's private yacht and sailed for England, arriving at Great Yarmouth on 14 October 1806.|$|E
