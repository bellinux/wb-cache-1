40|$|Many {{emerging}} and reemerging human pathogens {{are derived}} from animals or from <b>animal</b> <b>tissues,</b> <b>waste,</b> or products. A wide range of species including insects (eg, mosquitos), wild animals (eg, rodents, bats, and monkeys), draft animals (eg, horses and mules), and livestock animals (eg, swine, poultry, and cattle) have been implicated in transmission of various highly pathogenic infections, including parasitic, bacterial, and viral diseases, to humans. Among the most deadly emerging zoonotic diseases are viral hemorrhagic fevers, including those caused by the filoviruses, EBOV and MARV. The zoonotic potential of these viruses was identified {{at the time of}} their discovery during the first recognized filovirus outbreak that simultaneously occurred in Germany and Yugoslavia. During this 1967 outbreak, laboratory workers became infected following contact with blood and organs from MARV-infected African green monkeys that had been imported from Uganda. The focus of this review is the zoonotic nature of the filoviruses...|$|R
40|$|My thesis exhibition, “O World, I cannot hold thee close enough,“ at the University of California, San Diego, is the {{culmination}} of artistic work that explores material-based process that abstract the body. My work refers {{to the idea of a}} body less contained by examining the structures that define and protect bodies, using materials to represent a continuous line that binds myself to the Other. By the Other I mean the world outside of myself as an individual. Exploring connectedness through material illustrates Chris Tilley’s idea that, people make things, and things make people. The process of connecting materially is a way to understand the present moment. I use dead hair, <b>animal</b> <b>tissue,</b> paper <b>waste,</b> salt, burlap and iconic myths to describe the continuity that binds past and present. I want to create a language without words, the stories and movements that are transmitted through the body over time. Generations of humans reenact a corporeal and visceral connectedness to one another, and in my work, I seek to give these stories form. 		In this paper I will describe my relationship to my materials and the tools with which I create my work. I will discuss artists whose way of working describes my own, and various mythologies that contribute to my thinking about art practice. Specifically, I will give insight into the ways that storytelling and materials weave together in my projects, including “Compression” and “Hold My Bones” works...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of actinides in <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> samples {{is very important}} for environmental monitoring. There is a need to measure actinide isotopes with very low detection limits in <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> samples, including fish, deer, hogs, beef and shellfish. A new, rapid actinide separation method has been developed and implemented that allows the measurement of plutonium, neptunium, uranium, americium, curium and strontium isotopes in large <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> samples (100 - 200 g) with high chemical recoveries and effective removal of matrix interferences. This method uses stacked TEVA Resin{reg_sign}, TRU Resin{reg_sign} and DGA-Resin{reg_sign} cartridges from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA) that allows the rapid separation of plutonium (Pu), neptunium (Np), uranium (U), americium (Am), and curium (Cm) using a single multi-stage column combined with alpha spectrometry. Sr- 90 is collected on Sr Resin{reg_sign} from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA). After acid digestion and furnace heating of the <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> samples, the actinides and Sr- 89 / 90 are separated using column extraction chromatography. This method {{has been shown to be}} effective over a wide range of <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> matrices.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{resource}} partitioning versus depth for corals collected in February, 1983, from Jamaica was investigated by analyzing their stable nitrogen isotope composition. Observations {{were made on}} isolated zooxanthellae and corresponding algae-free <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> from nine species of symbiotic corals at four depths over a 50 -m bathymetric range, and from a nonsymbiotic coral at 1 m. 5 15 N values versus depth ranged from + 3. 54 to - 2. 15 % 0 for zooxanthellae and from + 4. 71 to + 0. 23 % 0 for <b>animal</b> <b>tissue.</b> In those species that occurred over a 30 - to 50 -m depth range, both <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> and zooxanthellae tended to be depleted in 15 N as depth increased to 30 m. In a few species <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> was enriched in 15 N from 30 to 50 m. Depletion of 15 N in zooxanthellae with increasing depth {{may be the result}} of depth-dependent differences in their nitrogen-specific growth rates. <b>Animal</b> <b>tissue</b> was consistently more depleted in 15 N than for the nonsymbiotic coral Tubastrea coccinea (Ellis) at the same depth, but it was still slightly more enriched in 15 N than corresponding zooxanthellae in 16 of 25 paired samples. The latter trend was not correlated with depth. A comparison of 5 13 C and 5 15 N for zooxanthellae and <b>animal</b> <b>tissue</b> over 50 m revealed a tendency toward depletion of heavy isotopes as depth increases. Increased carbon fixation appears to be accompanied by decreased nitrogen fractionation...|$|R

40|$|Cachexia is {{a common}} {{co-morbidity}} in cancer occurring in up to 80 % of patients {{depending on the type}} of cancer. Uric acid (UA), the end-product of the purine metabolism, is elevated in cachexia due to <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and up-regulated xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. High serum UA levels indicate increased XO dependent production of oxygen free radicals (ROS) and correlate with metabolic illness and poor survival. We hypothesized that XO- inhibition might reduce inflammatory signals accounting for <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and improve survival in experimental cancer cachexia. Animals were inoculated intra-peritoneally with AH- 130 hepatoma cells and treated with two XO-inhibitors: allopurinol (Allo, low and high dose 4 and 40 mg/kg/d) and its more effective active metabolite oxypurinol (Oxy, 4 and 40 mg/kg/d), or placebo for 15 days. Weight loss and <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> of both fat and lean tissue (assessed by NMR-scanning) was reduced by both low (LD) and high dose (HD) Allo and low dose LD-Oxy, but not by HD-Oxy. A robust induction of XO-activity for generation of reactive oxygen species was seen in the placebo-group (assessed by electron paramagnetic spectroscopy), which was reduced by XO-inhibition. Increased ROS induced cytokine signaling, proteolytic activity and tissue degradation were all attenuated by XO inhibition. Survival was significantly and dose dependently improved. Food-intake and spontaneous locomotor activity were higher, indicating a higher quality of life. Inhibition of XO can reduce <b>tissue</b> <b>wasting</b> and improve survival in cancer cachexia and clearly clinical studies are needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tissue</b> <b>waste</b> is {{a problem}} for the tissue paper {{industry}} because the drying process and transporting of this waste are expensive. As a result this waste landed in land fill. Addition of starch in <b>tissue</b> <b>waste</b> suggests a good way to overcome the problem. Three different types of starch were used, corn starch, rice starch, and tapioca starch. However, starch blended with <b>tissue</b> <b>waste</b> produces products with weaknesses in strength, water resistance and cannot be thermoformed. HDPE as binder was added to improve these properties and processability. Melt flow index (MFI) is used to determine the processability and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine thermal behavior of the most suitable starch to the purpose of thermoforming process. Compounding was done on two-roll mill to form sheet prior to the thermoforming process. Results showed corn starch was most suitable starch base on tensile and water absorption test. Apart of that, by using DSC, corn starch demonstrated better compatibility between components in blends as it showed one melting point. Unfortunately, this formulation has low values of MFI due to high viscosity.
