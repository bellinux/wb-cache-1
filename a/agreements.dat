5|$|In February 1944, Meyszner's {{campaign}} against the German-Chetnik <b>agreements</b> escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the <b>agreements</b> tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, {{on the grounds that}} they had not upheld their previous <b>agreements</b> and that the Croats, as well as Muslims in Albania, Kosovo and the Sandžak, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks.

40|$|Abstract] The aim of {{this study}} is to examine how {{participants}} express their <b>agreement</b> during a conversation for planning a trip through comparing Japanese and Korean internal situations. Also, this paper describes how <b>agreement</b> consists of, and what kinds of strategies participants used to express their <b>agreement.</b> In order to explore the above, I analyzed 6 Japanese internal situations and 7 Korean internal situations. As a result, I found <b>agreement</b> consists of prior utterance, <b>agreement</b> utterance, and reaction. I classify <b>agreement</b> as substantial <b>agreement</b> and ritual <b>agreement.</b> For the strategies, I classify them as direct-verbal <b>agreement,</b> indirect-verbal <b>agreement,</b> and non-verbal <b>agreement.</b> Compared to both situations, there were an average of 10 more utterances in the Japanese internal situation. Moreover, nods and style-shifts as contextualization cues asking for <b>agreement</b> were only present in the Japanese internal situation...|$|R
5|$|Due to the FCC's {{limits on}} station {{ownership}} {{at the time}} (which prevented the common ownership of multiple radio stations), local marketing <b>agreements</b> in radio, in which a smaller station would sell its entire airtime to a third-party in time-buy, were widespread between the 1970s and early 1990s. These alliances gave larger broadcasters a way to expand their reach, and smaller broadcasters a means of obtaining a stable stream of revenue. In 1992, the FCC began allowing broadcasting companies to own multiple radio stations in a single market. Following these changes, local marketing <b>agreements</b> largely fell out of favor for radio, as it was now possible for broadcasters to simply buy another station outright rather than lease it – consequentially triggering a wave of mass consolidation in the radio industry. However, broadcasters still used local marketing <b>agreements</b> to help transition acquired stations to their new owners.|$|E

30|$|When the {{homogeneous}} <b>agreement</b> model still cannot adequately {{capture the}} <b>agreement</b> {{information in the}} data, the homogeneous <b>agreement</b> term is replaced by three terms representing different <b>agreement</b> strengths in each reading category. This is called the non-homogeneous <b>agreement</b> model. Note that if all the categories have a uniform level of <b>agreement,</b> {{we will have the}} homogeneous <b>agreement</b> model. The modeling procedure is described in detail in the appendix.|$|R
30|$|Sensitivity, specificity, {{positive}} and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), and {{positive and}} negative likelihood ratios (LR) for both the UWF and Zeiss imaging techniques in detecting VH were calculated. An <b>agreement</b> between the two imaging techniques, inter-observer <b>agreement,</b> and intra-observer <b>agreement</b> in detecting VH were calculated using the weighted kappa statistic to account for any random chance in <b>agreement.</b> An adjusted inter-observer <b>agreement</b> was also determined by awarding <b>agreement</b> between the two graders for all images that had a clinical grade of 0 or 0.5 + VH. A 95  % confidence interval was calculated for each kappa value. The kappa measure lies {{on a scale from}} − 1 to 1, where negative values represent <b>agreement</b> less than chance, 0 represents <b>agreement</b> no more than chance, and 1 represents perfect <b>agreement</b> [19]. A commonly used scale designates a k value of 0.01 – 0.20 as slight <b>agreement,</b> 0.21 – 0.40 as fair <b>agreement,</b> 0.41 – 0.60 as moderate <b>agreement,</b> 0.61 – 0.80 as substantial <b>agreement,</b> and 0.81 – 0.99 as almost perfect <b>agreement</b> [20].|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{the overall}} inter-observer <b>agreement</b> {{of the main}} AO types and their groups was {{moderate}} with good intra-observer <b>agreement.</b> Among the consultant trauma surgeons, the inter-observer <b>agreement</b> was fair with moderate intra-observer <b>agreement</b> for the main types and good intra-observer <b>agreement</b> for the groups. For C-type fractures in particular, the overall inter-observer <b>agreement</b> was fair with moderate intra-observer <b>agreement.</b> These {{results show that the}} AO classification for distal radius fractures requiring operative treatment does not have an adequate reproducibility. Classification of distal radius fractures with both pre- and post-reduction radiographs might lead to a higher inter-observer <b>agreement</b> although the <b>agreement</b> is still not sufficient. A simplified classification system may improve <b>agreement</b> among clinicians.|$|R
5|$|In 2014 under {{chairman}} Tom Wheeler, the FCC {{began to}} increase its scrutiny {{regarding the use of}} such agreements—particularly joint sales—to evade its policies. On March 31, 2014, the commission voted to make joint sales <b>agreements</b> count as ownership if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time for its partner, and to ban coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the top four stations in a market. Wheeler indicated that he planned to address local marketing and shared services <b>agreements</b> in the future. The change in stance also prompted changes to then-proposed acquisitions by Gray Television and Sinclair Broadcast Group, who, rather than use sharing <b>agreements</b> to control them, moved their existing programming and network affiliations to digital subchannels of existing company-owned stations in the market, and then relinquished control over them by selling the stations to minority-owned broadcasters intending to operate them independently.|$|E

5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales <b>agreements</b> and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations within a given market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other <b>agreements,</b> such as shared services <b>agreements.</b> The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales <b>agreements</b> involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing <b>agreements</b> under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales <b>agreements</b> in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales <b>agreements</b> on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
