In late March, several major Chinese ticketing agencies—eLong, LY.com, Qunar and Mango—discontinued the sale of <b>airline</b> <b>tickets</b> to Malaysia and several large Chinese travel agencies reported a 50-percent drop in tourists compared to the same period the year before. China was the third largest source of visitors to Malaysia prior to Flight 370's disappearance, accounting for 1.79million tourists in 2013.

25|$|When a {{real-world}} airline is {{created in the}} image of a virtual airline, legal issues can arise out of copyright violations. In 2003, a real world airline, Qantas Airways Ltd, announced a new low-cost carrier by the name of Jetstar Airways. However, a virtual airline named Jetstar International Airlines already existed, complete with a web site. As part of their startup promotion, Qantas sold 100,000 <b>airline</b> <b>tickets</b> at a discount price, and the virtual airline's web site was swamped with would-be customers, job-seekers, and prospective vendors. The virtual airline sued Qantas, claiming that Qantas stole the virtual airline's livery and trademark. The matter was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} put new {{requirements on}} the employers, demanding that they deposit a sum of 1,500,000 LBP (1000 $) {{in the housing}} bank as a prerequisite to get authorization of employment.

The problem with these requirements is that the money is not used to fulfill its purpose of covering <b>airline</b> <b>tickets</b> when it is needed. The Lebanese government has as well been ineffective with implementing the migration workers ban from entering into Lebanon from the country of Nepal, the Lebanese government simply kept issuing pre-approved work permits and visas.|$|E
