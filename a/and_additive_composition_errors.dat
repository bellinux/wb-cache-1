We adopt {{the occurrence of}} links in the computed paths as a cost function used to achieve load balancing by reducing the interference among competing flows. We adapt the the Non-Sorting Genetic Algorithm(NSGA) to find a Pareto front for the multi-objective problem. This Pareto front expresses a set of solutions which represent plausible set of paths that minimize both the interference among competing flows and the queuing delay in the network.

40|$|A paraffin/water-dispersion is a {{pumpable}} {{latent heat}} storage medium. Latent heat storage mediums store energy by using the heat of crystallization during the phase transition from liquid to solid. Because of that mechanism these materials are also called phase change materials (PCM). To make solid PCMs pumpable they are dispersed in water. The aim of this work is to define the flow characteristics of paraffin/water-dispersions and {{to figure out the}} relationship between the sort of paraffin, paraffin concentration <b>and</b> <b>additive</b> <b>compositions.</b> The measurements for that analysis are done with a rheometer. The measurement results reveal that paraffin/water-dispersions show shear thinning behavior with a strong viscosity drop in a span of low shear rates. With an increasing paraffin <b>and</b> <b>additive</b> concentration the viscosity raises. For describing the flow properties, the mathematical relationship of the Ostwald- de Waele power law is used.

This material can attain high densities during liquid phase sintering if suitable additives are used. Silicon carbides containing silica, alumina and rare earth oxides have suitable characteristics to promote liquid phase sintering. In this paper, the sintering behavior of silicon carbide ceramics with additives based on the (SiO 2 -RE 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3) system (RE = Y, Dy) has been studied. Samples with different compositions and containing 90 vol. % SiC were sintered in a dilatometer at 1950 °C/ 1 h and in a graphite resistance furnace from 1500 °C/ 1 h up to 1950 °C/ 1 h.

40|$|The {{research}} of inter- and intra-individual differences in arithmetical development has revealed notable discrepancies and dissociations {{between the three}} main forms of arithmetical knowledge, namely procedural, factual and conceptual knowledge, and has supported the view that arithmetical ability is not unitary but involves the quite often variable development of different components (e. g. Dowker, 1998; Cowan, 2003). The present pilot study explored the conceptual, procedural and factual knowledge that 6 - 7 year old children of different abilities in arithmetic employ when solving conceptually linked numerical addition problems. Conceptually linked addition problems have been previously used in research on children’s understanding of addition principles (e. g. Dowker 1998; Canobi, 2005). The focus {{of this study was}} particularly on studying and comparing different children’s ability to use and combine all three aforementioned types of knowledge in their problem solving approaches either spontaneously or after explicit prompt. Thirty three children of different abilities in arithmetic, as assessed by their teachers, took part in individual problem solving sessions, each lasting 30 minutes. The children were presented with pairs of addition problems which involved either two or three terms and which were related by the principles of commutativity, associativity <b>and</b> <b>additive</b> <b>composition.</b> Children’s approaches to the first of each pair of problems were indicators of their ability to use calculation procedures or factual knowledge to work out the answers. Children’s approaches to the second problem were indicators of their attempt and/or ability to use their conceptual knowledge in order to derive the answer from the first problem solution (erroneous or not) either spontaneously or after an explicit prompt. The paper discusses the similarities and differences observed in the problem solving approaches of two particular cases: an able child and a child who is underachieving in arithmetic. The analysis of these two cases shows notable differences in the mastery and use of procedural knowledge but similar levels of factual and conceptual knowledge accompanied by noteworthy differences in the spontaneous use of these latter two types of knowledge in problem solving...|$|R

40|$|Deaf {{children}} {{lag behind}} their hearing peers in mathematical attainment. The {{reasons for this}} delay remain unclear. Two methods were used to identify the causes for this underachievement: a longitudinal investigation of predictors of mathematical attainment, and comparison with hearing children. In order for a cause of delay to be identified, both investigative strategies must produce positive results. The deaf children must lag behind the hearing children on the measures and the same measures must predict deaf children's mathematics attainment. The comparative study: The participants were: a) 42 hearing impaired (HI) children age range from 7; 2 years to 9; 1 years attending units and special schools located on eight different sites around London; b) 73 hearing children aged from 7; 2 years to 8; 11 years, classmates of some HI children attending a unit based in a mainstream school. A standardised maths test, a measure of their understanding of <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> (the Shop Task), a memory scan task and tasks assessing understanding of time concepts were administered to all the children. The last two assessments were developed for the study. The performance by the HI children on standardised assessments was also compared to norms standardised on hearing populations. The deaf obtained significantly lower scores on {{nearly all of the}} tasks. In the maths test the mean standardised score for the hearing children was 92. 68 and for the deaf children was 78. 31. There were also significant differences on the memory scan task — the accuracy rates were lower, memory capacity sizes were smaller and the number processing speed was slower for the deaf children. On the time concept tasks the hearing children obtained significantly more correct responses on the tasks assessing change, ability to infer and order events. When the HI children's performance was compared to the norms of standardised assessments, a similar picture emerged. The mean Number Age was 1; 1 year behind the hearing norms. The mean WISC score obtained was one standard deviation below the published mean. Raw scores obtained on the reading comprehension task were too low to be standardised. In assessments of receptive language, the HI children obtained standardised scores that were 1 standard deviation below the mean. It was concluded that all of these variables could be examined as predictor variables in the longitudinal study. The longitudinal study: The HI children participating in the comparison study were assessed twice again over the academic year. The outcome measures were scores on standardised mathematics assessments. The predictors were demographic and medical background; intelligence, language; understanding of time; memory capacity and number processing speed; numerical skills such as counting <b>and</b> <b>additive</b> <b>composition.</b> The only demographic variable consistently associated with mathematics scores was age. Analyses using fixed order multiple regression explored the relationships between the various cognitive, numerical and linguistic predictors and mathematics attainment.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we will {{investigate}} {{some of the}} properties of the circle composition (or adjoint) operation in rings, where the operation o is defined by aob = a + b + ab. In arbitrary rings, R, the properties of addition and multiplication imply that (R, o) is a semigroup; in certain classes of rings this semigroup has additional properties and we shall examine a few of these. Our main concern will be commutative quasiregular (Jacobson radical) rings. In such rings (R, o) is an abelian group, giving R a second such structure besides (R,+). It seems a natural question to ask if these group structures can ever be isomorphic. The zero rings, in which multiplication is trivial, obviously have this property since the <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> circle <b>composition</b> groups coincide; thus the class, K, of rings having isomorphic <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> circle <b>composition</b> groups is non-empty. There are also non-trivial examples and we illustrate the construction of some, including the so-called quasifields which are constructed on partially ordered sets, and examples which use finite groups for addition. It might be suspected that for these less trivial examples the isomorphism between addition and circle composition will still force multiplication to behave in a nearly trivial way, so that perhaps such rings are nil or nilpotent. This need not be the case as there is a ring in K which has no zero divisors. In fact, we show that there exist rings in K which are nilpotent but not zero rings, nil but not nilpotent, and quasiregular without being nil. We will also consider the algebraic properties of the class K, including the question of its inheritance under ring theoretic constructions. In particular, we show that K is not a radical class, that it is closed under direct products, but that it is not hereditary and that it is not closed under homomorphisms nor taking quasiregular subrings. There are, however, certain subclasses of K which are better behaved, including, for example, rings which are algebras over Zp or Q and the rings constructed on certain finite groups. For commutative nilpotent rings we prove the existence of a polynomial homomorphism between the <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> circle <b>composition</b> groups, which in certain circumstances will be an isomorphism. We show, too, that all finitely generated nilpotent Q-algebras and Z-algebras are in K. The former result allows us to demonstrate that all commutative nil Q-algebras are in K. We conclude by considering a family of ring examples in which the circle composition semigroup is regular. Our construction is developed from the idea behind the quasifield construction and also generalised power series rings. We investigate the existence of nilpotence in such rings, and show that, like K, the class of rings in which (R,o) is a regular semigroup is not a radical class. This result also holds for the stronger property that (R,o) is a union of groups...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study investigates {{relationships}} between concrete containing pozzolanic <b>additive</b> <b>and</b> mineralogical <b>composition,</b> porosity and chemical durability to sulphate ion containing solution. As pozzolanic admixtures micro and nano size silica and biomass ashes were used. The investigation {{was carried out}} by X-ray diffraction, Hg absorption porosimetry and optical microscopy. The pozzolanic additives activate the process of mineralization and are acting both as the cementitious admixture as well as the fine filler. The crystalline phases in all depths of the specimen, mass change, porosity were investigated after the exposure of concrete in sulphate ions containing solution for 1 - 6 months under static conditions. The way of sulphate attack depends on a pozzolanic <b>additives</b> <b>and</b> kind of sulphate solution. X-ray phase analysis of concrete in different depth after exposure in solution identified gypsum for concrete with additives only up to 10 mm. The addition of fine dispersed additives decreases the number of pores in all range, especially in 1 … 103 μm. Cementitious properties of pozzolanic materials and crystallization of sulphate salt in pores decrease number of pores in range 0. 5 … 10 − 3 μm. Studies have shown that the pozzolanic additives reduce porosity, increase density and as a consequence increase the chemical durability of concrete to sulphate ion containing solution...|$|R
40|$|Comprehensive {{knowledge}} {{about the influence of}} the <b>additive</b> <b>composition</b> on the degradation behavior of the most important photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant, ethylene vinyl actetate (EVA), is crucial for enhancing its durability. To analyze this influence, EVA foils with different <b>additive</b> <b>compositions</b> were exposed to UV irradiation (135 W/m 2) at 60 °C with a UV-A lamp, and characterized by spectroscopic methods (UV-vis, Raman spectroscopy) and DSC measurements. The reference foil with minimal additives showed significant changes in consistency during UV exposure. Those changes were explained by chain scissions, changes in conformation and crystallinity. In particular, degradation induced changes in the intensity of the symmetric compared to the asymmetric CH 2 stretching vibrations, detected by Raman spectroscopy, indicate modifications in the conformational and crystalline setup. Therefore, their intensity ratio offers a nondestructive method to follow EVA degradation in PV modules. A major influence of additives on the development of fluorescent and chromophoric species was found. A quenching effect of oxygen on the development of fluorescent species was observed...|$|R
