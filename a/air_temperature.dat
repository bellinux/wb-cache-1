Later in the day, when the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> may reach over 50°C, the birds are inactive and {{have the ability to}} increase their thermal insulation when the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> exceeds their body temperatures. At very high temperatures they also resort to gular fluttering and gaping to cool themselves. At night, several flocks coalesce and fly off into the rocky desert far away from any vegetation. Each bird scrapes itself a shallow sleeping hollow by moving from side to side. There are no jerboas or other small mammals in these barren wastes so foxes and jackals do not roam there at night and the birds are safe.|$|E

5|$|Dew {{point is}} the {{temperature}} to which a given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called dew. The dew point is a saturation point. When the dew point temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The dew point is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the dew point is closer to the current <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> If the relative humidity is 100%, the dew point is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant dew point, an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity. At a given barometric pressure, independent of temperature, the dew point determines the specific humidity of the air. The dew point is an important statistic for general aviation pilots, as it is used to calculate the likelihood of carburetor icing and fog. When used with the <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> a formula can be used to estimate the height of cumuliform, or convective, clouds.|$|E

The variation of <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones.

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze when the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind {{as much as}} several kilometers.|$|E
40|$|The {{bioclimatic}} temperatures {{that mountain}} plants experience {{are very different}} from the macroclimatic temperatures and vary according to the exposition, relief, and growth form.

Microsite temperatures were compared to the <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> provided by meteorological stations of the official weather service nearby. In winter plant temperatures below the snow are largely uncoupled from the free <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> During the growing season, across all zones, plant temperatures diverge to differing degrees from free <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> depending on the growth form of plants and the canopy structure. In Vaccinietum communities and in closed grassland, average temperature differences between the free air and plant canopy were 0. 5 K in July and August. Prostrate mats of the Loiseleuria heath, rosette and cushion plants, however, heat up much more than erect plants during sunny periods, and mean plant temperatures were about 2 – 3 Kwarmer than the free <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> As a result, the adiabatic lapserate for bioclimatic temperatures of the life zones in the Alps does not parallel the adiabatic lapse rate of free <b>air</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular <b>air</b> <b>temperature.</b> How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} vortex ring state.

The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side.

None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall.

40|$|Climate change poses {{significant}} {{threats to}} biodiversity, but some species {{may be able}} to escape its effects in small locations with unusual and stable climates (microrefugia). However, there are still great uncertainties about where microrefugia are located, and the exact role that moisture plays in buffering extreme temperatures. In this study we quantified the effects of moisture on the distribution and variability of near-surface soil and <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> We collected hourly 1 cm soil and 5 cm <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> and humidities at 111 sites from May 2011 to March 2012. Sites were diverse in terms of elevation (2 - 1428 m), distance from coast (180 m- 403 km), canopy cover (0 - 100 %), topographic exposure, and susceptibility to cold air drainage. We found that variability (diurnal range) of both soil and <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> decreased under moister conditions. While <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> were related more strongly to humidity, soil temperatures were related more to vapour pressure deficit (VPD). That is, both high temperature and low humidity were required before the VPD was sufficient to dry out the soil and allow soil temperatures to vary. We then used a regional regression approach to model the spatial distribution of minimum and maximum <b>air</b> and soil <b>temperatures</b> for each day over the 10 months in terms of latitude, elevation, canopy cover, distance to coast, cold air drainage potential, and topographic exposure to the south and northwest. We found that elevation was the dominant factor explaining the distribution of soil and <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> under moist conditions. Other factors, such as canopy cover and topographic exposure, had a stronger influence on <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> whenever humidity was low. However, these factors only affected soil temperatures at times when higher temperatures combined with low humidity to produce higher VPD. Our results provide new insights into how moisture influences the spatial distribution of near-surface soil and <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Microrefugia will be more apparent under drier conditions, but climate change may affect refugia for soil and <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> differently. Higher temperatures will cause VPD to increase more than would be expected by any change in humidity, and refugia in terms of soil temperatures may therefore become increasingly apparent...|$|R
