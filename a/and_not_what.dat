500|$|In {{order to}} ensure his story would be chosen to air, Gordon decided to play up the {{elements}} of anti-Semitism. Originally, however, the script called for both the protagonists and the antagonists to be African Americans, and the main protagonist to be a [...] "Louis Farrakhan-like" [...] character. Gordon later rewrote the script because he realized [...] "black anti-Semitism is a very subtle and difficult subject <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> I needed in my dramatic structure." [...] To {{create the kind of}} hate propaganda that Brunjes and his printshop made in the episode, Gordon contacted the Anti-Defamation League and requested samples.

500|$|Though often styled a battle, {{in reality}} the {{engagement}} at Lexington was a minor brush or skirmish. As the regulars' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19, 1775, about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them, and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from {{along the side of}} the road. [...] Their leader was Captain John Parker, a veteran of the French and Indian War, who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear. [...] Of the militiamen who lined up, nine had the surname Harrington, seven Munroe (including the company's orderly sergeant, William Munroe), four Parker, three Tidd, three Locke, and three Reed; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way. [...] This group of militiamen was part of Lexington's [...] "training band", a way of organizing local militias dating back to the Puritans, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> was styled a minuteman company.|$|E
500|$|A new utility called MacroMaker was {{included}} with System 6. When enabled, it allowed users to record mouse and keyboard input as [...] "macros." [...] MacroMaker had a unique user interface, which aimed {{to look and}} act like a tape recorder. MacroMaker was criticized for its lack of features when compared to Microsoft's AutoMac III, which was already available commercially. As MacroMaker only recorded the locations of mouse-clicks inside windows <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> was being clicked or exactly when, users soon found {{that it could not}} be used to automate more sophisticated programs. The pre-recorded clicks would miss buttons if they had moved or failed to appear upon playback. In addition, MacroMaker had limitations wherein it recorded the start and end locations of mouse movements but not the precise path of the movements, and its macros did not handle situations that required the macro to wait {{for a period of time}} before or after an action. MacroMaker was not compatible with System 7, which marked the introduction of AppleScript as an alternative.|$|E

500|$|Fantasia holds a 96% [...] "fresh" [...] rating {{based on}} a sample of 50 reviews, with an average score of 8.6 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes, a website which {{aggregates}} film reviews. Its consensus—"A landmark in animation and a huge influence on the medium of music video, Disney's Fantasia is a relentlessly inventive blend of the classics with phantasmagorical images". TV Guide awarded the film four stars, calling it [...] "the most ambitious animated feature ever {{to come out of}} the Disney studios", noting how the film [...] "integrates famous works of classical music with wildly uneven but extraordinarily imaginative visuals that run the gamut from dancing hippos to the purely abstract". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film four stars out of four, and noted that throughout Fantasia, [...] "Disney pushes the edges of the envelope". However, Empire magazine only rated it 2 stars out of 5 (poor), concluding [...] "this is a very patchy affair - while some of the animated pieces work, others come across as downright insane". Remarks have also been made about Fantasia not being a children's film. Mark I. Pinksy considers Fantasia to be one of the more problematic of Disney's animated features in that it was intended as much as for adults as children <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> people had come to expect.|$|E

[...] " [...] just a world where people love people for who they are <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> they are and that creates such a broad variety of characters.

2500|$|The limited {{schedule}} for Live It Up meant that DeWyze {{had to write}} his songs while on tour, which he found to be an overwhelming task.

He described the situation as [...] "one of those too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen kind of things". Although DeWyze felt that he and RCA were not thinking the same thing regarding his musical style, he still had high hopes about recording a second album with them and trying to take it in a different direction, but in September 2011, he was dismissed by the label. He said that this was disheartening <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> he would have expected, but that the decision was [...] "fairly mutual" [...] and followed a series of talks between him and RCA.|$|E

2500|$|Formal or sober {{clothing}} is typically worn beneath the gown so, for example, men would often wear {{a dark suit}} with {{a white shirt and}} a tie, or clerical clothing, military or civil uniform, or national dress, and women would wear equivalent attire. Some older universities, particularly Oxford and Cambridge, have a prescribed set of dress (known as subfusc) to be worn under the gown. Though some universities are relaxed about what people wear under their gowns, it is nevertheless considered bad form to be in casual wear or the like during graduation ceremonies, and a number of universities may bar finishing students from joining the procession or the ceremony itself if not appropriately dressed (though this sometimes refers only to requiring the proper wear of academic dress <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> is worn beneath it, if unseen).

2500|$|Bethesda re-announced Prey 2 in March 2011 for {{a planned}} 2012 release. Human Head Studios would {{continue}} to be the developer of this game. The announced game had several major changes from what had been described before while it was under development at 3D Realms/Radar Group, including the game in gameplay style as an open world game, and the shift of narrative from Tommy to Killian. Though the team had access to the newer id Tech 5 engine, they had been working since 2009 on a modified id Tech 4 engine that they opted to retain that engine. Project lead Chris Rhinehart said [...] "Prey 2 will provide gamers the opportunity to explore a new facet of the Prey universe, one that offers fast-paced action in an open, alien world. We're excited to show gamers the title we have been working on and hope they will be as excited by this title as we are." [...] According to Pete Hines, the vice president of public relations and marketing at Bethesda, the current version of the game is what the developers wanted to make <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> has been announced before by the Radar Group.|$|E
2500|$|The {{case was}} {{assigned}} to US District Court Judge Gregory Woods. Woods dismissed the case in March 2016, but allowed Nungesser another attempt. Nungesser issued an amended complaint in April 2016. The amended complaint argued that Columbia University's sexual assault policies promoted a stereotype of the [...] "sex-driven male", and constituted gender based discrimination in violation of Title IX. On March 24, 2017 Woods dismissed Nungesser's re-filed complaint, ruling that Nungesser had failed to state an actionable claim against Columbia University. After having the lawsuit dismissed twice, Nungesser had prepared an appeal, but he eventually agreed to settle with the university in July 2017. The terms of the settlement were confidential.After the settlement, {{the administration of the}} university issued a statement saying “Columbia recognizes that after the conclusion of the investigation, Paul’s remaining time at Columbia became very difficult for him <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>what</b> Columbia would want any of its students to experience.

[...] Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, [...] "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time." [...] Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the New Statesman wrote, [...] "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens' illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he is increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like."
