5|$|Many groups <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> {{groups and}} {{examples}} of other mathematical structures. In the language of category theory, they are group objects in a category, meaning that they are objects (that is, examples of another mathematical structure) which come with transformations (called morphisms) that mimic the group axioms. For example, every group (as defined above) is also a set, so a group is a group object {{in the category of}} sets.|$|E
5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E

25|$|In nuclear physics, double {{beta decay}} {{is a type}} of {{radioactive}} decay in which two protons <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> transformed into two neutrons, or vice versa, inside an atomic nucleus.

As a result of this transformation, the nucleus emits two detectable beta particles, which are electrons or positrons.|$|E

25|$|Hypermediated: This form of {{remediation}} {{attempts to}} “refashion the older medium or media entirely, while still marking {{the presence of}} the older media and therefore maintaining a sense of multiplicity or hypermediacy” (p.46).

Hypermediated remediation is akin to “a mosaic in which we <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> aware of the individual pieces and their new, in-appropriate setting” (p.47).|$|E

25|$|The {{intersection}} {{of two or}} more matroids is the family of sets that <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> independent in each of the matroids. The problem of finding the largest set, or the maximum weighted set, in the {{intersection of}} two matroids can be found in polynomial time, and provides a solution to many other important combinatorial optimization problems. For instance, maximum matching in bipartite graphs can be expressed as a problem of intersecting two partition matroids. However, finding the largest set in an intersection of three or more matroids is NP-complete.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Dr. Watson Scott Swail founded EPI to {{establish}} stronger connections between educational research and educational policy, {{with an emphasis}} on historically underserved communities such as students from low-income families, students of color, and students with disabilities. Swail chose this focus because these student populations tend to be the primary target of the majority of educational policy programs, while their voices <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> under-represented in the policy-making arena. This discrepancy points to the need for a greater understanding of what factors have the greatest influence on their educational outcomes.|$|E

Note that the total wave repeats at 100Hz, but there is no actual 100Hz sinusoidal component.|$|E

In addition, the House of Delegates has the sole power to impeach members of the executive branch, including the Governor. Once the House of Delegates has passed articles of impeachment, the person impeached stands trial before the State Senate.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many and varied {{references}} to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of the psychological and subcultural term , his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness, and freedom of speech. In modern culture his works <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica. Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus {{became a symbol of}} the artist's struggle with the censor. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of a {{dendritic}} spike {{through a}} single strong synaptic input {{does not guarantee}} that the spike will propagate reliably over long distances. If multiple synapses <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> activated, dendritic spikes may be formed through spatial summation. Spatial summation involves the addition of multiple input signals resulting in a larger signal and possibly a dendritic spike. Hippocampal CA1 neurons {{have been shown to}} produce reliable dendritic spike propagation through spatial summation of multiple synaptic inputs. In the hippocampus, the CA1 neurons contain two distinctive regions that receive excitatory synaptic inputs: the perforant path (PP) through the apical dendritic tuft (500-750 μm from soma) and the Schaffer-collateral (SC) through the basal and apical dendrites (250-500 μm from soma). Studies show that individual stimulation of either the PP or SC was not sufficient enough to allow a dendritic spike to initiate an action potential. However, it was shown that when a dendritic spike occurred due to PP stimulations, the presence of a SC stimulation determined whether or not the signal would propagate to the soma.|$|E

25|$|Michel Callon's {{concept of}} framing {{provides}} a useful schema: each economic act or transaction occurs against, incorporates and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network relations <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed upon agents as they come to work in markets and are “formatted” as calculative agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that produced actors predisposed to exchange under certain sets of rules. Therefore, for Challon, market transactions can never be disembedded from social and geographic relations {{and there is no}} sense to talking of degrees of embeddedness and disembeddeness. An emerging theme is the interrelationship, inter-penetrability and variations of concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-structuralist theorizing that draws on Michel Foucault and Actor Network Theory and stress relational aspects of person-hood, and dependence and integration into networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.|$|E
25|$|Emma finds Neal, {{after he}} is {{initially}} {{nowhere to be}} found, {{only to find that}} he is trapped within Mr. Gold, thus causing him to lose his mind. Neal asks for Emma to separate him from Mr. Gold to defeat the Wicked Witch, even though he will die; she reluctantly agrees. Belle later learns that Zelena needs three ingredients to create a time travel spell, consisting of Rumplestiltskin's brain, David's courage, and Regina's heart. When Regina summons her mother in order to discover her history with Zelena, Cora possesses Mary Margaret, who is able to witness her own mother Eva's cruel past towards Cora. The group then work out that Zelena wants to travel back and kill Eva for revealing her baby secret to Prince Leopold. Zelena later curses Hook, so that if he kisses Emma, she will lose her powers, which <b>are</b> <b>simultaneously</b> being strengthened by Regina's teaching. Mary Margaret later finds Henry's fairytale book again, understanding that this allowed Emma's memories to be restored originally. Though Emma wants Henry to have a normal life she decides that he must know the truth and gives him the book, restoring his memories. After Regina kisses Henry, the curse is broken and the residents' missing memories are returned. They learn that Zelena has a pendant on her that enables her to focus her magic and only a strong light magic user, like Emma, can stop her.|$|E
