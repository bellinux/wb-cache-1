6000|$|And again, of the axioms of mechanics: “As we admit no such [...] propositions, {{other than}} as truths inductively {{collected}} from [...] observation, even in geometry itself, it {{can hardly be}} expected [...] that, in a science of obviously contingent relations, we should [...] acquiesce in a contrary view. Let us take one of these axioms and [...] examine its evidence: for instance, that equal forces [...] perpendicularly applied at the opposite ends of equal arms of a [...] straight lever will balance each other. What but experience, we may [...] ask, in the first place, can possibly inform us that a force so [...] applied will have any tendency to turn the lever on its centre at [...] all? or that force can be so transmitted along a rigid line [...] perpendicular to its direction, as to act elsewhere in space than [...] along its own line of action? Surely this is so far from being [...] self-evident that it has even a paradoxical appearance, which is [...] only to be removed by giving our lever thickness, material [...] composition, and molecular powers. Again, we conclude, that the two [...] forces, being equal and applied under precisely similar [...] circumstances, must, if they exert any effort at all to turn the [...] lever, exert equal and opposite efforts: but what a priori [...] reasoning can possibly assure us that they do act under precisely [...] similar circumstances? that points which differ in place are [...] similarly circumstanced as regards the exertion of force? that [...] universal space may not have relations to universal force—or, at all [...] events, that {{the organization of the}} material universe may not be [...] such as to place that portion of space occupied by it in such [...] relations to the forces exerted in it, as may invalidate the [...] absolute similarity of circumstances assumed? Or we may argue, what [...] have we to do with the notion of <b>angular</b> <b>movement</b> in the lever at [...] all? The case is one of rest, and of quiescent destruction of force [...] by force. Now how is this destruction effected? Assuredly by the [...] counter-pressure which supports the fulcrum. But would not this [...] destruction equally arise, and by the same amount of counteracting [...] force, if each force simply pressed its own half of the lever [...] against the fulcrum? And what can assure us that it is not so, [...] except removal of one or other force, and consequent tilting of the [...] lever? The other fundamental axiom of statics, that the pressure on [...] the point of support is the sum of the weights ... is merely a [...] scientific transformation and more refined mode of stating a coarse [...] and obvious result of universal experience, viz., that the weight of [...] a rigid body is the same, handle it or suspend it in what position [...] or by what point we will, and that whatever sustains it sustains its [...] total weight. Assuredly, as Mr. Whewell justly remarks, ‘No one [...] probably ever made a trial for the purpose of showing that the [...] pressure on the support is equal to the sum of the weights.’ ... But [...] it is precisely because in every action of his life from earliest [...] infancy he has been continually making the trial, and seeing it made [...] by every other living being about him, that he never dreams of [...] staking its result on one additional attempt made with scientific [...] accuracy. This would be as if a man should resolve to decide by [...] experiment whether his eyes were useful for the purpose of seeing, [...] by hermetically sealing himself up for half an hour in a metal [...] case.” ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Angular</b> <b>movements</b> of {{the rear}} {{standard}} change the angle between the lens plane and the film plane just as front standard <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> do. Though rear standard tilt changes the plane of sharp focus {{in the same manner}} as front standard tilt, this is not usually the reason to use rear tilt/swing. When a lens is a certain distance (its focal length) away from the film, distant objects, such as faraway mountains, are in focus. Moving the lens farther from the film brings closer objects into focus. Tilting or swinging the film plane puts one side of the film farther from the lens than the center is and the opposite point of the film is therefore closer to the lens.|$|R

Computer navigation allows a precise prosthesis alignment without complete visualization of the bony landmarks during MIS THA. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} computer-navigated MIS anterior approach for THA compared to a conventional posterolateral THA technique on the restoration of physical functioning during recovery following surgery. Thirty-five patients underwent computer-navigated MIS THA via the anterior approach, and 40 patients underwent conventional THA using the conventional posterolateral approach. Gait analysis was performed preoperatively, 6 weeks, and 3 and 6 months postoperatively using a body-fixed-sensor based gait analysis system. Walking speed, step length, cadence, and frontal plane <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> of the pelvis and thorax were assessed. The same data were obtained from 30 healthy subjects. No differences were found in the recovery of spatiotemporal parameters or in <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> of the pelvis and thorax following the computer-navigated MIS anterior approach or the conventional posterolateral approach.

40|$|Assessments of body-segment <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> {{are very}} {{important}} in the rehabilitation process. Head <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> are measured and analyzed for use in studies of stability and posture. However, there is no methodology for assessing <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> of the head, {{and it has not}} been verified whether data measured by fundamentally different MoCap systems will lead to the same results. In this study, we used a camera system and a 3 DOF orientation tracker placed on the subject’s head, and measured inclination (roll) and flexion (pitch) during quiet stance. The total length and the mean velocity of the traces of the pitch versus roll plots were used to measure and analyze head orientation. Using these methods, we are able to model the distribution of the measured 2 D data, and to evaluate stability and posture. The results show that the total lengths and the mean velocities related to the 3 DOF orientation tracker do not differ significantly from the total lengths and the mean velocities of traces related to the IR medical camera. We also found that the systems are not interchangeable, and that the same type of system must be used each time. The designed methods can be used for studies not only of head movements but also of movements of other segments of the human body, and can be used to compare other types of MoCap systems, depending on the requirements for a specific rehabilitation examination...|$|R

Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2011; 90 : 681 - 687. This study examined the accuracy and reproducibility of a body-fixed sensor-based assessment for quantifying frontal plane <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> of the (upper) thorax and pelvis of patients with hip osteoarthritis at different walking speeds. To evaluate accuracy, the <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> of sensors attached to the thorax and pelvis of three patients were compared with results based on an optical motion analysis system. Accuracy was high, with small and consistent mean differences (< 1. 0 degree) and corresponding standard deviations (< 1. 3 degrees) between optical motion analysis system and body-fixed sensor data. To evaluate reproducibility, <b>angular</b> trunk <b>movements</b> were assessed twice in 15 patients. Reproducibility was high (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 97), and {{the values of the}} mean differences between the test and retest were small, with the 95 % confidence interval containing zero. This body-fixed sensor-based assessment is an accurate and reproducible method for quantifying frontal plane compensatory trunk movements during gait of patients with hip osteoarthritis at different walking speeds...|$|R

40|$|Despite Saussure's famous {{observation}} that sound-meaning relationships are in principle arbitrary, {{we now have}} a substantial body of evidence that sounds themselves can have meanings, patterns often referred to as "sound symbolism". Previous studies have found that particular sounds can be associated with particular meanings, and also with particular static visual shapes. Less well studied is the association between sounds and dynamic movements. Using a free elicitation method, the current experiment shows that several sound symbolic associations between sounds and dynamic movements exist: (1) front vowels {{are more likely to be}} associated with small movements than with large movements; (2) front vowels are more likely to be associated with <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> than with round movements; (3) obstruents are more likely to be associated with <b>angular</b> <b>movements</b> than with round movements; (4) voiced obstruents are more likely to be associated with large movements than with small movements. All of these results are compatible with the results of the previous studies of sound symbolism using static images or meanings. Overall, the current study supports the hypothesis that particular dynamic motions can be associated with particular sounds. Building on the current results, we discuss a possible practical application of these sound symbolic associations in sports instructions...|$|R
