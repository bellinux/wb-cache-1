5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient. The differences, which are quite significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index.|$|E
5|$|Two {{cases from}} Liberia {{experienced}} severe neurological symptoms, including ptosis, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> distress. A child in Ghana died within 20 minutes after being {{bitten by a}} snake suspected to be from this species.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures {{have been reported}} in about a third of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Elemental {{fluorine}} {{is highly}} toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Racz {{moved to}} the United States for an {{anesthesiology}} residency at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York.

5|$|In {{the first}} volume, the {{specimens}} {{of the cabinet}} were divided into fifteen sections: healthy bones, diseased bones, soft parts about the bones, heart and blood vessels, organs of sense, vocal <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> organs, alimentary canal, organs accessory to the alimentary canal, urinary organs, female organs of generation, male organs of generation, utero-gestation, monstrosities, and parasites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful. Among the first applications to reach clinical trials were in the treatment of macular degeneration <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> syncytial virus. RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E
5|$|Lead forms {{a variety}} of {{compounds}} and exists in the environment in various forms. Features of poisoning differ {{depending on whether the}} agent is an organic compound (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic lead compounds as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly.|$|E
5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are {{the leading cause of}} death in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E

The son of a middle class family, Scrushy's father, Gerald Scrushy, worked as a cash {{register}} repairman and his mother, Grace Scrushy, worked as a nurse <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> therapist. At an early age, Scrushy taught himself {{to play the piano}} and guitar and was earning money doing odd jobs {{by the time he was}} 12 years old. Scrushy, who then went by his middle name Marin, attended school until he was 17. He dropped out prior to graduating from Parrish High School and married.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{is used in}} {{traditional}} medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful {{in the treatment of}} high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every breath but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each breath), worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> arrest eventually follow.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, abrupt discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from abrupt withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye <b>and</b> <b>respiratory</b> system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E
