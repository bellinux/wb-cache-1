50|$|Bees {{and other}} pollinators face {{a higher risk}} of {{extinction}} due to loss of habitat and access to natural food sources. The global dependency on livestock and agriculture has rendered no less than 50% of the earths landmass uninhabitable for bees. The agricultural practice of planting one crop (monoculture) in a given area year after year leads to extreme malnourishment. Regardless if the planted crop does flower and provide food for the bee, the bee will still be malnourished because a single plant cannot meet the nutrient requirements. Furthermore, the crops needed to support livestock (primarily cattle) tend to be grains which do not provide nectar.

Zebra mussels foul {{a wide array}} of submerged substrates including rock surfaces, plants, native bivalves, dock walls, and watercraft. Fouling of water intake pipes and <b>associated</b> <b>installations</b> can severely impair water delivery to hydroelectric, municipal and industrial users making proactive or reactive control measures necessary. Mussels increase water clarity by removing suspended clay, silt, bacteria, phytoplankton, and small zooplankton. This focuses nutrients into the bottom of lakes away from much of the food chain and also causes increases in cyanobacterial toxins due to increased growth of blue-green algae. However, mussels are exploited by a host of predators, most notably waterfowl, fish, and crayfish. They can return some of the nutrients to the food chain, but unfortunately even with predation much of the nutrients remain at the bottoms of lakes. We have tested one crayfish species (Orconectes propinquus) for feeding responses when given an opportunity to interact with zebra mussels (5 consecutive days). Crayfish did ingest zebra mussels and males ate more than females. Moreover, all crayfish selected smaller zebra mussels as a preferential prey item...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{expansion}} of zebra mussel distribution into inland wa-terways of North America portends significant abiotic and biotic changes mediated {{either directly or}} indirectly by Dreissena. Dreissena fouls a wide array of submerged substrates including rock surfaces, macrophytes, native molluscs, canal and dock walls, and watercraft and motor out-drives. Fouling of water intake pipes and <b>associated</b> <b>installations</b> can se-verely impair water delivery to hydroelectric, municipal and industrial users, necessitating proactive or reactive control measures. Mussels in-crease water clarity by removing suspended clay, silt, bacteria, phyto-plankton, and small zooplankton. Clear water phases associated with Dreissena grazing may exceed in magnitude and duration those generated by zooplankton grazing. Enhanced water clarity increases light transmit-tance and growth of benthic plants. Some benthic invertebrates {e. g., unionid molluscs) are adversely affected by Dreissena, whereas others, including amphipod crustaceans, exploit structure associated with or wastes generated by zebra mussels. Dreissena is exploited by a host of predators, most notably waterfowl, fish and crayfish. Waterfowl predators that consume contaminated Dreissena have elevated concentrations of organic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyl compounds. Invasion of shallow lakes and ponds by Dreissena may divert production and biomass from pelagic to benthic foodwebs, shifting ecosystems to an alternative state.

As it is impossible to restore the normal environment once the work is finished, the present state should be documented, and information about how the formation of the area and its periglacial landforms took place in the past (e. g., with ice samples) should be gained. During the years after the construction, further research must be conducted to evaluate the degree of change. The research within this article contributes to this knowledge, and preliminary results are presented. Study Site During construction for a new ski run at the Gornergrat (Zermatt, Swiss Alps), diverse exposures of ground-ice were created. The site (3135 m a. s. l) is located in the southern Swiss Alps and is part of the Matter Valley. The Zermatt region has a continental climate with 610 mm annual precipitation (MeteoSwiss 30 -year average 1961 – 1990) and strong direct solar radiation. Located on the northern slopes of the east–west running crest between Gornergrat and Hohtälli (3286 m a. s. l.) is the area called “Kelle ” (Fig. 1). Here, the ski run is constructed within the discontinous permafrost zone, which can be expected between 2600 and 3500 m a. s. l., according to King (1996). Regarding permafrost distribution, measurements of the ground surface temperature (GST) and the basal temperature of the snow (BTS), as well as permafrost models have contributed to knowledge about this area (Gruber 2000...|$|E

40|$|A scale {{inhibitor}} ‘squeeze’ treatment {{is used in}} {{the oil and gas industry}} as a control measure to reduce the risk of mineral scale precipitation and deposition in the near-wellbore rock formation and <b>associated</b> <b>installations.</b> One of the determining factors in a successful squeeze job is the potential of formation rock to adsorb {{scale inhibitor}} (SI); the higher the adsorption, the better the treatment. This paper investigates the potential of employing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to increase the adsorption of a common SI (polyphosphinocarboxylic acid, PPCA) on formation rock as part of a new methodology forming a ‘Nanotechnology-Assisted Squeeze Treatment’ (NAST). The focus here is assessing the adsorption potential of PPCA on CNTs for the purpose of creating a longer-lasting squeeze treatment. Analyses using various techniques including Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Raman Spectroscopy are presented, and results indicate that up to 180 mg/g of PPCA adsorbed on CNTs, with strong bonding, which is significantly higher than the 1 mg/g adsorption of PPCA on crushed formation rock. Adsorption of PPCA decreases with increasing temperature of the solution, indicating an exothermic reaction. The impact of water salinity on adsorption is also considered, with calcium producing a positive effect on adsorption and sodium the opposite. It is also illustrated that a good dispersion of CNTs in the solution can dramatically increase the adsorption due to the exposure of higher surface area to PPCA in the solution. The influence of using CNTs on adsorption of SI onto internal surface of sandstone rock were evaluated using coreflood tests with simplified brines. The results demonstrate the potential of employing CNTs to increase adsorption of SI in squeeze treatments and possibly to improve the squeeze treatment lifetime...|$|E

This paper presents {{details of a}} research project containing small-scale and full-scale experiments on X 80 line pipe specimen containing girth welds. Initial defects are introduced on the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and Weld Metal (WM) of the girth welds prior to the test {{in order to understand}} their fracture behaviour. The full-scale experimental program includes four-point bending tests with and without internal pressure applied, and reeling tests. Tensile properties of base metal, WM and HAZ are measured. Fracture toughness tests of WM and HAZ are also carried out. No through-thickness crack growth has been observed in the reeling tests and bending tests without internal pressure. However, some bending tests with internal pressure have seen crack growing through the thickness of the girth weld. Results from this study have shed light on the extent of crack growth in the girth welds of X 80 pipes as influenced by their initial size, location, and internal pressurization...|$|R
