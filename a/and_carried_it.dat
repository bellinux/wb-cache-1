During one photo session, Cormier lifted a telephone pole from the ground <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> around while posing for pictures. According to one story, he once got upset with a horse that refused to cooperate and knocked it down with one punch.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E

5|$|Her {{relationship}} with the Jesuits was complex. Members of this order educated her, served as her confessors, and supervised the religious education of her eldest son. The Jesuits were powerful and influential {{in the early years}} of Maria Theresa's reign. However, the queen's ministers convinced her that the order posed a danger to her monarchical authority. Not without much hesitation and regret, she issued a decree which removed them from all the institutions of the monarchy, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> out thoroughly. She forbade the publication of Pope Clement XIII's bull which was in favour of the Jesuits and promptly confiscated their property when Pope Clement XIV suppressed the order.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Six days later, on {{the advice}} of Stepan Khojiants, the village chief of Akhuri, the ascent was {{attempted}} from the northwest side. After reaching an elevation of , they turned back because they did not reach the summit before sundown. They reached the summit on their third attempt at 3:15 p.m. on October 9, 1829. Abovian dug a hole in the ice and erected a wooden cross facing north. Abovian picked up a chunk of ice from the summit <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> down with him in a bottle, considering the water holy. On November 8, Parrot and Abovian climbed up Lesser Ararat. Years later, in 1845, the German mineralogist Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich climbed Ararat with Abovian. Abovian's third and last ascent of Ararat was with the Englishman Henry Danby Seymour in 1846.|$|E

5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'.

5|$|Following the Nevada kickoff, Turner handed off to Scott, {{who picked}} up two yards. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Turner connected with Torrey Smith on a 26-yard toss for a third-down conversion. Scott then rushed for three {{yards to the}} Nevada 49-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> again down the middle, this time breaking free for a 49-yard touchdown run. On the following Nevada series, Kaepernick mounted a 38-yard drive to the Maryland 34-yard line, but failed to convert on fourth and12. On the next series, Da'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times in succession to pick up first downs with rushes of 11, 23, 30yards and a touchdown on a two-yard run. The score and extra point gave Maryland a two-touchdown lead, 42–28. Nevada's offense returned to the field with 7:44remaining {{in the game and}} used almost three minutes in a 37-yard drive that culminated in an interception by Maryland safety Jeff Allen on the Maryland 38-yard line. After no gain on a rush by running back Morgan Green, Maryland attempted an end-around. Turner was stepped on, and the handoff was botched. The intended recipient, Heyward-Bey, dropped the ball but managed to recover it for a loss of six yards. After Nevada called a time out, Green rushed for a five-yard gain. Nevada expended its last remaining time out to stop the clock with 4:06left. Maryland punted it away on fourth down with 11yards to go.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech won the {{ceremonial}} pregame coin toss to determine first possession {{and decided to}} kick off to Florida State. Kickoff returner Lonnie Pryor mishandled the football, but quickly recovered the loose ball <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> to the Florida State 33-yard line, where the Seminoles began their first offensive drive. On the first play of the game, quarterback E. J. Manuel completed a 29-yard pass to wide receiver Taiwan Easterling, driving the Seminoles into Virginia Tech's defensive half. A short rush and a subsequent 12-yard pass gave Florida State a first down near the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Short rushes pushed Florida State's offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone, but the Seminoles were unable to gain another first down. Placekicker Dustin Hopkins came {{on the field and}} kicked a 32-yard field goal, giving Florida State a 3–0 lead with 11:43 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity to the words of Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans.|$|E

The flag was issued to the unit on September 20, 1863, {{on the field of}} Chickamauga, and was probably carried until approximately 1 January 1865. Private Spencer Young, who was wounded carrying the flag in the Battle of the Wilderness, saved the flag <b>and</b> <b>carried</b> <b>it</b> back to the state.
