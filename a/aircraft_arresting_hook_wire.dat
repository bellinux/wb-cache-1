40|$|BACKGROUND: Video-assisted {{thoracic}} surgery (VATS) is currently performed to diagnose and treat {{solitary pulmonary nodules}} (SPN). However, the intra-operative identification of deep nodules can be challenging with VATS as the lung is difficult to palpate. The aim {{of the study was}} to report the utility and the results of pre-operative computed tomography (CT) -guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization of SPN. METHODS: All records of the patients undergoing CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to VATS resection for SPN between 2002 and 2013 were reviewed. The efficacy in localizing the nodule, <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> complications, necessity to convert VATS to thoracotomy and the histology of SPN are reported. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-one patients (90 females, mean age 63 y, range 28 - 82 y) underwent 187 pulmonary resections after CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization. The mean SPN diameter was 10. 3 mm (range: 4 - 29 mm). The mean distance of the lesion from the pleural surface was 11. 6 mm (range: 0 - 45 mm). The mean time interval from <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> insertion to VATS resection was 224 min (range 54 - 622 min). <b>Hook</b> <b>wire</b> complications included pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage in 4 patients (2. 1 %) and mild parenchymal haemorrhage in 11 (5. 9 %) patients. Migration of the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> occurred in 7 patients (3. 7 %) although it did not affect the success of VATS resection (nodule location guided by the lung puncture site). Three patients underwent additional wedge resection by VATS during the same procedure because no lesion was identified in the surgical specimen. Conversion thoracotomy was required in 13 patients (7 %) for centrally localized lesions (6 patients) and pleural adhesions (7 patients). The mean operative time was 60 min (range 18 - 135 min). Pathological examination revealed a malignant lesion in 107 patients (59 %). The diagnostic yield was 98. 3 %. CONCLUSION: VATS resection for SPN after CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization for SPN is safe and allows for proper diagnosis with a low thoracotomy conversion rate...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the {{factors related to}} the successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent nodule excision. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 181 patients who had undergone computed tomography–guided nodule localization using <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> and subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection for lung nodules. The demographic factors, nodule factors, and technical factors were reviewed to determine what affects effective nodule localization for video-assisted thoracic surgery resection using both univariate and multivariate models. ResultsA total of 174 patients were included in our study. Successful localization was accomplished in 166 patients (95 %). Univariate analysis implicated patient age, nodule solidity, zonal location, and a sufficient distance between the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> tip and pleural surface as significant factors for successful localization. Multivariate analysis focused on {{the distance between the}} wire tip and pleural surface as the sole independent factor for successful localization (P = . 012). ConclusionsThe distance between the <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> tip and pleural surface was the major significant factor for successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection. Thus, the localization of a <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> adjacent to a target nodule with sufficient depth from the pleural surface is crucial {{to the success of the}} procedure...|$|R

40|$|Background/PurposeHistologic {{diagnosis}} of suspicious small subpleural lung lesions {{is difficult and}} often impossible using existing image-guided needle biopsy techniques including video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Preoperative lung lesion localization provides a more obvious target to facilitate intraoperative resection. This study reviewed the indications, results and complications of CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization for subpleural lung lesions in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MethodsBetween February 2001 and January 2007, 41 patients (20 males, 21 females; mean age, 52. 5 ± 5. 1 years) with 43 subpleural pulmonary lesions underwent preoperative CT-guided double-thorn <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection. Nodule diameters ranged from 2 mm to 26 mm (mean, 9. 7 ± 1. 6 mm). The distance of the lung lesions from the nearest pleural surfaces ranged from 2 mm to 30 mm (mean, 9. 6 ± 2. 0 mm). Patients then received VATS within 5 hours. The efficacy of preoperative localization was evaluated in terms of procedure time, VATS success rate and associated complications of localization. ResultsForty-three wedge resections of the lungs containing 43 subpleural lung lesions as guided or assisted by the inserted <b>hook</b> <b>wires</b> were successfully performed in 41 VATS procedures (41 of 43 procedures, 95. 3 %). The mean procedure time for preoperative CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization was 30. 4 ± 2. 8 minutes. Eight patients had asymptomatic minimal pneumothoraces (18. 6 %); six patients had minimal needle tract parenchymal hemorrhages (13. 9 %) and one patient (2. 3 %) had an estimated 100 mL of hemothorax due to a small intercostal artery bleed that was cauterized during operation. The mean procedure time for VATS was 103 ± 9. 7 minutes (range, 44 – 198 minutes). Pathologic examination revealed seven primary lung cancers, 11 metastases, one hemangioma, 19 definite non-neoplastic pathologies, two nonspecific chronic inflammation, and three metallic foreign bodies. Diagnostic yield was 95 %. No major complications related to the preoperative <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization and VATS were noted.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Localization of pulmonary ground glass small nodule is the technical difficulty of minimally invasive operation resection. The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate the value of intraoperative computed tomography (CT) -guided localization using a hook-wire system for small ground glass opacity (GGO) in minimally invasive resection, as well as to discuss the necessity and feasibility of surgical resection of small GGOs (< 10 mm) through a minimally invasive approach. Methods The records of 32 patients with 41 small GGOs who underwent intraoperative CT-guided double-thorn <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection from October 2009 to October 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients received video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) within 10 min after wire localization. The efficacy of intraoperative localization was evaluated in terms of procedure time, VATS success rate, and associated complications of localization. Results A total of 32 patients (15 males and 17 females) underwent 41 VATS resections, with 2 simultaneous nodule resections performed in 3 patients, 3 lesion resections in 1 patient, and 5 lesions in a patient. Nodule diameters ranged from 2 mm- 10 mm (mean: 5 mm). The distance of lung lesions from the nearest pleural surfaces ranged within 5 mm- 24 mm (mean: 12. 5 mm). All resections of lesions guided by the inserted <b>hook</b> <b>wires</b> were successfully performed by VATS (100 % success rate). The mean procedure time for the CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization was 8. 4 min (range: 4 min- 18 min). The mean procedure time for VATS was 32 min (range: 14 min- 98 min). The median hospital time was 8 d (range: 5 d- 14 d). Results of pathological examination revealed 28 primary lung cancers, 9 atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, and 4 nonspecific chronic inflammations. No major complication related to the intraoperative <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization and VATS was noted. Conclusion Intraoperative CT-guided <b>hook</b> <b>wire</b> localization is useful, particularly in small GGO localization in VATS wedge resection and has a significantly low rate of minor complications.

Methods: This was a descriptive study conducted at the Department of Radiology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. All patients undergoing needle localization biopsy of a nonpalpable breast lesion under mammographic or ultrasound guidance between January 2009 to December 2010 were included in the study. Patients with incomplete medical records were excluded. All patients&rsquo; mammograms or ultrasound were categorized using BI-RADS&reg; assessment categories. The percentages of benign and malignant lesions were determined by pathological examination of surgically removed specimens. A correlation was sought between preoperative imaging assessment and the final diagnosis. The complications associated with the procedure were also recorded. Results: A total of 151 biopsies were carried out, of which 80 were performed under mammographic guidance and 71 were performed under ultrasound guidance. The mean age of the patients was 51. 89 years. The overall malignancy rate was 25. 16 %. Of 93 cases reported radiologically as malignant, 60 turned out to be malignant, and of the 58 cases reported as benign on imaging, three proved to be malignant on histopathology. The sensitivity of imaging findings was 95 % and the specificity was 62 %. The malignancy rate was 5 % for benign lesions and 64 % for malignant lesions, respectively. There were no complications related to wire localization, and only two patients had minor complications following surgical excision, giving a complication rate of 1. 32 %.
