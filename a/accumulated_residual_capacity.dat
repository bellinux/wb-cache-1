40|$|Objective: Heptafluoropropane is an {{inert gas}} commercially used as {{propellant}} for inhalers. Since heptafluoropropane {{can be detected}} in low concentrations, {{it could also be}} used as a tracer gas to measure functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to validate functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> measurements by heptafluoropropane wash-in/wash-out (0. 8 %) during mechanical ventilation in small, surfactant-depleted lungs using a newborn piglet model. Design: Prospective laboratory and animal trial. Setting: Animal laboratory in a university setting. Subjects: Sixteen newborn piglets (age < 12 hrs, median weight 1390 g [705 – 4200 g]) before and after surfactant depletion by lung lavage. Interventions: Heptafluoropropane was measured with an infrared mainstream sensor connected with the flow sensor of the Dräger Babylog 8000. Accuracy and precision of the measurement technique were tested in a mechanical lung model with a volume range from 11 to 35 mL. Furthermore changes of functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> were assessed in vivo by variation of ventilatory variables. Measurements and Main Results: In vitro the absolute error of functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> was < 1 mL (relative errors < 3 %) with a coefficient of variation < 4 %. The coefficient of variation of consecutive in vivo measurements was only slightly higher (< 5. 1 %). After lung lavage, the functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> decreased despite increased ventilator pressures. In healthy lungs, the increase in peak inflation pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure had only a moderate, non-significant effect on functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity,</b> whereas in surfactant-depleted lungs an elevated PEEP increased functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> significantly. Conclusions: Heptafluoropropane is a suitable tracer gas for precise functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> measurements tested in vitro and allows for reproducible measurements in ventilated small lungs without any adverse effects on mechanical ventilation. The sensitivity of the method is sufficiently high to demonstrate the effect of changes in ventilatory settings on the functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{characterize}} {{factors that}} contribute to lung function impairment after cardiopulmonary bypass, we assessed functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and ventilation homogeneity during the perioperative period in children with congenital heart disease who are to undergo surgical repair. MethodsFunctional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and lung clearance index were measured by using a sulfur hexafluoride washout technique in 24 children (aged 0 – 10 years). Measurements of functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and ventilation distribution were performed after induction of anesthesia, at different stages of the surgical procedure, and up to 90 minutes after skin closure. Anesthesia was standardized, and ventilator settings, including the fraction of inspired oxygen, were kept constant throughout the study period. ResultsSternotomy and retractor insertion led to a significant increase in functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> (mean [SD], 24 % [14 %]), followed by a similar percentage decrease in the resting volume after a significant reduction in pulmonary blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass with aortic clamping. Although reestablishing pulmonary blood flow increased functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> (10 % [6 %]), chest closure led to a decrease in functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> of 36 % (14 %) that only slightly improved during the first 90 minutes after surgical intervention. Changes in lung clearance index were affected conversely compared with changes in functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> at all assessment times. ConclusionsThese results confirmed that chest wall condition and pulmonary circulation affect lung volumes and ventilation homogeneity. Although opening of the chest wall improved alveolar recruitment and ventilation homogeneity, blood flow appeared essential for alveolar stability, presumably by exerting a tethering force caused by the filled capillaries on the alveolar walls and therefore contributing to an increase in resting lung volume...|$|R

Different techniques of body positioning might be an important confounding factor. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of two different {{prone position}}ing techniques on functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and ventilation distribution in anesthetized, preschool-aged children. DESIGN: Functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and lung clearance index, a measure of ventilation homogeneity, were calculated using a sulfur-hexafluoride multibreath washout technique. After intubation, measurements were taken in the supine position and, in random order, in the flat prone position and the augmented prone position (gel pads supporting the pelvis and the upper thorax). SETTING: Pediatric anesthesia unit of university hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty preschool children without cardiopulmonary disease undergoing elective surgery. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean (range) age was 48. 5 (24 - 80) months, weight 17. 2 (10. 5 - 26. 9) kg, functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> (mean +/- SD) 22. 9 +/- 6. 2 ml. kg (- 1) in the supine position and 23. 3 +/- 5. 6 ml. kg (- 1) in the flat prone position, while lung clearance indices were 8. 1 +/- 2. 3 vs. 7. 9 +/- 2. 3, respectively. In contrast, functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> increased to 27. 6 +/- 6. 5 ml. kg (- 1) (p> 0. 001) in the augmented prone position while at the same time the lung clearance index decreased to 6. 7 +/- 0. 9 (p> 0. 001).

40|$|The {{inspired}} sinewave {{technique is}} a noninvasive method to measure airway dead space, functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity,</b> pulmonary blood flow, and lung inhomogeneity simultaneously. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the repeatability and accuracy of the current device prototype in measuring functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity,</b> and also participant comfort when using such the device. To assess within-session repeatability, six sinewave measurements were taken over 2 -hour period in 17 healthy volunteers. To assess day-to-day repeatability, measurements were taken over 16 days in 3 volunteers. To assess accuracy, sinewave measurements were compared to body plethysmography in 44 healthy volunteers. Finally, 18 volunteers who experienced the inspired sinewave device, body plethysmography and spirometry were asked to rate the comfort of each technique on a scale of 1 - 10. The repeatability coefficients for dead space, functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity,</b> and blood flow were 48. 7 ml, 0. 48 L, and 2. 4 L/min respectively. Bland-Altman analyses showed a mean BIAS(SD) of - 0. 68 (0. 42) L for functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> when compared with body plethysmography. 14 out of 18 volunteers rated the inspired sinewave device as their preferred technique. The repeatability and accuracy of functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> measurements were found to be as good as other techniques in the literature. The high level of comfort and the non-requirement of patient effort meant that, if further refined, the inspired sinewave technique could be an attractive solution for difficult patient groups such as very young children, elderly, and ventilated patients...|$|R

40|$|Caudal block {{results in}} a motor {{blockade}} that can reduce abdominal wall tension. This could interact with the balance between chest wall and lung recoil pressure and tension of the diaphragm, which determines the static resting volume of the lung. On this rationale, we hypothesised that caudal block causes an increase in functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and ventilation distribution in anaesthetised children. Fifty-two healthy children (15 - 30 kg, 3 - 8 years of age) undergoing elective surgery with general anaesthesia and caudal block were studied and randomly allocated to two groups: caudal block or control. Following induction of anaesthesia, the first measurement was obtained in the supine position (baseline). All children were {{then turned to the}} left lateral position and patients in the caudal block group received a caudal block with bupivacaine. No intervention took place in the control group. After 15 nun in the supine position, the second assessment was performed. Functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> and parameters of ventilation distribution were calculated by a blinded reviewer. Functional <b>residual</b> <b>capacity</b> was similar at baseline in both groups. In the caudal block group, the capacity increased significantly (p < 0. 0001) following caudal block, while in the control group, it remained unchanged.
