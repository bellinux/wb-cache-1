5|$|Chains of Promathia {{revolves}} around an Elvaan girl named Prishe {{and the dead}} Twilight God Promathia, who had originally cursed the Zilart race, and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection. The wyrmking Bahamut is involved in these events, and intends to destroy Vana'diel to prevent Promathia from <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> life of the world.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the sticky, {{modified}} bracts of Passiflora foetida {{have been}} investigated for their carnivorous ability. A 1995 paper published in the Journal of Biosciences detailed {{the evidence that the}} glandular bracts played a distinct role in defense of the flower and were also capable of digesting captured prey and <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> nutrients.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} revived {{under the control}} of the Network SouthEast sector of British Rail. The {{introduction}} of the inter-modal and unlimited use Capitalcard (now known as the Travelcard) led to a sharp rise in commuters into London, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> spare capacity at Paddington and Baker Street and eliminating the possibility of Marylebone's services being diverted.|$|E

5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It involves <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> souls of enemies {{in order to}} gain additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as strong as Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. This network needs {{to be capable of}} <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E

5|$|The West Florida Seminary, {{also known}} as the Florida State Seminary, opened for classes in Tallahassee in 1857, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> Florida Institute, which had been {{established}} as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in the city. The former Florida Institute property, located where the historic Westcott Building now stands, is the oldest continuously used site of higher education in Florida. The area, slightly west of the state Capitol, was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee. In 1858 the seminary absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy, established in 1843, and became coeducational.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents {{responded by}} {{throwing}} a grenade at the Marines. The two Marines with Sgt. Peralta {{tried to get}} out of the room but could not. Sgt. Peralta was still conscious on the floor and despite his wounds was able to reach for the grenade and pull it under his body <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> majority of the lethal blast and shrapnel which killed him instantly, but saved the lives of his fellow marines.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E

5|$|On 5 October, an operationally unnamed {{subtropical}} storm {{which had}} gone unnoticed by the NHC was absorbed by a temperate frontal low, which {{was moving to}} the southeast over the Azores. The low pressure system gained a more concentrated circulation and lost its frontal structure after <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> subtropical storm. The developing system became a subtropical storm itself early on 8 October 580miles (930km) southeast of Lajes in the Azores. However, the NHC decided not to name the system Vince at the time, because the water temperature was too low for normal development for a tropical cyclone. The storm gradually gained the tropical characteristics of symmetry and a warm inner core and became a tropical storm the next day. Its transformation to a tropical system occurred over water cooler than 24°C (75°F), much colder than the 26.5°C (80°F) usually required for tropical development.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|RAAF squadrons began {{adopting}} specialised {{roles in}} the early 1930s, No.1 Squadron becoming No.1 Single-Engined Bomber Squadron. By November 1935 it {{was made up of}} two flights of newly delivered Hawker Demon fighter-bombers, and one of Wapitis. In December 1935 it was augmented by No.1 FTS's Fighter Squadron and its six Bristol Bulldogs, which were redesignated fighter-bombers. Nos.21 and 22 (Cadre) Squadrons were formed on 20April 1936 at Laverton and Richmond, respectively, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> CAF personnel of Nos.1 and 3Squadrons, which became PAF units. The same day, No.1 Squadron was renamed No.1 (Fighter Bomber) Squadron. This reorganisation temporarily denuded No.1 Squadron of most of its aircraft, leaving only AFlight, with four Bulldogs and a Wapiti, in operation. The Wapiti was transferred to No.1 FTS in July, {{and by the end of}} the month the squadron's complement of aircraft stood at four Bulldogs and one Moth.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens {{played their}} first game on January 5, 1910, coached by Jack Laviolette. Before a sellout crowd of 3,000, they {{defeated}} Cobalt 7–6 in overtime. The victory was erased {{from the history}} books shortly after, as the CHA collapsed after only two weeks of play, and the NHA chose to restart the season after <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> CHA's Ottawa Senators and the Montreal Shamrocks. The Canadiens' {{first game of the}} new season was played January 19, a 9–4 loss to the Renfrew Creamery Kings. They lost three more games before finally recording their first victory of the new season on February 7, when they defeated the Haileybury Hockey Club by a score of 9–7. They won only two of their 12 games that season, and finished last in the eight-team league.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of the area that is now the site of Cooper were the Caddo Indians, who settled large portions of eastern Texas as early as 800 AD. The Caddo were highly advanced, living in large wooden structures, and were skilled farmers. The first European to visit the area was French explorer François Hervey, who discovered the area around 1750. However, a few decades later, some of the Indians caught European diseases and along with attacks from neighboring Indian tribes, forced the Caddo {{out of the area}} around Cooper. Around 1820, Delaware, Quapaw, and Seminole tribes settled in the area. In 1836, the Republic of Texas officially recognized the region around Cooper as part of Red River County. In 1840, Lamar County was formed, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> Cooper area. However, just six years later, the region was designated as part of the newly formed Hopkins County.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> blood that flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E
50|$|Height is {{gained by}} placing a boulder on any visible square, and putting a Synthoid on the boulder. The player may then {{transfer}} consciousness to the new Synthoid, and <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> old one. Stacks of boulders of any height may be created, if the player has enough energy. In order to <b>absorb</b> <b>the</b> Sentinel, the player must create a stack of boulders of sufficient height that the Synthoid on top can {{look down on the}} Sentinel's platform. When the Sentinel has been <b>absorbed,</b> <b>the</b> player may no longer absorb any energy from the landscape, although objects may be created as normal.|$|R

50|$|On May 15, 1877, <b>the</b> PW&B {{formally}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> New Castle and Frenchtown and New Castle and Wilmington railroads, {{forming a}} branch line from Wilmington to Rodney. On May 21, 1877, it then <b>absorbed</b> <b>the</b> Southwark railroad, extending its main {{line to the}} Delaware River waterfront.|$|R
5|$|A {{high level}} of {{insulation}} was used to keep the building warm during the winter months. This approach, however, brings with it the potential problem of overheating during the summer due to solar heat gains through the glazing, body heat {{and the use of}} computers and electric lighting. Standard solutions to the problem usually involve using energy intensive HVAC systems. The Scottish Parliament Building, however, reduces the requirements for such systems to only 20% of the accommodation by a variety of strategies. Natural ventilation is used wherever possible. A computerised management system senses the temperature {{in different parts of the}} Parliament and automatically opens windows to keep the building cool. During summer months, the building opens the windows during the night time when it is unoccupied and permits the heavy concrete floors and structure to cool and rid themselves of heat absorbed during the day. This then helps to keep the building temperature down during the day by <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> excess heat from the glazing, occupants and electrical equipment. Some of the concrete floors are further cooled by water from 25metres (80ft) deep bore holes beneath the parliamentary campus which also provide water for the toilet facilities. The building achieves the highest rating in the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).|$|E
5|$|After encountering {{the three}} servile groups, the player begins {{to learn of}} a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who {{attacked}} the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user's DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island's Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> contents of canisters and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable to activate the Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed to activate the device. A Shaper named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, {{in the same manner as}} the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{took power}} upon deposing his uncle, King Andrianjafy, who had ruled over Imerina Avarandrano (Northern Imerina). Prior to Andrianampoinimerina's reign, Imerina Avarandrano had been locked in {{conflict}} with the three other neighboring provinces of the former kingdom of Imerina that had last been unified under King Andriamasinavalona a century before. Andrianampoinimerina established his capital at the fortified town of Ambohimanga, a site of great spiritual, cultural and political significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. The king's original royal lodgings can still be visited at Ambohimanga today. From this position, he progressively extended his domain first over all Imerina and then over the greater Highlands, <b>absorbing</b> <b>the</b> Betsileo, Sihanaka, Bezanozano and Bara territories. Having reigned for 23 years {{at the time of his}} death, Andrianampoinimerina had successfully reunited Imerina and vastly expanded the Merina kingdom, with the intent to ultimately unify all of Madagascar under Merina rule. His son and heir, Radama I, continued the conquests Andrianampoinimerina had begun, and over the next two decades largely achieved his father's vision.|$|E
