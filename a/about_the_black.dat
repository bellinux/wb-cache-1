5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was quite small but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show {{that most of those}} at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E

25|$|Tests of the Lense–Thirring precession, {{consisting}} of small secular precessions of {{the orbit of}} a test particle in motion around a central rotating mass, for example, a planet or a star, have been performed with the LAGEOS satellites, but many aspects of them remain controversial. The same effect may have been detected in the data of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, a former probe in orbit around Mars; also such a test raised a debate. First attempts to detect the Sun's Lense–Thirring effect on the perihelia of the inner planets have been recently reported as well. Frame dragging would cause the orbital plane of stars orbiting near a supermassive black hole to precess <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable {{within the next few}} years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity.|$|E
25|$|When the Guardian {{arrives on}} Venus, the Exo Stranger {{describes}} the Vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil. She tells them <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Garden, {{a city where}} the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and rip out its heart, {{as it is the}} only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden.|$|E

500|$|English naturalist Francis Willughby wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> stork in the 17th century, {{having seen}} one in Frankfurt.

It {{was one of}} the many species {{originally}} described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Ardea nigra. It was moved to the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson two years later. The word stork is derived from the Old English word storc, thought {{to be related to the}} Old High German storah, meaning [...] "stork", and the Old English stearc, meaning [...] "stiff".|$|E

By showing the card to Mark, {{he is willing to}} help and gives George Anna Maria's package. From Mark, he learns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Cat club.

George gains access to the Black Cat club, where he meets Duane (who he has met before in previous installments). Duane reveals that Spallaci owns the club. Afterwards, George is caught for stealing a towel and tied to a chair. Spallaci interrogates him about Anna Maria, and he overhears the recorded voice of Nico. Shots are being fired, so he thinks Nico has been killed. When he finds a way to escape, he goes for a drink, trying to forget the loss of Nico. The next day, still drunk, he arrives at Anna Maria's apartment, where Nico returns and George faints.|$|E

2500|$|Gaskell's {{novel of}} manners has the broader {{context of an}} {{industrial}} novel <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Country, where young girls (like Bessy) die of [...] "cotton consumption"; capitalists disregard legal obligations, and workers refuse prophylactic facilities, instigate strikes and foment riots (O'Farrell, 1997, p 58). It can be criticised, as Martin Dodsworth did in 1970, for giving the love affair precedence over the industrial context and for dwelling on the emotional conflict between Margaret and Thornton. However, North and South is not simply an industrial Pride and Prejudice Margaret acquires stature and a public role, challenging the Victorian idea of separate spheres (Stoneman, 1987, p.167). She befriends Bessy Higgins (a young, working-class woman), gradually abandons her aversion [...] "shoppy people" [...] and – recognising Thornton's qualities, crosses social classes to consider herself [...] "not good enough" [...] for him. Although the novel ends in Harley Street (where it began), Margaret's estrangement from the vain, superficial world of her cousin Edith and Henry Lennox is emphasised by her choice of Thornton and Milton (Pollard, 1967, p.111).|$|E

Of these, A Christmas Carol was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to [...] "strike a sledge hammer blow" [...] for the poor.
