25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The <b>acceleration</b> <b>rate</b> of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back to reduce speed.|$|E

500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (yawing) as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. Yawing would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out.

At twenty seconds after missile detonation a click was heard in the cabin, which is identified as the [...] "automatic pilot disconnect warning" [...] sound. Either the pilot or co-pilot had disconnected the autopilot and was manually thrusting the control column forward in order to bring the plane lower. Though the autopilot had been turned off, manual mode did not begin functioning for another twenty seconds.

The study aimed to analyze driver performance in the tangent–curve–tangent transition and verify the assumption of constant speed in a curve that is commonly used in the operating speed profiles; test whether the 85 th percentile of <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration <b>rates</b> experienced by drivers and the <b>acceleration</b> and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> obtained from the operating speeds are equivalent; find the explanatory variables associated with the 85 th percentile of deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> experienced by drivers when approaching and departing horizontal curves and provide predicting models of these rates. Methods: A driving simulator study was carried out. Drivers’ speeds were recorded on 26 configurations of the tangent–curve–tangent transition of 3 2 -lane rural roads implemented in the CRISS (Inter-University Research Center for Road Safety) driving simulator; 856 speed profiles were analyzed. Results: The main results were the following: The simplified assumption of the current operating speed profiles that the speed on the circular curve is constant and equal to that at midpoint can be considered admissible; The 85 th percentile of deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> exhibited by each driver best reflect the actual driving performance in the tangent–curve–tangent transition; Two models that predict the expected 85 th percentile of the deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> experienced by drivers were developed.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{developed}} operating speed prediction models. Most {{of the models}} are based on spot speed data, collected by radar guns, pavement sensors, and similar mechanisms. Unfortunately, these data collection methods force the users to assume some invalid assumptions in driver behavior modeling: constant operating speed throughout horizontal curves and occurrence of acceleration and deceleration only on tangents. In this study, an instrumented vehicle with GPS continuous speed tracking was used to analyze driver behavior in terms of speed choice and deceleration or acceleration performance and to develop operating speed prediction models. The data {{used in the study}} were from a field experiment conducted in Italy on the rural motorway A 16 (Naples–Avellino).

The study results showed that (a) the drivers’ speed was not constant along curves, (b) the individual drivers’ maximum speed reduction was greater than the operating speed difference in the tangent-to-curve transition, and (c) the deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> experienced by individual drivers were greater than the deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> used to draw operating speed profiles...|$|R

40|$|The rate {{at which}} {{particles}} are accelerated by the first-order Fermi mechanism in shocks depends on the angle,, that the upstream magnetic field makes with the shock normal. The greater the obliquity the greater the rate, and in quasi-perpendicular shocks rates can be hundreds of times higher than those seen in parallel shocks. In many circumstances pertaining to evolving shocks (, supernova blast waves and interplanetary traveling shocks), high <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> imply high maximum particle energies and obliquity effects may have important astrophysical consequences. However, as is demonstrated here, the efficiency for injecting thermal particles into the acceleration mechanism also depends strongly on obliquity and, in general, varies inversely with. The degree of turbulence and the resulting cross-field diffusion strongly influences both injection efficiency and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates.</b> The test particle simulation of shock acceleration used here assumes large-angle scattering, computes particle orbits exactly in shocked, laminar, non-relativistic flows, and calculates the injection efficiency {{as a function of}} obliquity, Mach number, and degree of turbulence. We find that turbulence must be quite strong for high Mach number, highly oblique shocks to inject significant numbers of thermal particles and that only modest gains in <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> can be expected for strong oblique shocks over parallel ones if the only source of seed particles is the thermal background.

40|$|To improve design {{consistency}} of existing and new roads, several studies developed operating speed prediction models and investigated drivers’ speed behaviour. Most {{of the existing}} models are based on spot speed data assuming constant operating speed throughout the horizontal curves and occurrence of acceleration and deceleration only on tangents. To overcome limitations associated with these hypotheses, this study investigated continuous speed profiles of individual drivers by a driving simulator experiment carried out on a two-lane rural highway using the VERA high-fidelity dynamic-driving simulator, operating at the Road Safety Laboratory of University of Naples Federico II (Italy). The experimental route consisted of the succession of 20 tangents with length equal to 1, 000 m and curves with radius equal to 400 m. The tangent-to-curve transition {{was carried out by}} spiral curves with parameter equal to 150 m and length equal to 55 m. Study results show that speed is not constant along the curve and deceleration rates are considerably higher than <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates.</b> These findings question the traditional hypotheses used to develop operating speed profiles. The analysis of individual drivers’ behaviour showed that: (a) 85 th percentile of the speed reduction experienced by individual drivers is more than twice as the operating speed difference in the tangent-to-curve transition, and (b) deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> experienced by the individual drivers are approximately double than deceleration and <b>acceleration</b> <b>rates</b> used to draw the operating speed profiles.
