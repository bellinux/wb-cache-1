25|$|Bred to {{work the}} fields, Picards are very {{athletic}} and revel in exercise. A good deal of exercise is therefore <b>a</b> <b>must</b> <b>for</b> this breed. Otherwise boredom will give way to destructive behavior and rowdy play. They enjoy swimming, running beside a bike, and nice long walks. The Berger Picard makes an excellent jogging companion. The breed's intelligence and sensitivity have made it increasingly popular in dog sports such as agility trials, Tracking, obedience, showmanship, Schutzhund, Flyball, Lure coursing, French Ring Sport and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Picards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.|$|E
25|$|This breed {{requires}} expert veterinary {{attention in}} areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is <b>a</b> <b>must</b> <b>for</b> these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventative measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristics of the}} American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed’s natural agility makes {{it one of the}} most capable canine climbers so good fencing is <b>a</b> <b>must</b> <b>for</b> this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is <b>a</b> <b>must.</b> <b>For</b> routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{screenplay}} {{was constantly}} being revised and re-written. Naturally, so was Mulan's characterization and {{role in the}} film. The writers wanted Mulan to represent a [...] "different kind of Disney heroine," [...] specifically described as one who [...] "didn't need a tiara, but was still {{just as much as}} graceful, strong, and courageous." [...] Between the two, Bancroft and his twin brother Tom, an animator who also worked on Mulan, have a total of seven daughters. This further inspired the filmmakers to portray Mulan as a unique heroine who is [...] "not another damsel in distress" [...] in favor of having her resemble [...] "a strong female Disney character who would truly be the heroine of her own story" [...] instead, essentially a [...] "female role model. The characteristics of strength and courage were <b>a</b> <b>must</b> <b>for</b> Mulan." [...] In an interview with The Christian Post, Bancroft elaborated on the way in which he, as the film's director, continued to consider the well-being of his two young daughters while working on Mulan, having [...] "wanted to make... a unique heroine that hadn't been seen before" [...] and provide for them [...] "someone who would be strong on her own, without a prince saving her." [...] Addressing the way in which Mulan differs from traditional Disney heroines and princesses, Bancroft explained, [...] "Most Disney heroines have an outside source that comes in and helps them change. Mulan stays consistent. From the first frame {{all the way through the}} end of the movie, her personality, her drive it all stays the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the {{commander}} of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said [...] "Do all of you understand English?" [...] The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor [...] "launched into a tirade, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating". He said [...] "I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words." [...] He decried the removal of the HNC as [...] "totally illegal", and said it had [...] "destroyed the government-making process", and that [...] "I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said [...] "...you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this." [...] Taylor believed the HNC to be {{an essential part of the}} government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was <b>a</b> <b>must.</b> <b>For</b> him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark Moyar regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail—which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south—would be suspended.|$|E
