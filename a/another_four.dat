5|$|At {{the start}} of August 1943, his tally stood at 42, but Hartmann's tally had more than doubled by the end. The Red Army began a counteroffensive {{in the region to}} contain the German {{operation}} and destroy its forces (Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev). JG52 was engaged in defensive operations throughout the month. On 1 August 1943 Hartmann became an ace-in-a day by claiming five victories. <b>Another</b> <b>four</b> followed on 3 August and five on the 4 August. Another five were claimed destroyed on the 5 August, a single on the 6 August, and a further five on 7 August. On 8 and 9 August he claimed <b>another</b> <b>four</b> Soviet fighters. Hartmann's last claim of the month came on 20th day, when he accounted for an IL-2 for his 90th victory. The next month, he was appointed Staffelkapitän of 9./JG52.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the captaincy was affecting his form. The selectors made <b>another</b> <b>four</b> changes to the team for the Third Test at Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge {{would be the}} only Louisville bridge with serious {{accidents}} during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died while working on a pier foundation when a caisson that was supposed to hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. <b>Another</b> <b>four</b> men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} phase of the war, on 24 December 1948, Iraqi planes bombed the kibbutz, hitting the {{children}}'s house, killing four children and injuring <b>another</b> <b>four.</b> Historian Yoav Gelber thinks the Iraqis wanted to attack Ramat David Airbase but hit the kibbutz instead.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. <b>Another</b> <b>four</b> or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E

5|$|The French Army {{authorised}} fresh {{attempts to}} increase {{the strength of the}} fortifications in the autumn of 1939, but severe winter weather prevented the pouring of concrete and the delivery of the necessary materials.

5|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to build on}} their success against Convoy Faith by carrying out further medium-altitude attacks on convoys. III./KG 40 sank <b>another</b> <b>four</b> ships between July and September 1943, but suffered heavy losses from Allied aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. From October, Heinkel He177s largely took over the Condors' anti-shipping role, and the last Condor sorties were made over the Atlantic in early 1944.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2015, {{the sequel}} {{was removed from}} Foxs release schedule. In May 2016, Kinberg reaffirmed his intent to make <b>another</b> Fantastic <b>Four</b> film with the same cast. Later that month, Toby Kebbell stated he had no {{interest}} in reprising his role as Dr. Doom if a sequel were to happen. Both Miles Teller and Kate Mara said that they were open to returning for a sequel. On February 24, 2017, when asked by Collider whether they would make <b>another</b> Fantastic <b>Four</b> film, Kinberg stated [...] "I have no idea. I think the truth is we would not do <b>another</b> Fantastic <b>Four</b> movie until it was ready to be made. One of the lessons we learned on that movie is {{we want to make sure}} to get it 100% right, because we will not get another chance with the fans".|$|R

5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a routine check for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square. He proceeded to pour gasoline over himself and set himself ablaze. Police officers quickly congregated on the scene and extinguished the flames. Shortly afterwards, <b>another</b> <b>four</b> people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, {{and decreased}} weight which caused less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered <b>another</b> <b>four</b> trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for <b>another</b> <b>four</b> years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>four</b> years pass, and Kioe Gie {{has become}} {{editor-in-chief}} of Kemadjoean and married Ijan Nio. He is concerned, however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming {{to make the}} paper pro-Dutch East Indies, a stance that Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home {{to ask him to}} follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 gulden offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns.|$|E
5|$|Appointed to be {{commander}} of the Austrian winter cordon, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser ordered a small assault column {{under the command of}} Colonel Wilhelm Klebeck to attack the village of Dittersbach.
