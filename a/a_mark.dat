5|$|Both ships {{underwent}} extensive refits {{near the}} end or after the war. North Carolina received a secondary air search set (SR) and a SCR-720 zenith search radar on the forward funnel. At {{the end of the}} war, it had an SP surface-search, a SK-2 air-search, <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 38 main battery fire control system with Mark 13 and 27 radars, <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 37 secondary battery fire control system with Mark 12, 22 and 32 radars, and <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 57 smaller weaponry fire control system, with <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 34 radar. In March 1946, Washington had a SK fore and a SR aft, a SG both fore and aft, and a TDY jammer (which could scramble radar on other ships).|$|E

5|$|Both North Carolina and Washington, {{designed}} {{prior to}} radar, were originally fitted with many fire-control and navigational optical range-finders. The former lasted until 1944, {{when it was}} replaced by <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 27 microwave radar—though it was supplemented by <b>a</b> <b>Mark</b> 3 main armament fire control radar. The range-finders were removed in favor of additional 20mm guns sometime {{between the end of}} 1941 and mid-1942. In addition, the ships were commissioned with two Mark 38 directors and were originally fitted with a CXAM air search, two Mark 3s and three Mark 4 secondary armament.|$|E
