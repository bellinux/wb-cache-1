40|$|Responses of area- 17 neurons {{to light}} <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars moving {{over a wide}} range of speeds were {{measured}} over a range of receptive-field locations in anesthetized and paralyzed cats. For both light bars <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars, velocity sensitivity shifted to higher speeds with increasing eccentricity, whereas response strength and direction selectivity hardly changed. The good correlation between response strength and velocity sensitivity for light <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars suggests that ON and OFF inputs converge upon most area- 17 cells. The correlation between direction selectivities for light <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars was not better than that between velocity sensitivities for light <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars. Only cells with strong direction selectivity were equally direction selective for light bars <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> bars. Comparison with previous studies done with high-contrast stimuli shows that the shift in sensitivity to higher speeds with increasing eccentricity is contrast dependent. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The fur, {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown to gray on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and {{yellowish}} brown on the sides. The underparts are sharply different in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, {{so that the}} fur appears grayish white. The fur is shorter <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> than in T.talamancae and softer and thicker than in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis of}} their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E
40|$|Radiochemical and {{instrumental}} neutron activation analyses of REEs {{and other elements}} have been conducted for Abee clast samples, a matrix sample, a <b>dark</b> inclusion, magnetic <b>and</b> nonmagnetic samples, and bulk samples.

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> than the common impala; melanism {{is responsible for}} the black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{congener}} Sutorius australiensis produces somewhat smaller <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> fruitbodies than S.eximius. The violet-grey bolete, Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus, {{is found}} in eastern North America and Korea. This species is somewhat similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its smoother stipe, less brownish colors, and bitter taste. The Asian and North American black velvet bolete,T.alboater, has a black to grayish-brown cap and grows in deciduous woods. T.violatinctus, found in eastern North America, has whitish pores, a smooth stipe, and a somewhat paler cap than S.eximius.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> upperparts are {{an example}} of countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E

The wings are relatively large <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat to hover. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|E

40|$|Bright pulses <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> solitons coexisting <b>and</b> {{evolving}} in a {{fiber laser}} with strong normal dispersion have been observed. Experimental {{results show that}} there exists a transitional pulse regime with the pulse duty cycle of similar to 0. 5 that connects the bright pulse <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> soliton regimes. On adjusting polarization states and pump power, the duty cycle of pulses varies so that the laser emits bright, transitional, <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> pulses alternately. It is found that dark solitons are composed of two antiphase square pulses with very large durations and duty cycles. The experimental observations reveal that the bright <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> solitons are not completely isolated from each other. This work could provide a new perspective {{to the understanding of}} bright <b>and</b> <b>dark</b> soliton formations as well as their transformations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> gills with white edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, {{though there is}} only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in eastern Cape York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger <b>and</b> <b>darker</b> brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E
