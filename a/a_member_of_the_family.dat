5|$|Lavanify is a {{mammalian}} genus {{from the}} late Cretaceous (probably Maastrichtian, about 71 to 66 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species, L.miolaka, is known from two isolated teeth, {{one of which is}} damaged. The teeth were collected in 1995–1996 and described in 1997. The animal is classified as a member of Gondwanatheria, an enigmatic extinct group with unclear phylogenetic relationships, and within Gondwanatheria as <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Sudamericidae. Lavanify is most closely related to the Indian Bharattherium; the South American Sudamerica and Gondwanatherium are more distantly related. Gondwanatheres probably ate hard plant material.|$|E

5|$|Unicorn is <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Oonopidae (oonopids, or goblin spiders), which {{contains}} over 1,500 species worldwide. Within oonopids, Unicorn is {{classified in the}} subfamily Sulsulinae, {{which contains}} other soft-bodied genera such as Xiombarg and Dalmasula. Due to certain features of the eyes and jaws that resemble those found in other families, and which are differently modified in many other oonopids, Platnick and Brescovit suggested Unicorn {{was among the most}} primitive or basal members of the Oonopidae, which was corroborated by a 2014 study that examined DNA similarities among the Oonopidae, finding that Unicorn and other sulsulines diverged before almost all other oonopids.|$|E
5|$|A few Gabrades also {{remained}} in the Pontus, where they entered {{the service of the}} Empire of Trebizond, established by the exiled Komnenoi shortly before the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204: most notably, <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> was governor of Sinope during the brief period when it was reclaimed from the Turks by Trebizond (ca. 1254 or 1258/9 – 1265 or 1267/8).

5|$|Ankylosaurus is <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Ankylosauridae, and {{its closest}} {{relatives}} {{appear to be}} Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus {{is thought to have}} been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may {{have played a role in}} vocalization. The tail club is thought to have been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears to have been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear to have overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
