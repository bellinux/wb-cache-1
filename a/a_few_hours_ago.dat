60|$|Wilhelmina smiled. Something {{of the joy}} of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> came faintly back to her.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} lit with humour. To have spoken lightly {{on such a}} subject <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> would have seemed incredible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{how about}} it? Do you grasp the psychology? Does it make sense? Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> {{he was engaged}} to Miss Bassett." ...|$|E

60|$|Men {{took their}} destiny {{in their own}} hands and laughed at Fate and at the links of the chain which she had been forging so {{carefully}} and so patiently ever since she began the business {{on the steps of}} the Stadhuis <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] he repeated, {{and then}} he laughed. [...] "You are not, Jane; and if you {{will return to the}} city of Opar and ask them who dwell there they will tell you that I was not dead <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> No, dear, we are both very much alive." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Ray {{moved forward}} and placed {{deliberately}} upon the table {{the roll of}} papers which I had given up to him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is the man}} {{who looked}} in at the window that night," [...] he whispered. [...] "I saw him--only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> It is the same man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day,--only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> I {{was telling}} him where you lived when your uncle came along for the tobacco. They talked a while together, and then went off." ...|$|E
60|$|Colonel Harris, sitting {{near his}} daughter, {{would have given}} worlds {{to know what she}} thought. He himself {{did not know what to}} think. His simple, unsophisticated mind was in a maze. The {{question}} of Luke's possible guilt had suddenly loomed up before him, dissipating the former blind impulse of partisanship and loyalty. Mr. Dobson too looked puzzled, the old family solicitor who had seen Luke and his brothers and sister grow up, who <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> nay minutes, <b>ago</b> would have sworn to his client's innocence before the entire world, he too now was face to face with a hideous feeling of doubt.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Gamp {{went home}} to the bird-fancier's, and was knocked up again that very night for a birth of twins; Mr Mould dined gayly in the bosom of his family, and passed the evening facetiously at his club; the hearse, after {{standing}} {{for a long time}} at the door of a roistering public-house, repaired to its stables with the feathers inside and twelve red-nosed undertakers on the roof, each holding on by a dingy peg, to which, in times of state, a waving plume was fitted; the various trappings of sorrow were carefully laid by in presses for the next hirer; the fiery steeds were quenched and quiet in their stalls; the doctor got merry with wine at a wedding-dinner, and forgot the middle of the story which had no end to it; the pageant of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> short <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> was written nowhere half so legibly as in the undertaker's books.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday we ran {{round to}} the new harbour [of Alexandria], landed the [...] shore-end of the cable close to Cleopatra's bath, and made a very [...] {{satisfactory}} start about one in the afternoon. We had scarcely gone [...] 200 yards when I noticed that the cable ceased to run out, and I [...] wondered why the ship had stopped. People ran aft to tell me not to [...] put such a strain on the cable; I answered indignantly that there was [...] no strain; and suddenly it broke on every one in the ship at once that [...] we were aground. Here was a nice mess. A violent scirocco blew from [...] the land; making one's skin feel as if it belonged to some one else [...] and didn't fit, making the horizon dim and yellow with fine sand, [...] oppressing every sense and raising the thermometer 20 degrees in an [...] hour, but making calm water round us, which enabled the ship to lie [...] for the time in safety. The wind might change at any moment, since the [...] scirocco was only accidental; and at the first wave from seaward bump [...] would go the poor ship, and there would [might] be an end of our [...] voyage. The captain, without waiting to sound, began {{to make an effort}} [...] to put the ship over {{what was supposed to be}} a sandbank; but by the [...] time soundings were made this was found to be impossible, and he had [...] only been jamming the poor Elba faster on a rock. Now every effort [...] was made to get her astern, an anchor taken out, a rope brought to a [...] winch I had for the cable, and the engines backed; but all in vain. A [...] small Turkish Government steamer, which is to be our consort, came to [...] our assistance, but of course very slowly, and much time was occupied [...] before we could get a hawser to her. I could do no good after having [...] made a chart of the soundings round the ship, and went at last on to [...] the bridge to sketch the scene. But at that moment the strain from the [...] winch and a jerk from the Turkish steamer got off the boat, after we [...] had been some hours aground. The carpenter reported that she had made [...] only two inches of water in one compartment; the cable was still [...] uninjured astern, and our spirits rose; when--will you believe [...] it?--after going a short distance astern, the pilot ran us once more [...] fast aground on what seemed to me nearly the same spot. The very same [...] scene was gone through as on the first occasion, and dark came on [...] whilst the wind shifted, and we were still aground. Dinner was served [...] up, but poor Mr. Liddell could eat very little; and bump, bump, grind, [...] grind, went the ship fifteen or sixteen times as we sat at dinner. The [...] slight sea, however, did enable us to bump off. This morning we appear [...] not to have suffered in any way; but a sea is rolling in, which <b>a</b> <b>few</b> [...] <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> would have settled the poor old Elba.|$|R
60|$|Ann, however, {{produced}} it--which, {{considering that}} Mr. Bullsom had carefully placed it there <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> was not extraordinary--and Brooks sipped the wine with inward tremors, {{justified by the}} result.|$|E
60|$|Excitement {{seemed to}} have steadied my nerves. I forgot all the minor tragedies which had been real enough things to face only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> I spoke calmly and decisively.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think so," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "We had {{the pleasure}} of knocking them both down <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> As it was a private affair, we won't go into details." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only met}} you this afternoon--a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago.</b> And here we are, {{absolutely}} wedged together on these seats--and my chaperon is dozing half the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] Julian began, [...] "a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> {{you came}} to a momentous decision. You are all at work, {{prepared}} to carry that decision into effect. I {{have come to see}} you because I am very much afraid that we have been the victims of false statements, the victims of a disgraceful plot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Mannering," [...] Lord Redford said, {{tapping the}} {{outspread}} evening paper with his forefinger, [...] "the situation now presents a different aspect. I have {{no wish to}} force your hand--a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I think I proved this. But if you are to remain even nominally with us some sort of pronouncement must come from you in reply to these statements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he said, [...] "God {{is against}} me! And yet <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I dared {{to think that}} He had guided me to a haven of rest and forgetfulness! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your husband already knows, madame," [...] was {{the quiet}} reply. [...] "Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I proved to him whence had come the leakage {{of so many}} of our secrets lately." ...|$|E
60|$|Louise sighed,--she {{was really}} very sleepy. Then, as the {{thoughts}} began to crowd into her brain, she began also to remember. Some part of the excitement of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> returned.|$|E
60|$|Everything {{was just}} as it had been those <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> when last he had picked up his broad-brimmed hat from the table {{and walked out of the}} cottage into the night. Everything was the same as it had been when his young girl-wife pushed a leather wallet across the table to him: the wallet which {{contained}} the fortune that he had not yet dared to turn fully to his own account.|$|R
5000|$|Sailing Plan - {{contains}} complete {{routing information}} {{and should be}} sent within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> before, upon, or within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after departure.|$|R
50|$|In an {{experiment}} with mice, the animals died within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after injection of a lethal dose of micocystin-LR. Liver damage could be noticed in 20 minutes. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> liver cells died.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{probably}} {{found himself}} {{too weak to}} appear in public," [...] replied Flo Stanton. [...] "I'm sure if I had been all but drowned <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I would prefer bed to society." ...|$|E
60|$|Tinville {{remained}} {{one of the}} last; he and Merlin seemed {{suddenly to}} have buried the hatchet, which <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> had threatened to destroy {{one or the other}} of these whilom bosom friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who knows?" [...] {{said the}} man, {{shaking his head}} despondently. [...] "They {{departed}} together <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> in a boat with forty rowers, and they took with them the King and Queen of Pingaree!" ...|$|E
60|$|The New Municipals {{have come}} and gone; with Three Flags, Liberte, Egalite, Patrie, and the clang of vivats. Vergniaud, he who as President <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> talked of Dying for Constituted Authorities, has moved, as Committee-Reporter, that the Hereditary Representative be suspended; that a NATIONAL CONVENTION do {{forthwith}} assemble to say what further! An able Report: which the President must have had ready in his pocket? A President, in such cases, must have much ready, and yet not ready; and Janus-like look before and after.|$|R
6000|$|... "Letty," [...] Macheson said, [...] "a <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> Miss Thorpe-Hatton offered Stephen Hurd a dowry for you of a {{thousand}} pounds, if he would promise to bring you back as his wife. He refused. He has not the slightest intention of making you his wife. I am sorry to have to speak so plainly, but you see we haven't much time for beating about the bush, have we? I {{want you to come}} with me to Berkeley Square. Mrs. Brown will look after you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God spares {{the lives}} of His {{servants}} to His own time," [...] said the peddler, solemnly. [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago</b> I was your prisoner, and threatened with the gallows; now you are mine; but, Major Dunwoodie, you are free. There are men abroad who would treat you less kindly. Of what service would that sword be to you against my weapon and a steady hand? Take the advice of one who has never harmed you, and who never will. Do not trust yourself in the skirts of any wood, unless in company and mounted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} Lenora, Mr. Ashleigh," [...] he remarked. [...] "However, if it {{interests}} you, I will tell you why I know she has been abducted. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> I was talking to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{well did}} Peter know the sound; [...] The {{language}} of those drunken joys [...] To him, a jovial soul, I ween, [...] But <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> had been [...] A gladsome and a welcome noise. [...] 880 ...|$|E
6000|$|Benita {{shook her}} head. [...] "He was alive <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>ago,</b> for I {{could hear him}} raving and {{shouting}} outside the wall we built. But, father, it has all come back to me; I believe that I have found it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Contextual {{inquiry is}} resource-intensive. It {{requires}} {{travel to the}} informant's site, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> with each user, and then <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more <b>hours</b> {{to interpret the results}} of the interview.|$|R
