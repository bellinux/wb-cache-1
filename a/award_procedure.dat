Issues such as the allocation mechanisms (to be) used for granting those concessions, {{the determination of the}} concession term and concession fees, as well as the inclusion of special clauses aimed at assuring that the terminal operator will act {{in the interest of the}} port authority and the wider community, are increasingly relevant to both academics and the port industry. So far, insights from established economic theories have rarely been applied to terminal concessions in seaports.

It also introduced a new <b>award</b> <b>procedure,</b> the Design Contest. But its scope excluded several specific services, as well as service concessions, which may have been due to certain national constitutional restrictions against the outsourcing of public services.

40|$|The term public {{procurement}} {{refers to a}} contract between public entity and private companies. The {{public procurement}} contracts are regulated by the Public Procurement Act, which specifies the rules under which the public procurement should be performed and sets conditions of award procedures of public contracts. The quality of execution of the <b>award</b> <b>procedure</b> influences the efficiency and the transparency of the contract. The <b>award</b> <b>procedure</b> can be executed by internal employees of the contractor or outsourced. The main aim of this thesis is to analyze whether the contractors behave rationally when they outsource the award procedure; this thesis evaluates the differences between an in-house administration and an outsourced administration in prices, efficiency in terms of number of bidders in the contract and probability of formal errors in the <b>award</b> <b>procedure.</b> The results of the analysis shows that small contractors behave rationally; when they administrate the <b>award</b> <b>procedure</b> in-house they tend to make more formal errors thus they outsource the procedure. On the other hand, the large contractors do not behave rationally, because they outsource the administration of <b>award</b> <b>procedure</b> even if all three indicators show that they administrate the procedure in-house more successfully.

If cost differences are more pronounced for more complex designs, it is optimal to fix a simple design ex ante and to renegotiate to a more complex and costlier design ex post.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relative}} efficiency of auctions and negotiations {{is still a}} puzzle in the literature. While auctions are the prescribed procedures and the most used ones for public procurement, in the private sector, where buyers are free to choose their purchasing method, competitive tendering {{is far from being}} their preferred option (Bajari et al. 2009). In addition, recent empirical studies (Estache et al. 2009, Bajari et al. 2009) highlight some failures of auction procedures and identify conditions under which negotiation is more efficient. In particular, they show that auctions perform poorly when projects are complex. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to this debate by providing an empirical analysis of how awarding mechanisms are chosen in public procurement in France. To this end, we examine a comprehensive database of 76, 188 observations corresponding to the entire set of public procurement work contracts awarded between 2005 and 2007 in the construction sector. We find empirical regularities regarding the choice of <b>awarding</b> <b>procedures</b> by public buyers. However, most of these regularities do not coincide with what the theoretical literature considers as transaction-cost minimizing behaviours. In particular, the size of the construction projects as well as the length of contracts do not appear as key determinants of the choice of <b>awarding</b> <b>procedures,</b> which translates into costly renegotiations...|$|R

40|$|Members of Congress {{frequently}} receive {{requests from}} constituents {{for information and}} assistance in obtaining funds for projects.

A congressional office may on occasion choose to communicate with selected audiences by targeted mailings or sponsoring seminars on federal and private assistance. One way an office can help is in counseling on proposal writing, which includes demonstrating the need for the proposed project, what methods to be used to accomplish these objectives, the means by which the project will be monitored and evaluated, plans for continuing the project beyond the period covered by the grant, and a detailed budget. If a proposal or serious inquiry is submitted to a congressional office, an assessment of the stated problem should be made.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of transparency and openness to competition in public procurement in the Czech Republic. The problems of the Czech procurement market have been demonstrated on the analysis of a sample of contracts awarded by local government entities. From among a set of factors influencing the efficiency of public procurement, we closely analyse transparency, resilience against corruption, openness, effective administrative <b>award</b> <b>procedure,</b> and formulation of appropriate evaluation criteria for selecting the most suitable bid. Some assumptions were confirmed, including a positive effect of open procedures {{on the level of}} competition on the supply side as well as the dominant use of price criteria only. The latter case is probably often caused by low skills of workers at the contracting entities, as well as the lack of resources in public budgets. However, we have to reject the persistent legend of “undershooting” tender prices and subsequently increasing the final prices of public contracts. Increases of final prices are very limited. Based on the results of the analyses presented, we argue that the main problem of the Czech public procurement market lies in a rather low competence of administrators who are not able to use non-price criteria more often...|$|E
