30|$|The vapour-sensing {{properties}} of PPy–ZrP with <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapours</b> {{can be explained}} by the interaction of ammonia with PPy in the PPy–ZrP nanocomposite and is almost a reversible process, although a little bit of irreversibility is observed. Under ambient conditions, the value of resistivity increased due to the interaction of lone pair electron of ammonia with the positive charge of PPy in PPy–TSP. The mobility of charge carriers decreases which leads to an increase in resistivity. The interaction between lone pair of ammonia and positive charge of polarons or bipolarons of PPy in PPy–ZRP is electrostatic because it occurs between two opposite charges. Due to the small magnitude of charge, this interaction is weak in nature so it becomes reversible when it comes in contact with air, thus resistivity is restored. The resistivity did not come back to its original value and was always found higher than the previous value for higher concentration of ammonia. Hence, it can be concluded that there are two processes in operation: first, reversible chemisorption of ammonia with PPy occurs and second, compensation or electrical neutralization of the polymer backbone takes place.|$|R

The processed aerosol's heterogeneous ice nucleation properties were determined in both the water subsaturated and supersaturated humidity regimes at − 30 °C and − 25 °C using Colorado State University's continuous flow diffusion chamber. The amount of sulphuric acid coating material was estimated by an aerosol mass spectrometer and from CCN-derived hygroscopicity measurements. The condensation of sulphuric acid decreased the dust particles' ice nucleation ability {{in proportion to the}} amount of sulphuric acid added. Heating the coated particles in a thermodenuder at 250 °C – intended to evaporate the sulphuric acid coating – reduced their freezing ability even further. We attribute this behaviour to accelerated acid digestion of ice active surface sites by heat. Exposing sulphuric acid coated dust to ammonia gas produced particles with similarly poor freezing potential; however a portion of their ice nucleation ability could be restored after heating in the thermodenuder. In no case did any combination of thermochemical treatments increase the ice nucleation ability of the coated mineral dust particles compared to unprocessed dust. These first measurements of the effect of identical chemical processing of dust particles on their ice nucleation ability in both water subsaturated and mixed-phase supersaturated cloud conditions revealed that ice nucleation was more sensitive to all coating treatments in the water subsaturated regime. The results clearly indicate irreversible impairment of ice nucleation activity in both regimes after condensation of concentrated sulphuric acid. This implies that the sulphuric acid coating caused permanent chemical and/or physical modification of the ice active surface sites; the possible dissolution of the coating during droplet activation did not restore all immersion/condensation-freezing ability...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{aim of this}} project {{was to develop a}} sensor capable of detecting mercury in gaseous flow in alumina refineries for a concentration range from 1 to 10 mg/m 3 at temperatures of 20 - 80 °C. The objectives were set to monitor the mercury in an industrial environment. Quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) with gold films were investigated and utilized in mercury sensing. When mercury amalgamates with thin gold film it changes the frequency of the device and the rate of the frequency change corresponds to the mercury concentration. The researcher’s goal was to improve the device sensitivity via gold film surface modification. In a QCM, the sensing mechanism is predominantly surface-dominated. Surface features of small grain size, large aspect ratio and, high porosity are required to realize a highly sensitive QCM. Gold covered nano-features on the surface of QCM electrodes were employed for increasing the surface to volume ratio of the device to enhance its sensitivity. Three different methods were employed for the formation of nanostructured films which were covered with gold to form the mercury sensing layers. Nanofeatured thin films were successfully fabricated on the QCM electrode surfaces using thermal evaporation, anodization and nanocarving processes. These processes were chosen as they were compatible with QCM standards and the rigid structure of QCM allowed and facilitates such surface manipulations. Thermal evaporation was used for the deposition of nanostructured molybdenum oxide (MoO 3). These nanostructures comprised of hexagonal nanoplatelets with the majority of the side dimensions of less than 250 nm and thicknessed of less than 20 nm. Anodization process was used on QCMs’ titanium films electrodes. The nanopores of diameters in the range of 10 - 20 nm, pores length of 300 - 600 nm and inter-gaps in the order of 20 - 40 nm were obtained. Nanocarving process was used for carving the titanium thin films with H 2 at elevated temperatures. Nano-rods of diameters 20 - 150 nm, lengths of up to 600 nm, and spacing in the range of 70 - 150 nm were observed. The author employed an extensive range of characterisation equipment to understand films’ properties. In addition, different techniques were employed to correlate the gas sensing behavior to the films’ micro/nano characteristics. These analysis techniques include Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) which allowed visual analysis of the morphology of the thin films. Crystallization and grain structures were inspected by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis, crystallite phases were determined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, surface area of a material was assessed by Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analysis and determination of the presence of metals was carried out by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis. A computer controlled 4 -channel gas calibration system was designed and developed to calibrate and test the sensors towards mercury, humidity and <b>ammonia</b> <b>vapours.</b> Compared to non-modified QCMs, the thermally evaporated nanostructures (MoO 3) and anodized nonporous films (TiO 2) showed larger sensitivities towards mercury vapours which were attributed to the large surface to volume ratio of these structures.
