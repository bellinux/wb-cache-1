40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of IEA SHC Task 42 / ECES Annex 29, a simple tool for the economic evaluation of thermal energy storages has been developed and tested on various existing storages. On that account, the storage capacity costs (costs per installed storage capacity) of thermal energy storages have been evaluated via a Top-down and a Bottom-up approach. The Top-down approach follows {{the assumption that the}} costs of energy supplied by the storage should not exceed the costs of energy from the market. The maximum acceptable storage capacity costs depend on the interest rate assigned to the capital costs, the intended payback period of the user class (e. g. industry or building), the reference energy costs, and the <b>annual</b> number of <b>storage</b> cycles. The Bottom-up approach focuses on the realised storage capacity costs of existing storages. The economic evaluation via Top-down and Bottom-up approach is a valuable tool to make a rough estimate of the economic viability of an energy storage for a specific application. An important finding is that the <b>annual</b> number of <b>storage</b> cycles has the largest influence on the cost effectiveness. At present and with respect to the investigated storages, seasonal heat storage is only economical via large sensible hot water storages. Contrary, if the <b>annual</b> number of <b>storage</b> cycles is sufficiently high, all thermal energy storage technologies can become competitive...|$|R
40|$|The interannual {{variability}} in upper-ocean (0 – 400 m) temperature and governing mechanisms {{for the period}} 1968 – 97 are quantified from a global ocean hindcast simulation driven by atmospheric reanalysis and satellite data products. The unconstrained simulation exhibits considerable skill in replicating the observed interannual {{variability in}} vertically integrated heat content estimated from hydrographic data and monthly satellite sea surface temperature and sea surface height data. Globally, the most significant interannual variability modes arise from El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean zonal mode, with sub-stantial extension beyond the Tropics into the midlatitudes. In the well-stratified Tropics and subtropics, net <b>annual</b> heat <b>storage</b> variability is driven predominately by the convergence of the advective heat transport, mostly reflecting velocity anomalies times the mean temperature field. Vertical velocity variability is caused by remote wind forcing, and subsurface temperature anomalies are governed mostly by isopycnal displace-ments (heave). The dynamics at mid- to high latitudes are qualitatively different and vary regionally. Interannual temperature variability is more coherent with depth because of deep winter mixing and varia-tions in western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current that span the upper thermocline. Net <b>annual</b> heat <b>storage</b> variability is forced by a mixture of local air–sea heat fluxes and the convergence of the advective heat transport, the latter resulting from both velocity and temperature anomalies. Also, density-compensated temperature changes on isopycnal surfaces (spice) are quantitatively significant. 1...|$|R
