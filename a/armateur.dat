40|$|This paper {{examines}} la traite negriere {{in terms}} of investment behaviour and investment returns. The research focus is the investments of one <b>armateur,</b> Francois Deguer, a diversified market player in eighteenth-century France. The results provide additional evidence, in an accounting context, of the trade's profitability, either as a stand-alone business or {{in conjunction with other}} parts of maritime commerce. Specifically, the analysis indicates that slave-trade investments held the possibility of above-average returns compared with other available investment opportunities. This result reinforces the arguments of Daudin (2002 a, 2002 b, 2004) who proposed the analysis of slave-trade investments {{in terms of}} risk, return, liquidity and time frame. Daudin's work examines limitations of the profit calculations used in prior historical research and offers alternatives that are theoretically sound and pragmatically possible. While the results in this study are based on a case analysis, they demonstrate how the informed use of archival sources can contribute to the findings from more generalised, cross-sectional studies. As historians of the slave trade have noted, each trading voyage was unique, described as a lottery, but one which could offer potentially significant returns. Lessons can be drawn from these initial results, as we confront accounting's implication in contemporary trading practices.

40|$|Additive manufacturing, more {{specifically}} 3 D printing using fused filament fabrication (FFF), {{is a valuable}} technique; however, little {{has been done in}} developing a new mechanism for driving filament through the hot end of the 3 D printer. This investigation focuses on a prototype extruder mechanism that utilizes two counter rotating motors to force filament through the nozzle. The plastic passes through the <b>armateurs</b> of the two motors and the oppositely-threaded shafts drive the filament while balancing each others torque. This design provides better protection against jamming of the nozzle. A bench top prototype was able to extrude filament at a rate much greater than traditional mechanisms allow, but the threads on the aluminum shafts wore down with very little use. An abrasive wear model of the extruder shafts was developed {{in order to determine the}} theoretical lifetime of the shafts given a certain material hardness. The wear rate of the shafts is proportional to the hardness of the material and the square of the velocity of the extruded filament. Based on this model as well as experiments done with various materials, it is estimated that steel shafts will have a lifetime that is 3 to 10 times longer than aluminum shafts. Still, this lifetime is still far too short for a part meant to be used 24 / 7. The wear on the threads of the shafts is so severe that no feasible material could survive an adequate lifetime before failure. by Joseph Sandoval. Thesis: S.

5000|$|Édouard Gruner, mining {{engineer}} and vice-president of the Comité central des houillères, {{was an active}} member of the Société d'économie sociale and secretary-treasurer of the Musée social.He had already introduced Robert Pinot to the metallurgy manufacturers who were looking for a leader for their trade association, and did the same for de Rousiers by putting him in contact with the shipbuilders, who wanted to found a professional association.De Rousiers was engaged in 1903 by André Lebon, former minister of Commerce and then of the Colonies, and first president of the Comité central des <b>armateurs</b> de France (CCAF: Central Committee of French Shipowners).De Rousiers was secretary-general and vice-president-delegate of the committee.He now had stable employment that allowed him to rebuild his family home in Rhus and provide education to his five children.The CCAF was an owners' association typical of the time with the purpose of studying and defending the common interests of the shipowners.Within a year it represented 98% of the industry.De Rousiers quickly established a service to gather French and foreign information, which he described in March 1910, The information service of the Shipowners' Committee is not conceived in an academic spirit but in a spirit of practical use. We do not intend to constitute a compendium of jurisprudence or a compendium of statistics; We strive to point out to you all that seems likely to have an impact on your industry, anything that threatens your general interests, anything that is of a nature to serve them. The information service and a legal section both were frequently consulted by the shipowners.With his considerable intellectual authority, de Rousiers was an effective defender of the interests of the shipowners and contributed to dscussions on legislative project. At times he was criticized for being too effective in his lobbying.During World War I (1914-18) there was an enforced truce between the shipowners and the labor unions, with the state as mediator.As soon as the Armistice was declared the shipowners, led by the Committee, reasserted their independence in negotiating wages.De Rousiers justified this position, Conditions vary according to the region; Working conditions vary according to traffic and categories of vessels. Remuneration also depends on the possibilities of each company. How could it be conceived that, in the midst of a crisis, a professional trade union would be forced, by submitting to such an arbitration procedure, to impose new burdens on all its members which might exceed the limit of what some can bear? It would be a lack of clairvoyance.|$|R
