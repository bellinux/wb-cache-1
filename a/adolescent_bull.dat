Young Walshingham, {{the girl}} with the freckles, Coote and Mrs. Walshingham, were playing up to him in the most benevolent way, and between the landing place and Lympne, Fortune, to crown their efforts, had placed a small, convenient field entirely at the disposal of an <b>adolescent</b> <b>bull.</b> Not a big, real, resolute bull, but, on the other hand, no calf; a young bull, in the same stage of emotional development as Kipps, [...] "standing where the two rivers meet."

A hierarchical regression analysis showed that, when partialing for the influence of reading ability, age, and gender, mathematical computation was better predicted by verbal than by visual-spatial working memory. Fur-thermore, the results showed that the {{relationship between}} mathematics ability and working memory were not significantly moderated by age but were stable across a broad age span. We concluded that, regardless of age, deficits in mathematics are mediated by both a domain-general and a domain-specific working memory system. his study focuses on the relation-ship between working memory JL and mathematics ability across a broad age span. Although it is known that working memory functioning im-proves throughout childhood, adoles-cence, and into early adulthood and then declines in older adults (e. g., Demp-ster, 1992; Salthouse, 1995; Verhaeghen & Salthouse, 1997), it is not known whether these same trends occur when mathematics ability is considered (Wi-daman & Little, 1992). Most studies re-lated to mathematics and working memory (WM) have focused on either children and <b>adolescents</b> (e. g., <b>Bull...</b>|$|R
