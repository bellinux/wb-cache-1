25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), when it seems possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Jannai {{taught that}} when Moses {{learned that he}} was to die on that day, he wrote 13 scrolls of the law — 12 for the 12 tribes, and one which he placed in the Ark — so that if <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> seek to forge {{anything}} in a scroll, they could refer back to the scroll in the Ark. Moses thought that he could busy himself with the Torah — the whole of which is life — and then the sun would set and the decree for his death would lapse. God signaled to the sun, but the sun refused to obey God, saying that it would not set and leave Moses alive in the world.|$|E

I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset.

25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

[...] A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a [...] "trivialization", instead describing it as [...] "a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment". Wickman concluded, [...] "If there's anything <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> know by now about Beyoncé Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self-presentation that isn't carefully chosen." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{recited the}} stated {{purpose of the}} coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, then noted that the obverse {{depicted}} Stephen Foster, the composer and songwriter—who died in 1864, whereas Cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873. [...] "The Commission is {{at a loss to}} connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873." [...] Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore admitted, but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper, and his main contributions to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to commemorate Cincinnati's contributions to the art of music, and Foster [...] "was an American troubadour, but to music as an art he made no contribution". Moore felt that if <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> be depicted, it should be Theodore Thomas, who conducted the Cincinnati May Festival from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of the Cincinnati College of Music. He stated that [...] "Theodore Thomas was, artistically, the founder of Cincinnati as a musical center. His portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of Cincinnati 'as a center of music'".|$|E

It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act."

[...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say <b>anyone</b> <b>should</b> be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E

His rise to fame has been used as [...] "a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas, courage, and, of course, a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society." [...] Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to be an important reason for PewDiePie's popularity. In 2015, PewDiePie was included on Time's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, cementing his influence as an internet personality. Later in 2015, PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Varietys [...] "Famechangers" [...] issue, with the magazine ranking him as the [...] "#1 Famechanger", or [...] "those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest".
