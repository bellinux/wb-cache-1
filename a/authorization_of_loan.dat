40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "From fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2012, the U. S. Export-Import Bank's (Ex-Im) outstanding financial commitments (exposure) grew from about $ 59 billion to about $ 107 billion, largely in long-term loans and guarantees. Factors associated with this growth include reduced private-sector financing following the financial crisis and Ex-Im's <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>loans</b> [...] a product not offered by export credit agencies in some other countries [...] {{to fill the gap}} in private-sector lending. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1972, he {{was elected}} Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico for a {{four-year}} term. In the U.S. House of Representatives {{he was assigned to}} the Committee on Education and Labor, an important committee assignment for a man who cared deeply about education and who had an interest in social and labor conditions in Puerto Rico. In the 94th Congress, Benítez introduced legislation to extend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to Puerto Rico. He showed interest in the affairs of U.S. territories, sponsoring legislation to allow American Samoa to elect a governor and lieutenant governor, and supporting the <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> a <b>loan</b> to the Virgin Islands Government.|$|R
40|$|Moral hazard lending at the Certified Development Company (CDC) level {{involves}} the origination or <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to businesses in riskier industries through risk free funds {{provided by the}} sale of SBA agency debentures. This study analyzes the performance and lending behavior of CDCs between 2001 and 2007 {{to determine if they}} engaged in moral hazard lending. Of particular interest is the determination of changes in lending behavior after competitive restrictions on CDCs were eliminated on November 11, 2003 (SBA 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal year 2004), and a comparison of lending behaviors between the different sizes of CDCs. It should be noted that there is no existing literature on this subject, and this paper begins the debate on the market structure of the CDC industry. Because of this fact, banking literature that explores moral hazard lending was used to develop justification and guidelines for the empirical research. This study analyzes loan losses by NAICS industry code to determine which industry sectors pose the greatest risk and then compares these results to the existing and proposed <b>loan</b> portfolios <b>of</b> CDCs to determine if certain groups of CDCs engage in riskier lending practices. Based on management reports provided by the SBA for the operations of CDCs at five different size levels (tiers), and data on loan authorizations for proposed future loans, the results indicate a significant difference in lending behavior that {{can be attributed to the}} size of the CDC. Smaller CDCs have a significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> to industry sectors with historically higher loan losses. Moreover, these smaller CDCs have higher actual losses and loan delinquencies, and their future loan portfolios as determined by new loan authorizations are skewed toward businesses in riskier industry sectors. As such, this study finds that smaller CDCs are engaging in moral hazard lending. While the study did not reveal a change in lending behavior after competitive restrictions on CDCs were eliminated in 2004, future results may change when data from additional years is obtained and analyzed...|$|R
5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's <b>authorization</b> <b>of</b> a $535million <b>loan</b> guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|R
