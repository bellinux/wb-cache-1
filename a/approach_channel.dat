25|$|Goethals {{divided the}} {{engineering}} and excavation work into three divisions: Atlantic, Central, and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, {{was responsible for}} construction of the massive breakwater {{at the entrance to}} Limon Bay, the Gatun locks and their 3½ mi (5.6 km) <b>approach</b> <b>channel,</b> and the immense Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division, under Sydney B. Williamson (the only civilian member of this high-level team), was similarly responsible for the Pacific 3 mi (4.8 km) breakwater in Panama Bay, the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to the locks, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams and reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to {{the port}} is 3,775m long. The minimum depth of the {{entrance}} channel is 16m below chart datum (BCD) and the minimum width is 250m. The turning basin is 600m in diameter with a minimum depth of 15.5m BCD. The breakwaters in the port are of rubble-mound type with accropode armour protection. The northern breakwater measures 3,080m and the southern breakwater measures 1,070m.|$|E
25|$|With the {{acquisition}} of about 440 hectares of land, {{the first phase of}} the port consisted of the construction of a coal jetty, a wharf and an entrance channel and related dredging operations. The main construction work included two berths for handling coal vessels up to 65,000 DWT, dredging for the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> and harbour basin, onshore civil works, navigational aids, and two breakwaters—4km in the north side and 1km in the south—close to the NCTPS and the Ennore Creek. In 2014, the port was officially renamed as Kamarajar Port.|$|E

50|$|The first {{excavations}} {{for the new}} <b>approach</b> <b>channels</b> at Miraflores {{began on}} July 1, 1940, following the passage by Congress of an appropriations bill on June 24, 1940. The first dry excavation at Gatún began on February 19, 1941. Considerable material was excavated before the project was abandoned, and the <b>approach</b> <b>channels</b> can still be seen paralleling the original channels at Gatún and Miraflores.|$|R

25|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to {{the port}} has two sections—the {{entrance}} channel within the protection of outer arm and the outer channel beyond the protection of outer arm. The total length of the entrance channel is 7km. The width of channel gradually increased from 244m to 419m at the bent portion, then maintains a constant width of 305m. The depth of the inner and the outer channels are 18.6m and 19.2m, respectively, below chart datum, with a swell allowances of 3m. The entrance is 350m in Bharathi Dock and 125m in Dr. Ambedkar Dock. The draught in the navigational channel is maintained by dredging approximately 1 million cubic metres annually.|$|E
2500|$|Chennai port is {{the second}} {{smallest}} in the country measured by surface area, encompassing only 274 hectares. Chennai port area is divided into north, central and south zones and fishing harbours.

2500|$|A hasty {{plan was}} made to block Dieppe harbour and on 10 June, [...] (Captain G. A. Garnon-Williams) escorted three blockships to the port. Two were sunk in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> but the third ship hit a mine just outside, which {{prevented}} it being sunk {{at the entrance to}} the inner harbour. (James had signalled that many IX Corps troops would probably be trapped against the sea near St. Valery, where he had assembled flotillas of smaller craft under the local Senior Naval Officer.) Beach parties landed at Le Havre to take control of the evacuation on 10 June and after a 24-hour postponement, the evacuation began on 11 June. The embarkation was hindered somewhat by the damage to the port caused by Luftwaffe bombing; the troopship , was hit and beached, the electric power was also cut, rendering the cranes on the docks useless. Ramps were tried for vehicle loading but it was too slow. On 12 June, RAF fighters began patrolling the port and deterred more raids and an attempt {{was made to}} save the transport and equipment by diverting it over the Seine via the ferry crossings at Caudebec or the ships at Quillebeuf at the river mouth. The quartermaster of the 14th Royal Fusiliers succeeded in getting the transport away.|$|E

50|$|A {{quick look}} at the map will show how Fort Strong's central {{location}} made it so well suited for harbor defense.
