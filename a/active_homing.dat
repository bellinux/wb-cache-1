50|$|<b>Active</b> radar <b>homing</b> (ARH) is {{a missile}} {{guidance}} method {{in which a}} missile contains a radar transceiver (in contrast to Semi-active radar homing, which uses only a receiver) and the electronics necessary for it to find and track its target autonomously.

50|$|The maneuverable {{reentry vehicle}} (abbreviated MARV or MaRV) {{is a type}} of {{ballistic}} missile whose warhead is capable of autonomous tracking ground targets. It often requires some terminal <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> guidance (like Pershing II active radar homing) to make sure the missile does not miss the target, because of the frequent trajectory shifts. Refer to atmospheric reentry.|$|E

50|$|The Phoenix {{has several}} {{guidance}} modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between 80000 ft and 100000 ft {{at close to}} Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around 11 mi from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around 2 nmi km and <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> would initiate upon launch.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Active</b> <b>homing</b> uses a {{radar system}} on the missile to provide a {{guidance}} signal. Typically electronics in the missile keep the radar pointed directly at the target, and the missile then looks at this [...] "angle" [...] of its own centerline to guide itself. Radar resolution {{is based on the}} size of the antenna, so in a smaller missile these systems are useful for attacking only large targets, ships or large bombers for instance. Active radar systems remain in widespread use in anti-shipping missiles, and in [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] air-to-air missile systems such as AIM-120 AMRAAM and R-77 ...|$|E

5000|$|Air-to-air {{missiles}} are broadly put in two groups. Those designed to engage opposing aircraft at ranges {{of less than}} 30 km are known as short-range or [...] "within visual range" [...] missiles (SRAAMs or WVRAAMs) and are sometimes called [...] "dogfight" [...] missiles because {{they are designed to}} optimize their agility rather than range. Most use infrared guidance and are called heat-seeking missiles. In contrast, medium- or long-range missiles (MRAAMs or LRAAMs), which both fall under the category of beyond visual range missiles (BVRAAMs), tend to rely upon radar guidance, of which there are many forms. Some modern ones use inertial guidance and/or [...] "mid-course updates" [...] to get the missile close enough to use an <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> sensor.|$|E
50|$|While Electrona risso can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the world, widespread in the Indian, Pacific, Atlantic Oceans, and Mediterranean, the other four species are limited to the southern hemisphere, mostly limited to the Southern Ocean. Their dispersion {{is dependent on the}} balance between current-mediated larval dispersal and adult <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> behavior. Besides E. rissoi is E. paucirastra the only species that is found north of the Southern Ocean.E. antarctica mainly inhabits the Antarctic deep and therefore warmer waters. E. carlsbergii inhabits the water south of the Antarctica convergence to the Antarctic coast, and between the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic convergences. Larval forms of many deep-water species are found to inhabit inshore waters. Migration patterns vary between different species, size groups, life history stages, sex, latitude, time and season.|$|E
5000|$|At the DSEi {{conference in}} September 2007 it was {{announced}} the UK MoD was funding a study by MBDA to investigate a replacement for the Rapier and Sea Wolf missiles. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) would share components with ASRAAM. [...] Common components include the very low signature rocket motor from Roxel, the warhead and proximity fuse from Thales. The Common Data Link (CDL) is the small ‘black box’ that sits {{on top of the}} mast, especially clear in pictures of FLAADS(L) although it doesn’t necessarily have to use the two-way data link to the launch vehicle, so, it could take mid-course corrections from any number of suitably equipped land or air platforms and then switch to <b>active</b> <b>homing</b> when it gets close enough. The original launch platform could have even moved by the time the missile hits.|$|E
