5|$|Having not {{yet made}} a {{professional}} appearance for Birmingham, Doyle joined League Two club Chester City on loan in October 2004. Chester's first-choice goalkeeper Wayne Brown was injured <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> cover for reserve Chris Mackenzie. While at Chester, Doyle played his first match in English senior football as Chester defeated Rochdale in the Football League Trophy.|$|E
5|$|By early February {{the program}} coding {{switched}} from legal pads to the PDP-10 and a preliminary version {{was completed by}} March 1975. Gates and Allen had {{been in contact with}} Roberts and MITS and the older looking Paul Allen would travel to Albuquerque in March. MITS needed more time to get a computer with 7k bytes of memory working, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> more time to get the software finished. When Allen arrived at MITS it took a day to get the software running; Allen remembers this being caused by computer memory problems while Roberts remembers the delay was due to software problems.|$|E
5|$|Amos {{was born}} in Macclesfield, Cheshire {{and was a member}} of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was {{released}} at the age of 10. While at Crewe, he also played for another local team, Bollington United, as a centre midfielder. One year later, Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top of the table, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to win the match to win the league. Amos' team's goalkeeper was injured during the game, and as the tallest on the team, Amos was put in goal; however, he had also been the team's regular penalty taker all season, so when they were awarded a penalty, he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick. He scored, and his team went on to win the game 3–2, together with the league title. After the game, his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials. Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11.|$|E

5|$|The script {{remained}} under Columbia's shelf until {{legal issues}} {{forced them to}} withdraw. The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of Double Indemnity entitled Big Trouble. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to Double Indemnity <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> the permission of Universal Pictures, owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With Big Trouble already set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script for Back to the Future during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the Double Indemnity license {{in exchange for the}} rights to Back to the Future. Thus, the film finally had a home at Universal.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} {{had been}} at the centre of many controversies since its inception. BCCI had given the franchise ultimatum to dissolve factionalism and infighting or face scrapping.

25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on just a couple of conditions: They had to do it in four days, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to relocate the shoot from Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{signing of the}} Lakers {{off-season}} was past hero Derek Fisher, signed to a three-year deal worth approximately $14 million. Fisher {{was released from the}} Utah Jazz at his request during the offseason so his family could move to a city that has better treatment for his daughter, who was diagnosed with retinoblastoma. The Lakers signed him in order to add stability at the point <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a player who was well versed in the triangle offense. The Lakers were also hoping that signing a former veteran of the Lakers would ease Bryant's demand to be traded.|$|E
25|$|In Western Han Dynasty, {{elaborate}} and lavish burials were common practice. One reason was {{the notion of}} imperishability of the soul: {{it was believed that}} another world existed for the dead, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> food and accommodation just like the living. Therefore, the consecration for the dead should be the same as what was provided for the living, and all the necessities in life should be brought into the grave for use in the afterlife. The other was the emphasis on filial piety during that time. In Han Dynasty, filial piety had become an important approach to become an official, and {{elaborate and}} lavish burials are a significant way to show filial piety to one's deceased parents. These were among the main reasons why there were so many precious artifacts in Xin Zhui's tomb.|$|E

25|$|The raiders {{never got}} {{far ahead of}} Fuller. Destroying the railway behind the hijacked train was a slow process. The raiders were too few in number and were too poorly {{equipped}} with the proper railway track tools and demolition equipment, or with suitable igniters and explosives to effectively close the line. Also, the raiders had stolen a regularly scheduled train on its route, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to keep to that train's timetable. If they reached a siding ahead of schedule, they had to wait there until scheduled southbound trains passed them before they could continue north. As well, railway officials in Chattanooga had sufficient time to evacuate engines and rolling stock to the south, hauling critical railroad supplies away from the Union threat, so as to prevent their either being captured by General Mitchel or trapped uselessly inside Chattanooga during a Union siege of the city.|$|E
25|$|When they {{initially}} {{captured the}} bridge, the American engineers {{were not sure}} it could support {{the weight of the}} tanks, but they only had about 120 troops on the east side <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to reinforce them immediately. At about midnight the engineers opened the bridge to armor. At 12:15 am on 8 March, two platoons of nine Sherman tanks from Company A, 14th Tank Battalion, gingerly crept across the bridge in close formation following white tape left by the engineers outlining the holes. When they successfully reached the east bank, they moved into blocking positions to secure the bridgehead. Immediately behind the Shermans, an M10 Tank Destroyer from the 656th Tank Destroyer Battalion fell part way into the hole in the bridge deck left by the German demolition charge. The engineers briefly considered pushing the tank destroyer into the river, but decided they might further damage the bridge. They worked all night to jack the tank up and at 5:30 am finally got a tank on the east side to come back and pull the tank destroyer across the hole.|$|E
25|$|The Ebola {{outbreak}}, {{which was}} the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in Guinea in March 2014. The WHO warned {{that the number of}} Ebola patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months. The outbreak was accelerating. Medecins sans Frontieres has just opened a new Ebola hospital in Monrovia, and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both {{in terms of the number}} of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a full-scale humanitarian response. Brice de la Vinge, MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Peggy Ollerenshaw (Su Pollard) Chalet Maid/Yellowcoat – Peggy was {{the maid}} who looked after the staff chalet lines under the {{supervision}} of the fearsome Miss Cathcart. She always aspired to be a Yellowcoat, and tried her hardest to get involved with the entertainment in any way she could. Born in Lancashire in 1931, her father worked for the coal and gaslight company and had a passion for motorbike racing, and Peggy was an experienced rider who had a licence by the time she was 16. Her father had died by the time she joined Maplins, and Peggy was supporting her widowed mother from her wages. In addition to her regular duties, she often helped out the entertainment staff, and could always be seen in the evenings in the Hawaiian ballroom, enjoying (and often joining in with) the evening entertainments. She frequently tried to get involved in the entertainment events, but was always stopped by Gladys, who forbade Peggy's involvement as she was not on the entertainment staff. However, on several occasions, Gladys was overruled by Jeffrey Fairbrother, who allowed Peggy to take part in certain events, which usually involved dressing up in silly costumes to take the place of certain members of the entertainment staff (usually Yvonne) who found it humiliating. Peggy used to play the organ in chapel, and stepped in when Ramona didn't turn up to play at the Marines event. Peggy had a rather vivid imagination and was often easily taken in by others' lies, particularly Ted's ridiculous tales when he needed a cover story. Peggy finally became a Yellowcoat in the final episode, when Dawn was hospitalised <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a replacement. After spending just one day as a Yellowcoat, she collapsed from nervous exhaustion and was admitted to hospital. Her job as a Yellowcoat was tragically short-lived, due to Maplins abolishing Yellowcoats after the 1960 season. She stayed on at the camp temporarily after the season ended, but in her old position as a chalet maid, claiming it was still a job and better than being out of work. It was left unknown whether Peggy continued working at Maplins after the 1960 season or whether she moved on.|$|E

They found in the editing room a nice shot of the moon, and they cut it in, and it worked. Twenty years go by. I'm at the studio one day. Chuck comes running up to me, says, 'You've got to see this!'

500|$|Christopher Lloyd {{was cast}} as Doc Brown {{after the first}} choice, John Lithgow, became unavailable. Having worked with Lloyd on The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai (1984), {{producer}} Neil Canton suggested him for the part. Lloyd originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after reading the script and at the persistence of his wife. He improvised some of his scenes, taking inspiration from Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski. Brown pronounces gigawatts as [...] "jigawatts", which was the way a physicist said the word when he met with Zemeckis and Gale as they researched the script, rather than with an initial hard [...] "g", although both pronunciations are acceptable.

500|$|The game's story, {{primarily}} {{written by}} Sato, was based around a central narrative complemented by side-stories. The setting and gameplay were decided upon before Sato was brought on board, {{with the result}} that she needed to consult {{the rest of the team}} when she wished to use one of Eorzea's main locations in a certain way. The story's main conflict was to be among the five main races of Eorzea and the Beastmen, with the Garlean Empire acting as a third force. The placement of the Garlean Empire to the northeast of Eorzea was not meant to simulate a real-world location, but naturally ended up there as the map of Hydaelyn was being created. The game's logo, designed by Amano, was designed around the importance of weapons and the concept of a wheel: the [...] "wheel" [...] in question was a wheel of adventurers, arranged so their backs were exposed <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to rely on their comrades and friends for support.|$|E
500|$|In England the {{tradition}} of documenting garden plants was established long before Linnaeus' Species Plantarum starting with the herbals, but the most prominent early chronicler was Philip Miller (1691–1771) who was a master gardener {{in charge of the}} Chelsea Physic Garden in London from 1722 to 1770. New plants were coming into Western Europe from southern Europe and the overseas colonies of the Dutch, British and French. These new plants came largely to the botanic gardens of Amsterdam, Leiden, Chelsea and Paris <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> recording. In 1724 Miller produced a two-volume compendium of garden plants called The Gardeners and Florists Dictionary or a complete System of Horticulture. The first edition was in 1724, subsequently revised and enlarged until the last and 8th edition in 1768 by which time he had adopted Linnaean binomials. For a while this publication was taken as the starting point for [...] "horticultural" [...] nomenclature equivalent to Linnaeus' Species Plantarum which is now taken as the starting point for botanical nomenclature in general. Miller's Dictionary was the first of many English horticultural compendia whose history has been traced by William Stearn.|$|E
