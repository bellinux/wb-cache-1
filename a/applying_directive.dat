The adoption of such an ontology reduces the justificatory force of commonsense, which is key in arguing that we are animals and that we persist as long as we are biologically alive.

40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} sample preparation method based on solvent extraction, followed by low temperature cleanup, was demonstrated {{to be applicable}} for the determination of avermectin and milbemycin residues in bovine muscle by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography with fluorescence (LC-FL) detection. The analytical methodology was validated according to the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, using LC-MS/MS for confirmatory and LC-FL for quantitative purposes. Mean recovery was between 88. 9 and 100. 7 % in three distinct concentrations. The coefficient of variation for repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility ranged from 0. 78 to 5. 1 % and from 0. 28 to 9. 0 %, respectively. Method precision led to satisfactory values of decision limits (CCα) and detection capabilities (CCβ). The proposed method has been applied in the Brazilian National Residue Control Plan since 2010 for the determination of avermectins and milbemycin residues in bovine muscle samples. A total of 760 samples were analyzed {{and none of them}} presented residues at concentrations above the permitted levels established by the more recently <b>applied</b> <b>directives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{measurements}} are conducted in room environments at 60 GHz {{to analyze the}} channel characteristics for various channel configurations. Channel parameters retrieved from {{measurements are}} presented and analyzed based on generic channel models. Particularly, a simple single-cluster model is applied for the parameter retrieval and performance evaluation. By this model, power delay profiles are simply described by a -factor, a root-mean-squared delay spread, and a shape parameter. The considered channels are configured with the combination of omnidirectional, fan-beam, and pencil-beam antennas at transmitter and receiver sides. Both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) channels are considered. Further, to evaluate the transmission performance, we analyze the link budget in the considered environments, then design and simulate an OFDM system with a data rate of 2 Gbps to compare the bit-error-rate (BER) performance by using the measured and modeled channels.
