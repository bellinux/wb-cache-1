25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing steering control. The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for the steering control system. A crew member overheard {{there was going to}} be a test, and in an attempt to be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>charger</b> and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the right-angle drives sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there is}} a risk of {{short-circuiting}} <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>charger,</b> the risk is minimal and often mitigated by the circuitry of the battery charger itself. On the other hand, the short circuit current of the lead-acid batteries installed in vehicles is sufficiently great, that a short circuit could result in a fire or explosion. The priority is therefore given to avoiding short circuits of the vehicle battery, rather than of the charger.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{abilities}} {{of a domestic}} DECT Generic Access Profile (GAP) system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same telephone jack.

Handsets can in many cases be used as intercoms, communicating between each other, and sometimes as walkie-talkies, intercommunicating without telephone line connection.|$|E
