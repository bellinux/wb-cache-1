40|$|This study investigates {{strategic}} planning by intercollegiate <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> competing in Division I-A, the Football Bowl Subdivision. Specifically, this study attempts {{to identify the}} formal {{strategic planning}} processes used by Division I-A <b>athletic</b> <b>departments.</b> Formal planning processes were identified by searching for evidence of traditional strategic planning process components commonly cited in strategic planning literature - goal setting, environmental scanning, employee participation, and plan implementation tactics. In addition, this study identifies the benefits of strategic planning and the challenges that make strategic planning a difficult task for intercollegiate <b>athletic</b> <b>departments.</b> The study culminates {{with the creation of}} a strategic planning process model specifically for intercollegiate <b>athletic</b> <b>departments.</b> It is hoped that this model, combined with greater knowledge of strategic planning processes and the benefits and challenges of strategic planning, will allow Division I-A <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> to maximize the benefits of using strategic planning as a management tool...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend of}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I <b>{{athletic}}</b> <b>departments</b> merging under one athletic director has been ongoing for over twenty years. Colleges and universities {{across the country}} have continually chosen to restructure their <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> under one <b>athletic</b> director, instead of retaining one for women’s sports and one for men’s sports. In September 2004, Brigham Young University became the latest on a long list of <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> that have succumbed to the financial, social, and institutional pressures to merge <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> under the roof of one athletic director (Harmon, 2004). This nationwide movement continues to effect women who have served as athletic directors’ of separate women’s programs at NCAA Division I institutions, as well as those females leading merged NCAA Division I <b>athletic</b> <b>departments.</b> The result has been an overall {{decrease in the number of}} female athletic directors at the NCAA Division I level...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2005 season, an NCAA {{investigation}} found that eleven ineligible players had played for the Yellow Jackets between the 1998 and 2005 seasons. These players played while not making progress towards graduation on the NCAA-approved schedule. The football victories for that season were initially revoked, and Georgia Tech was put on two years of NCAA probation. Twelve football scholarships were stricken from Georgia Tech's allotment for the 2006 and 2007 freshman classes. The Georgia Tech <b>Athletic</b> <b>Department</b> appealed this decision by the NCAA, and the records were restored but scholarship reductions and probation remained. Athletic Director Dave Braine retired in January 2006, and Dan Radakovich was hired as Athletic Director.|$|E

There are few published articles dealing with the specific topic of the daily operations of maintaining an athletic medical insurance program. We sent an 18 -item questionnaire to the 295 active NCAA Division I head athletic trainers to ascertain the current trends in athletic medical insurance. Of these, 207 (70 %) responded. Of the respondents, 85 % were primarily responsible for the administration of their <b>athletic</b> <b>department's</b> insurance coverage, although they had received no formal training in insurance management.

5|$|After graduation, he {{remained}} at his alma mater, Minnesota, for one season {{as an assistant}} coach in 1914. Tulane University selected Shaughnessy as head football coach in 1915 over potential candidates Dana X. Bible and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame assistant coach Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unable to travel to New Orleans for an interview, and Tulane officials required a face-to-face meeting with the applicants. The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ adjusted for inflation) to be its football, basketball, and track coach, and athletic director. When he arrived, he found the football field in a state of disrepair and the equipment to be woefully inadequate. Because the <b>athletic</b> <b>department</b> was in dire financial straits, Shaughnessy paid to purchase new equipment for the team.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the profitability of}} Division I athletic programs at {{colleges and universities in}} the United States under a variety of accounting definitions of profit. The data identify several broad themes.

Without such funding, {{less than a third of}} BCS <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> and no non-BCS departments are in the black. Second, athletic programs rely heavily on contributions to balance their books. Donations to <b>athletic</b> <b>departments</b> may serve as a substitute for donations to the rest of the university, lowering giving to other programs. Third, football and men’s basketball programs are generally highly profitable at BCS schools, but below this top tier, fewer than 10 % of football programs and 15 % of men’s basketball programs show a profit by any reasonable accounting measures.
