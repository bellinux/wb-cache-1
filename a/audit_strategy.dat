40|$|AbstractThis study investigates {{changes in}} <b>audit</b> <b>strategy</b> in China {{following}} {{the introduction of}} risk-based auditing standards rather than an internal control-based audit mode. Specifically, we examine whether auditors are implementing the risk-based audit mode to evaluate corporate governance before distributing audit resources. The results show that under the internal control-based audit mode, the relationship between audit effort and corporate governance was weak. However, implementation of the risk-based mode required by the new auditing standards has significantly enhanced the relationship between audit effort and corporate governance. Since the change in audit mode, the Big Ten have demonstrated a significantly better grasp of governance risk and allocated their audit effort accordingly, relative to smaller firms. The empirical evidence indicates that auditors have adjusted their <b>audit</b> <b>strategy</b> to meet the regulations, risk-based auditing is being achieved to a degree, reasonable and effective corporate governance helps to optimize audit resource allocation, and smaller auditing firms in particular should urgently strengthen their risk-based auditing capability.

40|$|Agent based {{models are}} {{proposed}} as an adequate {{tool for analysing}} tax payer decisions and, thereby, the consequences of such decisions as they manifest themselves at the macro level. TAXSIM models the conduct of agents of three types, i. e. employers, employees and the government, in an economy of a single sector. Using this model, we examine the conduct of each individual agent {{and the impact of}} their decisions on the size of tax evasion and aggregated tax revenues. The main objective is the analysis of the relations between the government and tax payers, as well as the identification of how this relationship affects tax evasion. In this paper, the operation of several factors affecting the incidence of non-registered employment is studied {{with the help of an}} improved version of the TAXSIM agent-based simulation model. We analyse the effects of unemployment experience, the quality of government services and the <b>audit</b> <b>strategy</b> of the tax authority on totally hidden, mixed (hidden and legal) and totally legal payments. We start by a brief overview of the TAXSIM model and introduce the novel components in detail.

Their results showed that in the internal control based-audit method, there is a weak relationship between audit efforts and corporate governance. However, {{the implementation of a}} risk-based approach, which is obligatorily based on the new auditing standards, significantly strengthened the relationship between corporate governance and auditing efforts. Further, they pointed out that ever since the change in the auditing method, ten large auditing firms came into existence, which have demonstrated a better understanding of governance risk as compared with smaller firms, and perform their audit efforts on this basis. Empirical evidence suggested that auditors have changed their <b>audit</b> <b>strategy</b> to comply with laws and regulations, and risk-based auditing is partly accepted. Also, logical and efficient corporate governance contribute to optimization of the allocation of audit resources. In particular, audit firms should strengthen their risk-based auditing capabilities.

40|$|In a Costly State Verification world, {{an agent}} who has private {{information}} regarding {{the state of the}} world must report what state occurred to a principal, who can verify the state at a cost. An agent then has what is called "ex post moral hazard": he has an incentive to misreport the true state to extract rents from the principal. Assuming the principal cannot commit to an <b>auditing</b> <b>strategy,</b> the optimal contract is such that: (1) the agent's expected marginal utility when there is an accident (high- and low-loss states) is equal to his marginal utility when there is no accident; (2) the lower loss is undercompensated, while the higher loss is overcompensated; and (3) the welfare of the agent is greater under commitment than under no-commitment. Result 2 is contrary to the results obtained if the principal can commit to an <b>auditing</b> <b>strategy</b> (higher losses underpaid and lower losses overpaid).

40|$|Abstract—Cloud storage {{services}} have become commercially {{popular due to}} their overwhelming advantages. To provide ubiquitous always-on access, a cloud service provider (CSP) maintains multiple replicas for each piece of data on geographically distributed servers. A key problem of using the replication technique in clouds {{is that it is}} very expensive to achieve strong consistency on a worldwide scale. In this paper, we first present a novel consistency as a service (CaaS) model, which consists of a large data cloud and multiple small audit clouds. In the CaaS model, a data cloud is maintained by a CSP, and a group of users that constitute an audit cloud can verify whether the data cloud provides the promised level of consistency or not. We propose a two-level auditing architecture, which only requires a loosely synchronized clock in the audit cloud. Then, we design algorithms to quantify the severity of violations with two metrics: the commonality of violations, and the staleness of the value of a read.
