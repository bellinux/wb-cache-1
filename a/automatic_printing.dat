50|$|Working in the company’s {{office in}} Iquique, Chile, he became tired of using {{hand-operated}} Morse keys and Wheatstone tape punches, {{and came up}} with the idea of a typewriter-style machine that would allow the operator to punch Morse code signals onto paper tape simply by pressing the appropriate character key. Creed quit his job and moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he began work in an old shed. Using an old typewriter bought from the Sauchiehall Street market, he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper.

It then describes a simple <b>automatic</b> <b>printing</b> press that can in principle (given enough paper, ink, and time) print all the English works that have ever been, or ever will be, printed (a more-systematic version of the infinite monkey theorem).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a component grouping problem in an <b>automatic</b> <b>printed</b> circuit board (PCB) assembly line with several non-identical placement machines. After {{the problem is}} defined, an integer linear programming model is formulated {{with the objective of}} minimising the cycle time of the assembly line. The integer linear programming model can be solved by the general branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm; however, it is not efficient. So, the integer linear programming model is relaxed as a linear programming formulation because a near-optimal solution is acceptable in the real situation. A new algorithm is developed for the dual of the linear programming model. To demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm, an example is presented and compared with its integer solution from a commercial package, CPLEX.

40|$|Arabic {{language}} {{is one of}} the most popular languages in the world. Hundreds of millions of people in many countries around the world speak Arabic as their native speaking. However, due to complexity of Arabic language, recognition of printed and handwritten Arabic text remained untouched for a very long time compared with English and Chinese. Although, in the last few years, significant number of researches has been done in recognizing printed and handwritten Arabic text, it stills an open research field due to cursive nature of Arabic script. This paper proposes <b>automatic</b> <b>printed</b> Arabic text recognition technique based on linear and ellipse regression techniques. After collecting all possible forms of each character, unique code is generated to represent each character form. Each code contains a sequence of lines and ellipses. To recognize fonts, a unique list of codes is identified to be used as a fingerprint of font. The proposed technique has been evaluated using over 14000 different Arabic words with different fonts and experimental results show that average recognition rate of the proposed technique is 86 %.

40|$|Printed {{electronics}} {{is quickly}} emerging with tremendous {{value in a}} wide variety of latest electrical engineering areas. However, restricted to the rather limited conductive inks and printing strategies, the currently existing electronics manufacturing tools are generally complicated, expensive, time, material, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the industrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated for the first time an entirely <b>automatic</b> <b>printing</b> system for personal electronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink delivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing the solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling algorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive patterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like integrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards, decoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more do-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment with high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached personal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art technologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the proposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid metal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed through theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. This clearly beyond-the-lab technology and pervasively available liquid metal printer opens the way for large scale home level electronics making in the coming time...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The <b>automatic</b> {{recognition}} of <b>printed</b> Farsi (Persian) texts {{is complicated by}} several properties of the Farsi script: (a) connectivity of symbols, (b) similarity of groups of symbols, (c) highly variable widths, (d) subword overlap, and (e) line overlap. In this paper, a technique for the <b>automatic</b> {{recognition of}} <b>printed</b> Farsi texts is presented and its steps are discussed as follows: (1) digitization, (2) editing, (3) line separation, (4) subword separation, (5) symbol separation, (6) recognition, and (7) postprocessing. The most notable contributions of this work are in algorithms for steps (5) and (6) above. Practical application of the technique to Farsi newspaper headlines has been 100 % successful. However, smaller type fonts, {{which could not be}} handled by the coarse digitization hardware used, will no doubt result in less than perfect recognition. The technique is also applicable with little or no modification to printed Arabic and Urdu texts which use the same alphabet as Farsi.
