Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects</b> into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their glans for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects.</b> Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} {{to make a name for}} himself as a serious history painter, given that the subject of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects,</b> later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist examined a number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E
