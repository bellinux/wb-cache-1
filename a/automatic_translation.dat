At first, the work describes {{a brief history of}} machine translation. Then the work describes the basic principles of machine translation like the rule-based machine transla-tion, the statistical machine translation, the hybrid machine translation and the by com-puter aided translation. The online translators GT and MB are introduced as well. These translators are completed by specific studies of correctness their evaluations. The <b>automatic</b> <b>translations</b> of these tranlators are evaluated on the based of outlined typology of resulting mistakes.

40|$|Given the {{significant}} improvements in Machine Translation (MT) quality and the increasing demand for <b>translations,</b> post-editing of <b>automatic</b> <b>translations</b> is becoming a popular practice in the translation industry. It {{has been shown to}} allow for larger volumes of translations to be produced, saving time and costs. In addition, the post-editing of <b>automatic</b> <b>translations</b> can help understand problems in such translations and this can be used as feedback for researchers and developers to improve MT systems. Finally, post-editing {{can be used as a}} way of evaluating the quality of translations in terms of how much effort these translations require in order to be fixed. We describe a standalone tool that has two main purposes: facilitate the post-editing of translations from any MT system so that they reach publishable quality and collect sentence-level information from the post-editing process, e. g. : post-editing time and detailed keystroke statistics...|$|R

The outputs provided by standard statistical machine translations are mostly grammatically inaccurate or semantic-pragmatically inadequate. This paper proposes a question under discussion based annotation {{to improve the}} statistical correspondence. The results show {{the accuracy of the}} outputs was significantly increased as regards fidelity, adequacy and grammaticality...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{networks}} have been increasingly used in text analysis, including {{in connection with}} natural language processing tools, as important text features appear to be captured by the topology and dynamics of the networks. Following previous works that apply complex networks concepts to text quality measurement, summary evaluation, and author characterization, we now focus on machine translation (MT). In this paper we assess the possible representation of texts as complex networks to evaluate cross-linguistic issues inherent in manual and machine translation. We show that different quality translations generated by NIT tools can be distinguished from their manual counterparts by means of metrics such as in-(ID) and out-degrees (OD), clustering coefficient (CC), and shortest paths (SP). For instance, we demonstrate that the average OD in networks of <b>automatic</b> <b>translations</b> consistently exceeds the values obtained for manual ones, and that the CC values of source texts are not preserved for manual translations, but are for good <b>automatic</b> <b>translations.</b> This probably reflects the text rearrangements humans perform during manual translation. We envisage that such findings could lead to better NIT tools and automatic evaluation metrics...|$|R
