40|$|Violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers {{has become}} a major concern for most {{humanitarian}} agencies. Adding to the destruction and chaos of conflict, deliberate attacks on humanitarian staff and facilities cause maximum damage to the health of populations. As long as they are being targeted, aid agencies cannot operate effectively and help the most vulnerable. This also poses a severe problem to the international community because deliberate attacks undermine the fundamental principles of humanitarian action. Irregular warfare, meaning governments fighting armed groups mostly in their own territory, has become the norm. These modern wars pose a challenge to the enforcement of international law and humanitarian principles. This study shows that micro-dynamics leading to attacks <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers are closely related to territorial control of armed groups. Government and rebel groups greatly benefit from the services provided by humanitarian agencies. Most armed groups are highly dependent on support from the civilian population. The delivery of crucial services to civilians makes aid agencies important actors when securing the support of civilians for whichever actor controls a territory. Renouncing them from aid deliveries may undermine popular support. This thesis argues that violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers can be a strategy to undermine the enemy's civilian base of support and is thus less likely in territory where an armed group has full control. In contested territory, however, in which no armed group has full control and compete over popular support, violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers is more likely. In order to study micro-dynamics in conflicts, a quantitative study on the subnational level in Africa is undertaken. The subnational level of the study is based on 0. 5 longitude/latitude gid cells that rasterize the entire African continent. To ensure better comparability, the cells are pre-processed with coarsened exact matching. The results show that violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers is most likely in contested territory, as opposed to government- or rebel-held territory. The robustness prevails over a series of model specifications and robustness tests with alternative models. This analysis may help aid agencies to better plan their operations in conflict-affected zones...|$|R

50|$|Jeffries and Ryan (2001) {{argue that}} the modern concept of {{separation}} of church and state dates from the mid-twentieth century rulings of the Supreme Court.

Jeffries and Ryan {{argue that the}}se two propositions—that public aid should not go to religious schools and that public schools should not be religious—make up the separationist position of the modern Establishment Clause.|$|R

25|$|Ashman was {{initially}} reluctant {{to agree to}} work on Beauty and the Beast because he had just recently been diagnosed with AIDS. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for Aladdin (1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed The Little Mermaid. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed {{to work on the}} film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in Burbank, California to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed. It was later revealed that he viewed the Beast's curse as an allegory for AIDS, and that the mob song 'Kill The Beast' was inspired by public sentiment at the time <b>against</b> <b>AIDS</b> and the gay community.|$|E

30|$|Data {{from the}} Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD) {{indicates}} that since 2009, kidnappings {{have become the}} most frequent means of violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers of all types—national NGOs, INGOs, the UN, ICRC/Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, internationals and locals included. In 2009, {{it was estimated that}} 85 % of kidnapping cases did not end in death. There has also been a year-on-year upward trend for major attacks of all types (resulting in death or serious injury) (Stoddard et al. 2012, p. 2). A 2013 report also paints a disturbing picture of the developing security situation for humanitarian workers, stating that the number of major attacks rose again in 2012 to 167 major incidents (Harmer et al., 2013, p. 1) for the fourth time in a decade. That year, kidnappings accounted for a quarter of all major attacks on aid operations and 36 % of aid worker victims (ibid, p. 3). In 2014, a subsequent report confirmed that 2013 was ‘another record-breaking year for violence <b>against</b> <b>aid</b> workers’ with 460 victims (Stoddard et al. 2014, p. 2). Both the number of attacks and number of victims were the highest ever—a rise of 66 % in number of victims and 48 % rise in number of separate attacks over the previous year (ibid, p. 2). Kidnappings again were amongst the most prevalent types of incident—out of 460 major incidents, 134 involved kidnapping (ibid, p. 4).|$|R
