2500|$|If {{the load}} on a column is applied {{through the center}} of gravity (centroid) of its cross section, it is called an axial load. A load at any other point in the cross section is known as an {{eccentric}} load. A short column under the action of an axial load will fail [...] by direct compression before it buckles, but a long column loaded in the same manner will fail by springing suddenly outward laterally (buckling) in a bending mode. The buckling mode of deflection is considered a failure mode, and it generally occurs before the <b>axial</b> <b>compression</b> stresses (direct compression) can cause failure of the material by yielding or fracture of that compression member. However, intermediate-length columns will fail by a combination of direct compressive stress and bending.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vertical}} column supporting a plate with an offset weight {{must be in}} <b>axial</b> <b>compression</b> and flexure. Here the <b>axial</b> <b>compression</b> is carried by the bearing at the top beam in most balance scales, the lower beam just being supported horizontally at midpoint by {{the body of the}} scales by a simple peg-in-slot arrangement, so it effectively hangs beneath the top beam and stops the platforms from rotating. The flexural force in the column (a.k.a. bending moment) is taken by a pair of equal and opposite forces in the horizontal beams. So if the offset weight is towards the outside of the platform, further from the centre of the scales, the top beam will be in axial tension and the bottom beam will be in <b>axial</b> <b>compression.</b> These tensions and compressions are carried by horizontal reactions from the central supports, {{the other side of the}} scales is not affected at all, nor is the balance of the scales.|$|E

40|$|Sensory nerves {{emanating from}} the dorsal root {{extensively}} innervate the surfaces of mammalian bone, a privileged location for the regulation of biomechanical signaling. Here, we show that NGF-TrkA signaling in skeletal sensory nerves is an early response to mechanical loading of bone and is required to achieve maximal load-induced bone formation. First, the elimination of TrkA signaling in mice harboring mutant TrkA(F 592 A) alleles was found to greatly attenuate load-induced bone formation induced by <b>axial</b> forelimb <b>compression.</b> Next, both in vivo mechanical loading and in vitro mechanical stretch were shown to induce the profound up-regulation of NGF in osteoblasts within 1 h of loading. Furthermore, inhibition of TrkA signaling following <b>axial</b> forelimb <b>compression</b> was observed to reduce measures of Wnt/β-catenin activity in osteocytes in the loaded bone. Finally, the administration of exogenous NGF to wild-type mice was found to significantly increase load-induced bone formation and Wnt/β-catenin activity in osteocytes. In summary, these findings demonstrate that communication between osteoblasts and sensory nerves through NGF-TrkA signaling is essential for load-induced bone formation in mice...|$|R

It is highly related to the ‘slenderness limit’ that is the cut-off between elements being classed ‘slender’ or ‘stocky’. The slender walls are vulnerable to buckling failure modes, including Euler in-plane buckling due to <b>axial</b> <b>compression,</b> Euler out-of-plane buckling due to <b>axial</b> <b>compression</b> and lateral torsional buckling due to bending moment.
