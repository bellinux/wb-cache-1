40|$|ABSTRACT On 6 December 1994, the Norwegian {{parliament}} – the Storting – {{passed a}} resolution that approves of Norwegian participation in military operations for NATO that are undertaken beyond the territory of NATO (out-of-area operations) even in cases when the United Nations’ Security Council has not authorised such action. Until this resolution (Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94) was passed, Norway’s foreign policy had been that out-of-area operations would only be undertaken upon Security Council authorisation. The policy expressed in the resolution was sealed in March 1999, when Norwegian aircrafts participated in NATO’s bombing of Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro {{despite the lack of}} an explicit Security Council mandate. Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 was passed with dissenting votes and reflects opposing views about Norway’s moral bonds: On the one hand, a duty not to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations to adhere to the rules in international law {{and on the other hand}} a duty to participate in such operations to undertake the obligations as a NATO member. This thesis asks whether the Storting passed a morally justifiable resolution when it decided that Norway was going to participate in NATO out-of-area operations that were about to be undertaken without a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. This question is answered by investigating the premises upon which Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 rests: (i) 	Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 does not represent a violation of the rules concerning the resort to military force in international law, or (ii) 	Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 represents a violation of the rules concerning the resort to military force in international law, but there were adequate reasons for giving priority to the obligation towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations to the detriment of the obligation to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of international law. This thesis finds that the first premise is invalid because Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 clearly falls outside of the scope of the UN Charter and because there is poor evidence that customary international law has replaced the Charter provisions. In determining whether Norway is obligated towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of area operations, it is asked whether such participation constitutes part of Norway’s fair share of the burden as a NATO member. Having explored two burden-sharing principles to establish what Norway’s fair share of the burdens consists in, the discussion concludes that assessing what Norway’s fair share of the burden consists in proves inappropriate for determining whether Norway is obligated towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations. For this reason, the duty of reciprocity is explored to assess whether Norway owes NATO participation as a return for received benefits. The moral requirement to reciprocate, it is concluded, imposes a duty on Norway to reciprocate since the country willingly and knowingly has received benefits as a NATO member. By participating in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations, Norway fulfils this obligation. These conclusions imply that the Storting faced a situation where two requirements pointed the Storting in opposing directions. Participating in non-UN-mandated out-of-area, which the duty towards NATO requires, is in conflict with fulfilling the obligation to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of international law. Likewise, fulfilling the duty to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of international law dissatisfies the duty to make returns for received benefits. Therefore, the two duties are subjected to scrutiny again in order to determine whether the Storting had adequate reasons for giving priority to the obligation towards NATO. It is shown that the Storting did not demonstrate the existence of adequate reasons for giving priority to the duty towards NATO over the duty to towards the international community. Consideration of all relevant arguments in this particular situation demonstrated that the Storting could have done less harm by acting differently. While keeping an important promise made towards the international community to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of international law was possible without dissatisfying the obligation towards NATO altogether, fairness towards NATO was incompatible with the obligation towards the international community. This thesis concludes that the Storting did not adopt a morally justifiable resolution when passing Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94...|$|E

By showing that node triplets in the adjacency graph need to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of a geometric vector space, the study shows that the number of randomly chosen node triplets failing consistency checks grow at the order of O(base^ 3), where base is the granularity of the distance metric. Further, the study models and presents a probability estimate with which any randomly generated adjacency matrix would fail realization. This information could be used to design simpler algorithms for generating k-connected wireless topologies. Comment: 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental legal {{principles}} may {{function as}} a check on legislative power protecting citizens against arbitrary interferences with their liberty. This contribution deals with the principle of equality and the principle of certainty. First, the testing of legislation against the principle of equality {{is presented as a}} case study of constitutional review. In the Netherlands, the constitutional dialogue between the legislator and the Dutch Supreme Court revolving around the principle of equality demonstrates a fair amount of subtle details. As a result, constitutional review can hardly be called an all or nothing affair. Secondly, retroactive tax legislation is dealt with. The legislator does seem to take the principle of legal certainty, another fundamental legal principle, quite seriously, although no testing of statutory legislation is possible by the courts. With regard to retroactive tax legislation the Government has committed itself in a memorandum, requested by Parliament, to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of conduct with regard to different situations where it deems retroactive tax legislation to be justified. Thus, a soft law instrument facilitates a dialogue between different partners in the business of law-making. </p...|$|E

However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the possibility of affording armed groups a degree of participation in law-making processes, in large part due to the argument that this might inappropriately legitimize such groups. Although it is not realistic for non-state armed groups (NSAGs) to fully participate in multilateral treaty-making processes, it will be argued that it is possible to include some of their views in the development of future humanitarian rules. In this paper, I will deal with four mechanisms through which armed groups could be included in law-making processes. Special consideration will be given to the Geneva Call Deed of Commitment in the case of Sudan as this provides an example of the way in which the commitment of an armed group to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of international humanitarian law can influence the position of states in connection with ratifying treaties on IHL (in this case, the Ottawa Convention) ...|$|E

It analyses the nature of these criticisms and unpacks some invalid assumptions implicit in them. It argues that a criminal proceeding in which there are breaches of constitutional, statutory or common law principles of due process is inconsistent with either a therapeutic design of law or a therapeutic application of law, or with both. As with their mainstream counterparts, individual therapeutic-focused courts and programs can, and sometimes do, breach due process by failing to <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> and standards by which they are regulated and on which they are modelled. But these breaches are not a manifestation of any fundamental incompatibility between therapeutic jurisprudence and the role of a team-oriented judge or lawyer on the one hand, and due process principles and the constitutional or ethical obligations of that same judge or lawyer on the other. The conceptual basis of the therapeutic jurisprudence method, articulated in a form describe here as the “TJ imperative”, together with the procedural protections it demands, preclude any such incompatibility...|$|E

These basic units of creation <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of operation, replication, organization, and are implicated in {{the maintenance of a}} delicate system. When cells mutate, when foreign agents such as viruses infiltrate or are introduced into the body, the assault is on the cellular level. It is from this point that we can trace the escalation of symptoms and effects. This project examined how the scientific language of genetics and epidemiology can be used to read a literary narrative as a body. Narrative is a system that replicates, moves and maintains itself much as cells and bodies do. Assaults upon and interventions into teleology, subjectivity and conventions of realism by the postmodern are seen in terms of mutations and viral invasions. Literature as a product of late twentieth century culture represents a physical emission of the reading subject's fear of infection, invasion, and the instability of the body. The project involved reading the inner narrative structure of a text as DNA and examining the exterior consumption of a cultural text in terms of its similarities to the transmission of a virus. This project enunciated a theoretical paradigm that used scientific language to examine the matrix of interaction between text, reader, and culture as it exists in a climate of threat, as bodies under siege.

40|$|Respecting the {{confidentiality}} of personal data contributed to genomic studies {{is an important issue}} for researchers using genomic sequencing in humans. Although most studies <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> <b>rules</b> of confidentiality, there are different conceptions of confidentiality and why it is important. The resulting ambiguity obscures what is at stake when making tradeoffs between data protection and other goals in research, such as transparency, reciprocity, and public benefit. Few studies have examined why participants in genomic research care about how their information is used. To explore this topic, we conducted semi-structured phone interviews with 30 participants in two National Institutes of Health research protocols using genomic sequencing. Our results show that research participants value confidentiality as a form of control over information about themselves. To the individuals we interviewed, control was valued as a safeguard against discrimination in a climate of uncertainty about future uses of individual genome data. Attitudes towards data sharing were related to the goals of research and details of participants' personal lives. Expectations of confidentiality, trust in researchers, and a desire to advance science were common reasons for willingness to share identifiable data with investigators. Nearly, all participants were comfortable sharing personal data that had been de-identified. These findings suggest that views about confidentiality and data sharing are highly nuanced and are related to the perceived benefits of joining a research study. No Full Tex...|$|E
