30|$|Ascomycetes {{detected}} {{in this study}} were more varied than basidiomycetes (Fig.  3). The families <b>Aspergillaceae,</b> Leotiomycetes, and genus Scytalidium were detected frequently. Scytalidium lignicola was the most frequently detected ascomycete species in this study, which was classified as soft-rot fungus type 2 [29, 30]. Fungal species that comprised more than 5 % of fungal community in each sample are listed in Table  2. The white-rot fungi Hyphodontia sp. and Trametes hirsuta and the brown-rot fungus Antrodia sinuosa were dominant among basidiomycetes. Chrysosporium sp., Phialophora hyaline, Scytalidium lignicola, Aspergillus versicolor, and Phialophora sp. were dominant among ascomycetes that were classified as soft-rot fungi.|$|E
40|$|Aeromycological {{sampling}} during 2003 and 2004 in {{the atmosphere}} of the university campus in Madrid, showed a greater presence of spores during the spring (April–June) and from August to November. Of the groups of spores identified, conidiospores accounted for the greatest percentage (49. 5 %), followed by teliospores (18 %), basidiospores (15. 5 %) and ascospores (8 %). Seventy spore types were identified in 2003 and 83 in 2004, the most abundant of which were: Cladosporium cladosporioides (30. 2 %), Ustilago (18 %), Cladosporium herbarum (14. 5 %), Coprinus (6. 9 %), <b>Aspergillaceae</b> (2. 1 %), Lepthosphaeria (1. 7 %), Pleospora (1. 5 %) and Bovista (1. 4 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Fungi {{have long}} been known to have {{capabilities}} for reduction and alkylation of arsenate and selenate but their general capabilities for solubilizing and accumulating metallic substances have been given serious attention only in recent years. Common members of the <b>Aspergillaceae</b> cultured on boron, copper, lead and other metals or oxides can solubilize and concentrate the elements or their compounds. To account for biosolubilization of the metals, we {{have set up a}} model study, incubating selected metals, e. g., mercury, in solutions of various metabolites including L-lysine and citric acid. Results of 100 - 300 days incubation showed that many metals can in fact be readily solubilized, and in some cases more effectively at pH 6 - 7 than at pH 1. 5 - 2...|$|E
40|$|Species of Trichocomaceae occur {{commonly}} and {{are important}} to both industry and medicine. They are associated with food spoilage and mycotoxin production and can occur in the indoor environment, causing health hazards by the formation of β-glucans, mycotoxins and surface proteins. Some species are opportunistic pathogens, while others are exploited in biotechnology {{for the production of}} enzymes, antibiotics and other products. Penicillium belongs phylogenetically to Trichocomaceae and more than 250 species are currently accepted in this genus. In this study, we investigated the relationship of Penicillium to other genera of Trichocomaceae and studied in detail the phylogeny of the genus itself. In order to study these relationships, partial RPB 1, RPB 2 (RNA polymerase II genes), Tsr 1 (putative ribosome biogenesis protein) and Cct 8 (putative chaperonin complex component TCP- 1) gene sequences were obtained. The Trichocomaceae are divided in three separate families: <b>Aspergillaceae,</b> Thermoascaceae and Trichocomaceae. The <b>Aspergillaceae</b> are characterised by the formation flask-shaped or cylindrical phialides, asci produced inside cleistothecia or surrounded by Hülle cells and mainly ascospores with a furrow or slit, while the Trichocomaceae are defined by the formation of lanceolate phialides, asci borne within a tuft or layer of loose hyphae and ascospores lacking a slit. Thermoascus and Paecilomyces, both members of Thermoascaceae, also form ascospores lacking a furrow or slit, but are differentiated from Trichocomaceae by the production of asci from croziers and their thermotolerant or thermophilic nature. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Penicillium is polyphyletic. The genus is re-defined and a monophyletic genus for both anamorphs and teleomorphs is created (Penicillium sensu stricto). The genera Thysanophora, Eupenicillium, Chromocleista, Hemicarpenteles and Torulomyces belong in Penicillium s. str. and new combinations for the species belonging to these genera are proposed. Analysis of Penicillium below genus rank revealed the presence of 25 clades. A new classification system including both anamorph and teleomorph species is proposed and these 25 clades are treated here as sections.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} work the {{microbial}} degradation of cotton and silk fabrics dyed with natural dyes was studied in laboratory conditions. 100 % cotton and tussar silk {{was used as}} the fabric material for dyeing with Carrisa carandas Linn (leaves) extract as a dye source and alum as a mordant. Under laboratory conditions on the 20 th day, growth of microorganisms on dyed cotton and silk fabric was observed. Cultivation of microorganisms on PDA (Potato dextrose medium) showed the presence of fungi belonging to families Mucoraceae, <b>Aspergillaceae,</b> Mycosphaerellaceae. Where as cultivation of microorganisms on nutrient agar medium showed the presence of gram positive bacillus on cotton and well as gram negative bacilli on silk fabric. It was noted that microbial growth played a role in drastic discoloration of fabric, which changed clearly from red brown colour to pink brown colour. Growth of microorganisms were found to deteriorate the tensile and tearing strength of cotton & silk fabric...|$|E
40|$|The clavine {{alkaloids}} {{produced by}} the fungi of the <b>Aspergillaceae</b> and Arthrodermatacea families differ from the ergot alkaloids produced by Claviceps and Neotyphodium. The clavine alkaloids lack the extensive peptide chain modifications that occur in lysergic acid derived ergot alkaloids. Both clavine and ergot alkaloids arise from the condensation of tryptophan and dimethylallylpyrophosphate {{by the action of}} the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase. The first five steps of the biosynthetic pathway that convert tryptophan and dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate (DMA-PP) in chanoclavine- 1 -aldehyde are common to both clavine and ergot alkaloids. The biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids has been extensively studied and is not considered in this article. We focus this review on recent advances in the gene clusters for clavine alkaloids in the species of Penicillium, Aspergillus (Neosartorya), Arthroderma and Trychophyton and the enzymes encoded by them. The final products of the clavine alkaloids pathways derive from the tetracyclic ergoline ring, which is modified by late enzymes, including a reverse type prenyltransferase, P 450 monooxygenases and acetyltransferases. In Aspergillus japonicus, a α-ketoglutarate and Fe 2 +-dependent dioxygenase is involved in the cyclization of a festuclavine-like unknown type intermediate into cycloclavine. Related dioxygenases occur in the biosynthetic gene clusters of ergot alkaloids in Claviceps purpurea and also in the clavine clusters in Penicillium species. The final products of the clavine alkaloid pathway in these fungi differ from each other depending on the late biosynthetic enzymes involved. An important difference between clavine and ergot alkaloid pathways is that clavine producers lack the enzyme CloA, a P 450 monooxygenase, involved in one of the steps of the conversion of chanoclavine- 1 -aldehyde into lysergic acid. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequenced genomes of the <b>Aspergillaceae</b> and Arthrodermataceae fungi showed the presence of clavine gene clusters in Arthroderma species, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium commune, Penicillium camemberti, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium steckii and Penicillium griseofulvum. Analysis of the gene clusters in several clavine alkaloid producers indicates that there are gene gains, gene losses and gene rearrangements. These findings may be explained by a divergent evolution of the gene clusters of ergot and clavine alkaloids from a common ancestral progenitor six genes cluster although horizontal gene transfer of some specific genes may have occurred more recently...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} was to {{validate}} the use of outdoor-indoor volumetric impaction sampler with Hirst-type spore traps (HTSTs) to continuously monitor fungal load {{in order to prevent}} invasive fungal infections during major structural work in hospital settings. For 4 weeks, outdoor fungal loads were quantified continuously by 3 HTSTs. Indoor air was sampled by both HTST and viable impaction sampler. Results were expressed as particles/m 3 (HTST) or colony-forming units (CFU) /m 3 (biocollector). Paired comparisons by day were made with Wilcoxon's paired signed-rank test or paired Student's t-test as appropriate. Paired airborne spore levels were correlated 2 by 2, after log-transformation with Pearson's cross-correlation. Concordance was calculated with kappa coefficient (κ). Median total fungal loads (TFLs) sampled by the 3 outdoor HTSTs were 3, 025. 0, 3, 287. 5 and 3, 625. 0 particles/m 3 (P = 0. 6, 0. 6 and 0. 3). -Concordance between <b>Aspergillaceae</b> fungal loads (AFLs, including Aspergillus spp. + Penicillium spp.) was low (κ = 0. 2). A low positive correlation was found between TFLs sampled with outdoor HTST and indoor HTST with applying a 4 -hour time lag, r = 0. 30, 95 % CI (0. 23 - 0. 43), P< 0. 001. In indoor air, Aspergillus spp. were detected by the viable impaction sampler on 63. 1 % of the samples, whereas AFLs were found by HTST-I on only 3. 6 % of the samples. Concordance between Aspergillus spp. loads and AFLs sampled with the 2 methods was very low (κ = 0. 1). This study showed a 4 -hour time lag between increase of outdoor and indoor TFLs, possibly due to insulation and aeraulic flow of the building. Outdoor HTSTs may permit to quickly identify (after 48 hours) time periods with high outdoor fungal loads. An identified drawback is that a too low sample area read did not seem to enable detection of <b>Aspergillaceae</b> spores efficiently. Indoor HTSTs may not be recommended at this time, and outdoor HTSTs need further study. Air sampling by viable impaction sampler remains the reference tool for quantifying fungal contamination of indoor air in hospitals...|$|E
40|$|The list of Fungi {{which have}} been {{reported}} as parasites in the human ear is somewhat large. The number of species which are well identified is much smaller. The confusion long prevalent in the groups to which the ear-parasites belong, recently abated in the Black Moulds by A. Fischer, but still in force in the Imperfect Fungi, {{and the fact that}} otologists have not been much concerned with mycology nor always able to command the assistance of expert mycologists, have united with the inherent difficulties due to the effect of situs on the forms themselves to produce errors in determination, uncertainty, and even controversy. The greater number of the species reported and the greater number of the well identified and authenticated species belong to the <b>Aspergillaceae.</b> Next come the Mucoraceae. The Protoascineae and Pezizineae contribute one each. In addition there are several Imperfect Fungi, some of which, however, seem to owe their place upon the list to ubiquity rather than to any special adaptation to the habitat.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} synnematin B (Gottshall et al., 1951; Olson et al., 1953) {{was later}} found (Abra-ham et al., 1955) to be identical to cephalosporin N, which is (D- 4 -amino- 4 -carboxy-n-butyl) peni-cillin (Newton and Abraham, 1954). Olson et al. (1954) have reported production of 400 units of synnematin B per ml by Cephalosporium salmo-synnematum growing on a corn meal-soybean meal medium, and {{isolation of the}} antibiotic at 75 per cent purity. Abraham et al. (1954) prepared cephalosporin N of 80 per cent purity, and Clark et al. (1957) and Fusari and Machamer (1958) have recently reported purification procedures for obtaining about 85 per cent pure synnematin B. The presence of the perfect stage in {{the life cycle of}} Cephalosporia together with other mor-phological similarities have indicated that C. salmosynnematum belongs to the genus Emericel-lopsis in the family <b>Aspergillaceae</b> (Glosklags and Swift, 1957). It was found that several members of the genus Emericellopsis produce antibiotics similar to synnematin. A synthetic medium for synnematin production with Emericellopsis terricola var. glabra was re-ported by Bhuyan and Johnson (1958). Synne-matin labeled with S 35 was isolated from a C. salmosynnematum or E. terricola var. glabra fer-mentation on a natural medium (Bhuyan et al., 1958).

40|$|The {{majority}} of Trichocomaceae are saprobes and have diverse physiological properties. They {{are capable of}} growing under extreme conditions, such as extremely low water activities, low temperatures (psychrotolerant), high temperatures (thermotolerant), low acidity levels and/or low oxygen levels. Some {{are known to have}} a positive or negative impact on human activities. They are associated with food spoilage and mycotoxin production and can occur in the indoor environment, causing health hazards by the formation of β-glucans, mycotoxins and surface proteins. Some species are opportunistic pathogens, while others are exploited in biotechnology for the production of enzymes, antibiotics and other products. This thesis provides insight into the phylogeny of Trichocomaceae, taxonomy of Penicillium with emphasis on sections Citrina and Lanata-divaricata and mating behaviour of Paecilomyces variotii in relation to species delimitation and food spoilage. The phylogeny of Penicillium and its relationship with other members of Trichocomaceae was studied, and an updated list of accepted Penicillium names is provided. Using a multigene approach and phenotypic characters, the Trichocomaceae are divided in three separate families: <b>Aspergillaceae,</b> Thermoascaceae and Trichocomaceae. Phylogenetic analysis shows that Penicillium is polyphyletic and members of the subgenera Aspergilloides, Furcatum and Penicillium belong to Penicillium s. str., while the {{majority of}} species of subgenus Biverticillium belong to the redefined genus Talaromyces. Thermophilic Penicillium-like fungi (e. g. Talaromyces emersonii) have gained much attention in biotechnology the last decades, primarily because of their capacity to produce thermostable enzymes. These species are unrelated to Penicillium sensu stricto and a new genus named Rasamsonia was proposed for these fungi. Species belonging to Penicillium sections Citrina and Lanata-divaricata have a worldwide distribution and commonly occur in soils. New insights in the phylogeny and taxonomy of these sections show that section Citrina and Lanata-divaricata includes 39 species and 33 species, respectively, 22 of those are described here as new. These species have unique properties and the newly proposed classification scheme may help in determining more accurate the mycobiota of soils, which may be important for biodiversity, ecological and climate change studies. Furthermore, some of these species are associated with leaf litter decomposition and may be efficient lignocellulose degraders and could represent a new source for cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes, while others are producers of uncharacterized compounds that might represent novel drug leads (incl. novel antibiotics). Paecilomyces variotii, a species related to Penicillium, is a common cosmopolitan species that is able to spoil various food- and feedstuffs and is frequently encountered in heat-treated products. Ascospores, which are usually considered to be the heat-resistant propagule in other fungi, were rarely found in P. variotii cultures. As a result, the route of P. variotii contamination remained largely unknown. The mating type genes MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 were determined and these appeared to be evenly distributed among strains isolated from heat treated products, showing the presence of cryptic sexuality. Mating experiments indicated that P. variotii is able to form ascomata and ascospores in culture in a heterothallic manner, giving insight in the contamination route of this heat resistant fungus...|$|E
