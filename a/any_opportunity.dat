5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at <b>any</b> <b>opportunity.</b> The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
5|$|The liberal {{views of}} Wang Yangming were {{opposed by the}} Censorate and by the Donglin Academy, re-established in 1604. These conservatives wanted a revival of {{orthodox}} Confucian ethics. Conservatives such as Gu Xiancheng (1550–1612) argued against Wang's idea of innate moral knowledge, stating that this was simply a legitimization for unscrupulous behavior such as greedy pursuits and personal gain. These two strands of Confucian thought, hardened by Chinese scholars' notions of obligation towards their mentors, developed into pervasive factionalism among the ministers of state, who used <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> to impeach members of the other faction from court.|$|E

5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a thing, as a time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E

25|$|Roberto Dellasega of Italy was disqualified, and {{therefore}} excluded from <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> to advance. Norway's Anders Jacobsen did not show, {{but because he}} was pre-qualified he advanced to the competition round anyway. The top finisher in the qualifying round was Michael Uhrmann of Germany. His countryman Michael Neumayer had the second-longest jump but placed third to Czech jumper Jakub Janda because of Janda's higher judge's score. All four jumpers from the host country of Canada failed to qualify.|$|E

25|$|The Union cavalrymen {{crashed into}} the column of now lightly {{protected}} wagons. Custer, in his enthusiasm for the charge, was thrown from his horse and nearly captured. Grumble Jones also narrowly avoided capture. Pennington's artillery began shelling the wagons toward {{the rear of the}} column, splintering carriages and blocking <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> for retreat. The Union and Confederate cavalrymen became thoroughly mixed up among the wagons and the enemies were unable to differentiate themselves in the darkness. Several friendly fire incidents occurred as Union troopers accidentally fired on their own lines.|$|E
25|$|All {{the members}} of the troop are {{interested}} in the newborn, and they take advantage of <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> to examine and look at its genitals if the mother permits it. With time the baby begins to climb up on other members of the troop, including the adult males who are interested in protecting the little one. Playing behavior is principally with a companion, and all members of the troop from the alpha male, the mother and all young members of the group solicit play with the young one.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that sports during those times was very much a luxury and was only for the privileged few. The average local had few, if <b>any,</b> <b>opportunities</b> to indulge in sporting activities. For most, simply {{trying to make a living}} took up most of their time. Moreover, the older sports clubs were established mainly for the colonials.|$|R
25|$|While {{attending}} Yale University, Cavett {{played in}} and directed dramas {{on the campus}} radio station, WYBC, and appeared in Yale Drama productions. In his senior year, he changed his major from English to drama.

He would {{go so far as}} to carry a copy of Variety or an appropriate piece of company stationery in order to look inconspicuous while sneaking backstage or into a TV studio. Cavett took many odd jobs ranging from store detective to label typist for a Wall Street firm, and as a copyboy at Time Magazine.|$|E
25|$|CBS began {{experimental}} color {{field tests}} using film {{as early as}} August 28, 1940, and live cameras by November 12. NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on February 20, 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on June 1, 1941. These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no color television sets were {{available to the public}} at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942 to August 20, 1945, limiting <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> to introduce color television to the general public.|$|E
25|$|Inmates {{who were}} in the SCU for {{disciplinary}} or administrative reasons would be confined to their cells for 23.5 hours per day. They would be given half an hour of exercise, which consisted of walking alone in the corridor between cells in the SCU. A rubber pad and blanket would be delivered in the evening and collected each morning. The inmates would not have <b>any</b> <b>opportunity</b> to see the outdoors. Inmates {{who were in}} the SCU for protective custody would be allowed to retain the rubber pad and blanket throughout the day, and would sometimes be permitted to exercise outdoors for half an hour per day. Inmates were not permitted to speak to one another, work, attend school, visit the library, watch TV, or engage in any other interactive activities.|$|E
50|$|The {{educational}} level amongst Iraqis is generally very high, {{as they are}} well-educated and many of which hold university degrees. Although many have already completed higher education, {{the average age of}} an Iraqi refugee and asylum seeker is relatively low, in which the majority has not yet had <b>any</b> <b>opportunities</b> to work in their chosen profession and hence their theoretical knowledge remains undeveloped.|$|R
50|$|Slaves who lacked {{skills or}} {{education}} performed agricultural {{or other forms}} of manual labor.

Slaves subjected to harsh labor conditions also had few if <b>any</b> <b>opportunities</b> to obtain their freedom.|$|R
50|$|During the Network Era, {{the limited}} number of {{distribution}} windows created the 'distribution bottleneck'. Producers only sold series either to networks or to local stations - that allowed only a limited amount of programming to get through to viewers. Without personal recording capabilities and few alternative ways to receive programming, viewers had hardly <b>any</b> <b>opportunities</b> to re-screen content and never on their own terms.|$|R
