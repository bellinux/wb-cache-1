25|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} {{that by the end of}} 2012 the ship would enter Severodvinsk Sevmash shipyard for a major refit and modernisation, reportedly to include upgrades to obsolete electronics and sensor equipment, installation of a new anti-aircraft system and increase of the air wing by the removal of the P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles; it was thought possible that the refit would also include exchanging the troublesome steam powerplant to gas-turbine or even nuclear propulsion and installation of catapults to the <b>angled</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 1968, {{a routine}} night launch of an E-2A from VAW-123 {{led the way}} for all {{launches}} aboard Forrestal. The crew members were LCDR Paul Martin Wright (Operations Officer), LCDR James Leo Delaney (Maintenance Officer), LTJG Howard Booth Rutledge (Personnel Officer), LTJG Frank J. Frederick (Asst. Maintenance Officer), and AT1 David E. Carpenter (Avionics Dept). The flight was routine and all aircraft recovered as usual until the VAW-123 E-2A, which was the last plane to recover. The aircraft boltered and went off the <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> and into the water, nose first. When it hit the water, the aircraft flipped over onto its back, breaking its radar dome off and sank within minutes. The dome floated and was recovered. Immediately, helicopters moved into the area for search and rescue operations. AT1 David E. Carpenter and LTJG Frank J. Frederick were rescued without serious injury. Lost at sea were LCDR Wright, LCDR Delaney, and LTJG Rutledge.|$|E
25|$|The major {{modifications}} were to allow Admiral Gorshkov {{to operate as}} a STOBAR aircraft carrier in Indian service, {{as opposed to the}} STOVL configuration the ship was built as. This involved removal of all the armament, including the P-500 Bazalt cruise missile launchers and the four Antey Kinzhal surface-to-air missile bins fitted on ship's bow, {{to make way for a}} 14.3°, full-width ski-jump. The 20-ton capacity aircraft lift beside the ship's island superstructure was unchanged, but the aft lift was enlarged and its lift capacity increased to 30 tons. For STOBAR operations, three 30m arrestor wires and three restraining gears on the stern of the <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> were fitted. Sponsons were installed to increase the area of the flight deck, to allow the ski-jump to be fitted, for strengthening of arresting gear and runway area, and to lengthen the after end, which allowed an increase to the length of the landing strip aft of the arresting gear. 234 new hull sections were installed to achieve the desired shape, and the total steel added to carry out these modifications amounted to 2500 tons.|$|E

50|$|The seventh USS Ranger (CV/CVA-61) {{was one of}} four Forrestal-class supercarriers {{built for}} the United States Navy in the 1950s. Although all four ships of the class were {{completed}} with <b>angled</b> <b>decks,</b> Ranger had the distinction of being the first US carrier built from the beginning as an angled-deck ship.|$|R
500|$|Several {{designs were}} {{proposed}} for a ship carrying both aircraft {{and a gun}} armament equivalent to a light cruiser's. One design, from 1930, was described as [...] "a [...] light cruiser forwards [...] one half of a [...] aft", and utilized {{an early version of}} the <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> that would in the 1950s be adopted for use by fleet carriers. The vessel, [...] in length, had a [...] flight deck and hangar aft for twenty-four aircraft, while forwards three triple [...] gun turrets were mounted, the standard armament for a light cruiser of the time. A secondary dual purpose armament of eight [...] guns was also projected to be carried for defense against enemy torpedo-boats and aircraft.|$|E
500|$|HMS Hercules, {{the fifth}} {{ship in the}} Majestic class, was ordered on 7 August 1942 and laid down on 14 October 1943 by Vickers-Armstrongs on the River Tyne. After World War II ended with Japan's {{surrender}} on 2 September 1945, she was launched on 22 September, and her construction was suspended in May 1946. At the time of suspension, she was 75 per cent complete. Her hull was preserved, and in May 1947 she was [...] in Gareloch off the Clyde. In January 1957, she was purchased by India and was towed to Belfast to complete her construction and modifications by Harland and Wolff. Several improvements to the original design were ordered by the Indian Navy, including an <b>angled</b> <b>deck,</b> steam catapults, and a modified island.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Netherlands Navy {{acquired}} the Colossus-class [...] in 1948, and commissioned her as [...] Initially, the carrier operated piston-engined aircraft, but underwent modernisation from 1955 to 1958, including a steam catapult, reinforced flight deck and aircraft lifts, and an 8° <b>angled</b> <b>deck.</b> Between the upgrade and 1964, Karel Doorman possessed a mixed air group of jet fighters, anti-submarine aircraft, and helicopters; the fixed-wing aircraft were removed in that year.|$|E

2500|$|As completed, Vikramaditya has {{a larger}} full load {{displacement}} {{than when the}} ship was originally launched in 1982 as Baku. 1,750 out of 2,500 compartments of the ship were re-fabricated, and extensive re-cabling was done to support new radars and sensors. The elevators were upgraded, and two restraining stands were fitted, allowing combat aircraft to reach full power before making a ski jump-assisted short take-off. Three arresting gears were fitted on the aft part of the <b>angled</b> <b>deck,</b> and navigation and carrier-landing aids were added to support fixed-wing [...] "short take-off but arrested recovery" [...] (STOBAR) operations.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s on {{conventional}} carriers {{it has been}} the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> is to allow aircraft that miss the arresting wires, referred to as a bolter, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> allows the installation of one or two [...] "waist" [...] catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> also improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Although {{they were}} {{intended}} to augment the US Pacific fleet during World War II, the lead ship of the class, , was not commissioned until 10 September 1945 (eight days after the Surrender of Japan). None of the class went on war cruises during the Korean War. They were mainly deployed to the Atlantic and Mediterranean. During the 1950s, all three ships underwent the SCB-110 modernization program (similar to SCB-125 for the Essex-class carriers), which added <b>angled</b> <b>decks,</b> steam catapults, mirror landing systems, and other modifications {{that allowed them to}} operate a new breed of large, heavy naval jets.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1953 the {{squadron}} embarked on [...] with its F2H-2s to conduct evaluation {{tests on the}} Navy’s <b>angled</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{design of the}} Forrestal-class ships {{would have had a}} very small, retractable island; this design had numerous problems (the mechanism to raise and lower the island was never perfected before the <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> was added to the design) and smoke fouling of the deck was expected to be a severe problem due to lack of adequate venting. The redesign to an <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> allowed a very large island, much larger than on previous carriers, giving unprecedented flexibility and control in air operations.|$|E
5000|$|The angled {{flight deck}} was first tested on , by {{painting}} <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> markings onto the centerline flight deck for {{touch and go}} landings. This was also tested on [...] the same year. In both tests, the arresting gear and barriers remained oriented to the original axis deck. During September through December 1952 the USS Antietam had a rudimentary sponson installed for true <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> tests, allowing for full arrested landings, which proved during trials to be superior. In 1953 the USS Antietam trained with both US and British naval units, proving the worth of the <b>angled</b> <b>deck</b> concept. HMS Centaur was modified with overhanging angled flight deck in 1954. The U.S. Navy installed the decks {{as part of the}} SCB-125 upgrade for the Essex class and SCB-110/110A for the Midway class. In February 1955, HMS Ark Royal became the first carrier to be constructed and launched with the deck, followed in the same year by the lead ships of the British Majestic-class (HMAS Melbourne) and the American Forrestal-class (USS Forrestal).|$|E
2500|$|The {{period has}} seen the {{introduction}} of the <b>angled</b> flight <b>deck</b> on aircraft carriers as well as the [...] "Ski jump" [...] to aid take off and mirror landing sights. New, larger aircraft carriers are planned but keep getting postponed.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II, Navy Yard Puget Sound was {{designated}} Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. It {{engaged in an}} extensive program of modernizing carriers, including converting conventional flight <b>decks</b> to <b>angle</b> <b>decks.</b> During the Korean War, the shipyard was engaged in the activation of ships. In the late 1950s, it entered an era of new construction with {{the building of a}} new class of guided missile frigates. In 1965, USS Sculpin (SSN 590) became the first nuclear-powered submarine to be maintained at PSNS. The shipyard {{was designated}} a National Historic Landmark in 1992. [...] The historic district includes 22 contributing buildings and 42 contributing structures, as well as 49 non-contributing buildings, structures, and objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier returned home in April and rejoined the Pacific Reserve Fleet briefly. She was reactivated later that summer and, in August, transited the Panama Canal {{to join the}} Atlantic Fleet. In September, the warship entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations. In October, she was redesignated an attack {{aircraft carrier}}, CVA-36. In December 1952 Antietam emerged from the yard as the world's first carrier with a true <b>angled</b> flight <b>deck.</b> The principle had been tried on other carriers with lines painted on an axis deck. Antietams deck {{was based on a}} rudimentary sponson. The installation allowed for true <b>angle</b> <b>deck</b> tests, including arrested landings. Trials with British and US units proved during trials to be superior to the usual fore-aft deck. She operated out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island, until the beginning of 1955. During the intervening years, she participated in numerous fleet and independent ship's exercises. Detachment #39 from VC-4, NAS Atlantic City was sent out on the Antietam on June 9, 1953. The stated purpose was to show off the canted deck capabilities to the Royal Navy. There were two aircraft with pilots and 13 enlisted men.|$|R
50|$|The Forrestal-class {{aircraft}} carriers were four {{aircraft carriers}} {{designed and built}} for the United States Navy in the 1950s. It was the first class of supercarriers, combining high tonnage, deck-edge elevators and an <b>angled</b> <b>deck.</b> The first ship was commissioned in 1955, the last decommissioned in 1998.|$|E
