Statistical formulas such as regression, uncertainty coefficient, t-test, chi square, and various types of ANOVA (<b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance)</b> are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} efficacy of family cognitive behavior treatment (FCBT) and group cognitive behavior treatment (GBCT) for reducing anxiety disorders {{in children and adolescents}} using several approaches: clinical significant change, equivalence testing, and <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance.</b> It also examined treatment specificity in terms of targeting family/parents (in FCBT) and peers/group (in GCBT) contextual variables using two main approaches: <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> and structural equation modeling (SEM). ^ The sample consisted of 143 children and their parents who presented to the Child Anxiety and Phobia Program housed within the Child and Family Psychosocial Research Center at Florida International University. Diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were administered to assess youth anxiety. Questionnaires were administered to assess child and parent views of family/parents and peers/group contextual variables. ^ In terms of clinical significant change, results indicated that 84. 6 % of youth in FCBT and 71. 2 % of youth in GBCT no longer met diagnostic criteria for their primary/targeted anxiety disorder. In addition, results from <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> indicated that FCBT and GCBT were both efficacious in reducing anxiety disorders in youth across both child and parent ratings. Results using both <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variance</b> and structural equation modeling also indicated that there was no meaningful treatment specificity between FCBT and GCBT in terms of either family/parents or peers/group contextual variables. That is, child social skills improved in GCBT in which these skills were targeted and in FCBT in which these skills were not targeted; parenting skills improved in FCBT in which these skills were targeted and in GCBT in which these skills were not targeted. Clinical implications and future research recommendations are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{pilot study}} {{evaluated}} the preliminary short- and middle-term {{impact of a}} nation-wide, school-based prevention initia-tive on antisocial behaviour of preschool and primary school pupils in Luxembourg. Seventeen preschool and reception classes (n = 183) were assigned to intervention and comparison conditions. The intervention included social-emotional skills training for both preschool and recep-tion class pupils together with teacher workshops. Three waves of data (pre-test, post-test and 12 -month-follow up) were <b>analysed.</b> Univariate <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> with repeated measurements, together with <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> covariance, for this 2 × 3 design show significant inter-vention effects: a reduction in oppositional defiant and aggressive behaviour {{as well as an}} increase in social and emotional competencies for reception class pupils after a 12 -month follow-up period.

30|$|According to the <b>analyses</b> <b>of</b> <b>variances</b> (ANOVA), F {{value for}} the overall {{regression}} is significant at 5 % level {{and the lack of}} fit is insignificant indicating that the pure first-order model is very adequate in approximating the response surface of the experimental design. This statement is further supported by the satisfactory value of the coefficient of determination R 2 (0.8945). Judging from the regression coefficients and the corresponding t values, it is concluded that the linear terms of starch, corn steep powder and dry milk had significant effect on MCE production; it is predicted that increasing the concentration of starch (X 1), dry milk (X 4) and decreasing the concentration of corn steep powder (X 2) should enhance MCE production. In contrast, the soybean meal (X 3) at the tested range exhibited insignificant effect on MCE production.|$|R

The fungus {{is one of the}} most important producers of citric acid and catalytic enzymes where production is heavily determined by its present morphology.

By image processing on microscopic images the algorithm is capable of withdrawing necessary in-formation for the estimated time of germination. A simple and efficient algorithm is achieved by combining tools for binary and grayscale morphol-ogy. Consecutive evaluation on visual outputs and the indicated consistency with biology concludes on sufficient accuracy of the germination time es-timates.
