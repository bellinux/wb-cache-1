5|$|The {{character}} of Betelgeuse—envisioned by McDowell as a winged demon, who {{takes on the}} form of a short Middle Eastern man, is also intent on killing the Deetzes rather than scaring them, and wanted to rape Lydia rather than marry her. In this version of the script, Betelgeuse only needs to be exhumed from his grave to be summoned, after which he is free to wreak havoc; he cannot be summoned or controlled by saying his name three times, and wanders the world freely, appearing to torment different characters in different manifestations. McDowell's script also featured a second Deetz child, nine-year-old Cathy, the only person able to see the Maitlands and the subject of Betelgeuse's homicidal wrath in the film's climax, during which he mutilates her while in the form of <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> squirrel before revealing his true form.|$|E

On July 12, 1940, in Maloalmaatinsk gorge near Almaty, <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> snow leopard attacked two men {{during the day}} and inflicted serious injuries on both. In the second case, not far from Almaty, an old, toothless, emaciated snow leopard unsuccessfully attacked a passerby in winter; it was captured and carried to a local village. There are no other records of any snow leopard attacking a human being.|$|E

25|$|Bobcat (Lynx rufus, {{also called}} Felis rufus) — They favor {{thickets}} and patchy woods in the least-developed {{areas of the}} state, especially in the northwest highlands of Connecticut; they normally are scarce where coyotes are more prevalent. It is unknown {{whether or not the}} burgeoning coyote population has resulted in a decline in bobcats, however. Unlike coyotes, bobcats do not adapt well to nearby human populations; they prefer immature forests with a thick understory. In the 1970s the price of bobcat pelts rose so much that state officials became concerned they would be overharvested and reclassified the bobcat as a protected furbearer, with no hunting or trapping seasons. <b>A</b> <b>rabid</b> bobcat attacked a man in Plainville in 2003, but the incident is regarded as a rare, freak occurrence.|$|E
25|$|English {{heavy metal}} band Venom, from Newcastle, {{crystallized}} {{the elements of}} what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their 1981 album Welcome to Hell. Their dark, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands. Another highly influential band, Slayer, formed in 1981. Although the band was a thrash metal act, Slayer's music was more violent than their thrash contemporaries Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Their breakneck speed and instrumental prowess combined with lyrics about death, violence, war, and Satanism won Slayer <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> cult following. According to AllMusic, their third album Reign in Blood inspired the entire death metal genre. It had {{a big impact on}} genre leaders such as Death, Obituary, and Morbid Angel.|$|E
25|$|A staunch anti-communist, Woll {{eventually}} became a confidant of AFL president Samuel Gompers and other like-minded labor leaders such as William Green of the United Mine Workers of America. Green in particular relied heavily on Woll for advice and policy guidance during his term {{as president of the}} AFL. Woll also became a mentor to Jay Lovestone, the one-time Communist who was expelled from the party only to become <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> Red-baiter and AFL-CIO foreign policy advisor. In 1944, the AFL-CIO established the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) to assist free trade unions abroad, particularly in Europe. Lovestone was named its secretary, reporting (in part) to Woll. Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them with unions which supported capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support of American foreign policy goals.|$|E

25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Thomas Lundgren, on August 4, 1979, Bonin and Butts {{abducted}} a 17-year-old named Mark Shelton shortly after the youth left his Westminster home to walk to a movie theater near Beach Boulevard. Screams were heard from {{the vicinity of the}} Shelton household by neighbors, leaving a strong possibility Shelton was abducted by force. The youth was violated with foreign objects including a pool cue, causing his body to enter a state of shock which proved fatal. His body was then discarded in San Bernardino County. The following day, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old West German student named Markus Grabs attempting to hitchhike from Pacific Coast Highway. Grabs was bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire and driven to Bonin's home where he was sodomized, beaten, and stabbed a total of 77 times before his nude body was discarded in Malibu Creek, close to Las Virgenes Canyon Road. His body was found the following morning, with one investigator likening the network of injuries inflicted upon the victim to that of <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> dog unable to determine when to cease biting.|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{produced}} the first vaccine for rabies by growing {{the virus in}} rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue. The rabies vaccine was initially created by Emile Roux, a French doctor and a colleague of Pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this method. The vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial. This vaccine was used on 9-year-old Joseph Meister, on July 6, 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by <b>a</b> <b>rabid</b> dog. This was done at some personal risk for Pasteur, since {{he was not a}} licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy. After consulting with physicians, he decided {{to go ahead with the}} treatment. Over 11 days, Meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time. Three months later he examined Meister and found that he was in good health. Pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued. Analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that Pasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of Meister. One survived but may not actually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies. Pasteur began treatment of Jean-Baptiste Jupille on October 20, 1885, and the treatment was successful. Later in 1885, people, including four children from the United States, went to Pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated. In 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies. The treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. The first of the Pasteur Institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.|$|E

500|$|In late May 1918, Blackader was {{relieved}} {{of command and}} replaced by Thomas Cubitt, a younger officer.

Under Cubitt's command, the 38th Division would build on its past training and fight through the Hundred Days Offensive with great success.

He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes.
