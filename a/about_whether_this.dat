5|$|There is some dispute <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> new {{military}} structure {{was put into}} place under the Emperor Diocletian or Constantine since both reorganised the Roman Army in the late 3rd and early 4th centuries to some degree. Both Diocletian and even his predecessor of thirty years Gallienus may already have controlled mobile strategic reserves to assist the empire's border forces; either Diocletian or Constantine expanded this nascent force into permanent field armies.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 the Havana Chess Club {{offered to}} sponsor a match between Steinitz and whomever he would select as a worthy opponent. Steinitz {{nominated}} the Russian Mikhail Chigorin, {{on the condition}} that the invitation should not be presented as a challenge from him. There is some doubt <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> was intended to be a match for the world championship: both Steinitz's letters and the publicity material just before the match conspicuously avoided the phrase. The proposed match was to have a maximum of 20 games, and Steinitz had said that fixed-length matches were unsuitable for world championship contests because the first player to take the lead could then play for draws; and Steinitz was at the same time supporting the American Chess Congress' world championship project. Whatever the status of the match, it was played in Havana in January to February 1889, and won by Steinitz (ten wins, one draw, six losses).|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

50|$|The station audio is {{required}} to be passed through an audio low-pass filter which rolls off frequencies above 3 kHz, to prevent music from being played as a low power AM station.

25|$|Although {{the biblical}} {{regulation}} literally only mentions boiling (Hebrew: bishul, בישול), there were questions {{raised in the}} late Middle Ages <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> should instead be translated as cooking, and hence {{be interpreted as a}} reference to activities like broiling, baking, roasting, and frying. Lenient figures like Jacob of Lissa and Chaim ibn Attar argued that such a prohibition would only be a rabbinic addition, and not the biblical intent, but others like Abraham Danzig and Hezekiah da Silva argued that the biblical term itself had this wider meaning.|$|E
25|$|This air {{of mystery}} was {{increased}} when CRASH magazine published a reader's photograph of Lunar Jetman featuring Jetman's moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible {{existence of a}} trailer (as depicted on the game's cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game's release, and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it. The Stampers shrugged off questions <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> screen shot was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that Lunar Jetman's 48K of code does not contain graphics for a trailer.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{derived from}} milk, such as cheese and whey, have {{traditionally}} been considered to fall under the prohibition, but milk substitutes, created from non-dairy sources, do not. However, the classical rabbis were worried that Jews using artificial milk might be misinterpreted, so they insisted that the milk be clearly marked to indicate its source. In the classical era, the main form of artificial milk was almond milk, so the classical rabbis imposed the rule that almonds must be placed around such milk; in the Middle Ages, there was some debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> {{had to be done}} during cooking as well as eating, or whether it was sufficient to merely do this during the meal.|$|E

50|$|Many early Taoists {{such as the}} {{influential}} Laozi and Zhuangzi were critical of authority and advised rulers that the less controlling they were, the more stable and effective their rule would be. There is debate among contemporary anarchists <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>this</b> counts as an anarchist view.

30|$|As the {{management}} of human systems has become more globalized, so the need to effectively capture environmental diversity at global and regional scales has increased. Spanning almost one-third of the earth’s surface, the Pacific presents a daunting challenge to anyone seeking to generalize <b>about</b> it, <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> refers to its geology, its ocean, its islands, or the peoples who inhabit them. In the past, perceptions of uniformity or emptiness within the Pacific encouraged generalization (Köppen 1936; Ward 1989) and even today, when the diversity of its natural environment is almost universally acknowledged, there remains a need for informed generalization for particular purposes (e.g., Ellison 2009; Dickinson 2001; Mueller-Dombois and Fosberg 1998; Neall and Trewick 2008; Richardson and Richardson 1986).|$|R
25|$|Jurisdiction over Crown {{property}} is {{divided between the}} provincial legislatures and the federal parliament, with the key provisions Sections 108, 109, and 117 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Public works are {{the property of the}} federal Crown, and natural resources are within the purview of the provinces. Title to such {{property is}} not vested in one jurisdiction or another, however, since the Canadian Crown is indivisible. Section 109 has been given a particularly-broad meaning; provincial legislation regulating labour used to harvest and the disposal of natural resources does not interfere with federal trade and commerce power, and royalties have been held to cover the law relating to escheats. Canada cannot unilaterally create Indian reserves, since the transfer of such lands requires federal and provincial approval by Order in Council (although discussion exists <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> is sound jurisprudence).|$|E
25|$|France’s {{experience}} in Afghanistan has mirrored every other country’s misadventures in this Central Asian state; some small successes followed by some pretty devastating defeats. Initially, the French involvement in Afghanistan {{was limited to}} the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Kabul; as that mission expanded to encompass the entire country, France slowly amped up its involvement. By 2008, France had sole responsibility for Kapisa, and a district of Kabul Province that borders it. The French mission in Afghanistan has been fraught with struggle. The French military has fought very hard in Afghanistan and lost a lot of soldiers in the process: 87 since 2008 (many argue that there were more fatalities), behind only the U.S., Canada, and the UK. Yet, the newly elected French President François Hollande announced that French troops would withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of 2012– sparking speculation <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> indicated the NATO coalition there is starting to crumble.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} act {{for the new}} copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, {{stated that}} the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to all works on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> made the law applied retroactively, restoring copyrights on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. The question was resolved definitively only in 2006, when the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation confirmed the retroactivity of the 1993 law, explaining that it placed even works under copyright again if their old, Soviet 25-year term had already expired. For the neighbouring rights, which hadn't existed in Soviet times, the law granted those rights retroactively. The 1993 copyright law thus rendered the old Soviet legislation largely obsolete in Russia; it remained applicable only to copyright violations that had occurred before August 3, 1993.|$|E

The field of dyslexia has often been subject to controversy and contradictions, <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> has been through media reports of reported cures or through the ongoing debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> dyslexia exists. <b>This</b> paper will explore the evidence for co-ocurring syndromes to demonstrate how dyslexia can be seen as part of a wider spectrum of specific learning difficulties. The social model of dyslexia will also be examined, which emphasises the role of society in limiting those with specific learning difficulties as well as recognising the talents and strengths that are often present. The possibility of unifying these theories to provide a coherent understanding of specific learning difficulties will also be explored...|$|R
25|$|Given {{that the}} 1999 Act {{preserves}} the promisee's right {{to enforce the}} contract as it stood at common law, an outstanding issue is to what extent a promisee can claim damages for a benefit {{on behalf of a}} third party, if he has suffered no personal loss. In Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd, Lord Denning MR held that a father could claim damages for disappointment (beyond the financial cost) of a terrible holiday experience on behalf of his family. However, a majority of the House of Lords in Woodar Investment Development Ltd v Wimpey Construction UK Ltd disapproved any broad ability of a party to a contract to claim damages on behalf of a third party, except perhaps in a limited set of consumer contracts. There is disagreement <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> will remain the case. Difficulties also remain in cases involving houses built with defects, which are sold to a buyer, who subsequently sells to a third party. It appears that neither the initial buyer can claim on behalf of the third party, and nor will the third party be able to claim under the 1999 Act, as they will typically not be identified by the original contract (or known) in advance. Apart from this instance relating to tort, in practice the doctrine of privity is entirely ignored in numerous situations, throughout the law of trusts and agency.|$|E
25|$|The British {{administration}} in India were concerned by Ranjitsinhji; some individuals suspected {{that he intended}} to cause trouble in Nawanagar and wished to keep him out of the region. Others supported him, believing he had been treated unfairly. Kennedy, the Administrator of Nawanagar, successfully lobbied the Government of Bombay and the India Office in London to have Ranjitsinhji's allowance doubled. But concerns among senior figures in the Government of Bombay <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>this</b> was appropriate and over any potential agitation in Nawanagar by Ranjitsinhji meant that Kennedy's appeal to have the allowance further increased was unsuccessful. However, the increase was dependent upon him no longer pursuing his claim to the throne and not becoming involved in any plots in Nawanagar, and Ranjitsinhji was reluctant to have any conditions imposed on him. Then on 28 September, Ranjitsinhji wrote to the Secretary of State for India, Lord George Hamilton, through the Government of Bombay, stating his claim. He argued that he had been adopted as heir before being set aside without and enquiry, and that Jassaji was illegitimate. The Government of Bombay rejected the appeal but Ranjitsinhji was able to use his contact with Rajinder Singh to meet the Viceroy, Lord Elgin. Consequently, the Government of India began to investigate and under Elgin's successor, Lord Curzon, Ranjitsinhji's application was sent to Hamilton in London. Eventually, after Ranjitsinhji had returned to England, Hamilton also rejected the claim, but Simon Wilde believes the support he received from the princes and British officials, and the failure of anyone to point out that his adoption by Vibhaji was never carried out, must have encouraged Ranjitsinhji that his claim was viable. Having done all he could in India for the moment, he returned to England in March 1899.|$|E
