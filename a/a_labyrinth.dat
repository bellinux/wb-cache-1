5|$|Enterprising programmers {{were able}} to produce games for the ZX81 using nothing more than text {{characters}} and the machine's limited text semigraphics. Some ZX81 games achieved lasting fame, such as 3D Monster Maze, a tense first-person perspective game that involved the player escaping <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit. Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code, its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer 3D game and a landmark {{in the history of}} computer and video games.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the Vietnam War, North Vietnam supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South Vietnam. The Trail, <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, for both men and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South Vietnam. The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E
5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and disagree about whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E

50|$|The name Polyacanthidae {{has also}} been used for this family. Some fish now {{classified}} as gouramis were previously placed in family Anabantidae. The subfamily Belontiinae was recently demoted from the family Belontiidae. <b>As</b> <b>labyrinth</b> fishes, gouramis have <b>a</b> lung-like <b>labyrinth</b> organ {{that allows them to}} gulp air and use atmospheric oxygen. This organ is a vital innovation for fishes that often inhabit warm, shallow, oxygen-poor water.|$|R
50|$|There {{are more}} than 20 mi of hiking trails, a lodge, rustic guest cabins, tent {{platforms}} (in summer), <b>a</b> meditative <b>labyrinth,</b> <b>a</b> sanctuary, a gift shop, and a conference center. Guest services are available.|$|R
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) consisted of <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched {{from the mountain}} passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{is set in}} {{the game}} world of the Dead or Alive series. Located mainly in Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire, the game draws on Heian period {{structures}} for its Japanese locales—a ninja fortress and village set in the mountains. In contrast the Vigoor Empire, with its capital city of Tairon, is a blend of architectural types from around the world. European-style buildings display Arabic lettering, and the monastery in Tairon exhibits Gothic influences with a vaulted hall, pointed arches, and large stained glass windows. A hidden underground level features statues with the heads of cats, walls covered with carvings, hieroglyphics, Aztec pyramid and <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth.</b> This mix of styles was the result of Itagaki's deliberate refusal to constrain the game's creative process.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

5|$|In Little Busters! Ecstasy, adult {{elements}} {{were added to}} the gameplay in the form of sexual CGs depicting Riki and a given heroine having sex. Ecstasy extends the story for the scenarios of the heroines in Little Busters!, as well as increasing the number of heroine routes from six to nine. These three heroine routes include scenarios for Kanata Futaki and Sasami Sasasegawa—two supporting characters from Little Busters!—and a new heroine named Saya Tokido who is only featured in Ecstasy. The first time the game is played, these three heroine routes are unavailable to the player until after the Refrain scenario is completed, though the player is given the option to make them immediately available. Ecstasy has several minor additions and changes to the minigames as well, including the addition of weapons available for use in the battle sequences. Also, Ecstasy features the addition of two recurring minigames related to Saya: a shooting game with pistols and navigating <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E
5|$|Prototype {{released}} a PlayStation 2 (PS2) port of Ecstasy titled Little Busters! Converted Edition on December 24, 2009, which removed the adult {{elements of the}} game. The PS2 version was available to try at Key 10th Memorial Fes, an event held in commemoration of Key's ten-year anniversary between February 28 and March 1, 2009. A PlayStation Portable (PSP) version of Little Busters! Converted Edition, also by Prototype, was released on November 25, 2010. The Windows and PS2 versions had voice acting for only the major characters, but the PSP version contained full voice acting {{for all of the}} characters other than Riki. Prototype also {{released a}} version of Little Busters! Converted Edition ported to the PlayStation Vita (PS Vita) on March 22, 2012. Along with also having full voice acting, the PS Vita version contains 1.4x larger CGs than the Windows edition, and the limited edition came bundled with a drama CD. Prototype released a PlayStation 3 (PS3) version of Converted Edition with the additional content included in the previous consumer ports on March 20, 2013. An added feature in the PS3 version is a 3D rendering of the minigame in Saya's route where the player must navigate <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth.</b> A downloadable version of the PS3 release via the PlayStation Store was released by Prototype on May 29, 2013.|$|E

25|$|All this {{tends to}} characterise “L’Adone” as <b>a</b> <b>labyrinth</b> of {{entangled}} situations without any real structure. The lengthy Canto XX, {{which takes place}} after the protagonist's death, serves to undermine any pretence to narrative unity. But this very lack of unity constitutes Marino's narrative innovation. The poet composes his work using various levels and passes from one episode to the next without any apparent logical connection, basing the links solely on a language rich in hyperboles, antitheses and metaphors.|$|E
