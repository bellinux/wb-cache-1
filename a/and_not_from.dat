5|$|In 2014, {{analysis}} of Titan's atmospheric nitrogen {{suggested that it}} has possibly been sourced from material similar to that found in the Oort cloud <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> sources present during co-accretion of materials around Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Keeler was {{responsible}} for the restoration of Baltimore's Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, America's first cathedral. The project cost approximately $32 million. The funds were raised entirely from private donations <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the Archdiocese's treasury. It lasted from 2004 until November 2006, and was finished in time for a celebration honoring the 200th anniversary of the groundbreaking. By the time the restoration was completed, the Basilica had been repaired and restored to its more original appearance.|$|E

5|$|On 6 June 2013, {{scientists}} at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life.

5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac {{at a meeting}} at the western edge of Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands in what is now Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
5|$|According to latter {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army. In this version, Kali {{is described as a}} Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas in herself and says that they are her different forms. In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
5|$|For its fiftieth anniversary, Fantasia {{returned}} to 550 theaters nationwide on October 5, 1990, in its traditional 1946 version including the live action scenes with Taylor {{and the original}} Stokowski score. The film underwent a two-year restoration process which began after a six-month search {{to piece together the}} original negatives that had been in storage since 1946. This marked the first time since then that a release of the film had been processed from the original <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> a copy. Each of its 535,680 frames were restored at YCM Laboratories, and an untouched print from 1951 was used for guidance on color and tone. Theaters were required to have specific stereo equipment installed, and to present the film in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio with black borders on the side of their screens. The Stokowski soundtrack was digitally remastered using the 1955 magnetic soundtrack, with an estimated three thousand pops and hisses being removed in the process. The 1990 reissue of Fantasia went on to gross $25 million domestically.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the Saturnian system of Titan, mid-sized moons, and rings {{developed}} from a set-up closer to the Galilean moons of Jupiter, though the details are unclear. It has been proposed either that a second Titan-sized moon broke up, producing the rings and inner mid-sized moons, or that two large moons fused to form Titan, with the collision scattering icy debris that formed the mid-sized moons. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. Studies based on Enceladus's tidal-based geologic activity {{and the lack of}} evidence of extensive past resonances in Tethys, Dione, and Rhea's orbits suggest that the moons inward of Titan may be only 100 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E

5|$|The sad elephant, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} the elephant in the room, is a large elephant with a tear dropping from its eye. It spans four rooms near the Space Station area of Dimension VVVVVV, flickering constantly from color to color. If the player stands near the elephant {{for a short period}} of time, it will cause Captain Viridian to become sad. The elephant serves no function to the game, but has served to provoke much discussion about its meaning or symbolism amongst fans of the game. Similarly to many of the enemies in the game, the sad elephant originated in dream journals kept by creator Terry Cavanagh <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> Jet Set Willy as once believed.|$|E
5|$|When BSP workers garlanded Mayawati with {{currency}} {{notes on the}} occasion of the party's silver jubilee celebrations coinciding with BSP founder Kanshi Ram’s birth anniversary on March 15, 2010, Indian news channels and newspapers purported to expose the event as a ‘scandal’ on the presumption that the Chief Minister had publicly committed an act of corruption that was being flaunted openly and declaring that the garland of {{currency notes}} was made from money through corrupt means <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> donations of Bahujan Samaj Party supporters as Mayawati, her Ministers and supporters claimed.|$|E
5|$|While {{crossing}} Cuba, Lili primarily caused {{damage from}} its heavy rainfall <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the winds. Nationwide, Lili damaged 92,542houses and destroyed another 6,369, mostly in Cienfuegos and Sancti Spíritus, which left {{thousands of people}} homeless. Heavy rains caused homes to collapse along the path, many already in poor condition. On Isla de la Juventud, the winds damaged 85houses and destroyed another 103. The winds also stripped 16tons of grapefruit from their trees on the island. Nationwide, {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees fell during the storm. On Cayo Largo del Sur, the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas. In Villa Clara Province, about 45mi (75km) of roads were damaged, and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28sugar refineries. In Havana, the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees. Nationwide, the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines, leaving many towns without power, and power plants were damaged in Sancti Spíritus and Cienfuegos provinces. The hurricane also damaged 21hospitals and dozens of health clinics, along with 32schools. Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm's path, affecting thousands of hectares of arable land, and damaging 105agricultural facilities. Flooding affected the banana, fruit, coffee, sugar cane, and rice crops. Nationwide, the storm damaged about 25,406hectares of bananas and 686,893hectares of sugar cane, along with 36,249hectares of other crops. In Sancti Espíritu, 28,000tons of rice were wrecked, and in Matanzas, 7,500tons of citrus crops were heavily damaged. Total damages in the country were estimated at $362million (1996 USD). There were no deaths in Cuba, and seven injuries.|$|E
