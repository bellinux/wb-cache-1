5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E

5|$|In May 1798, a large French {{fleet of}} {{warships}} and transports crossed the Mediterranean Sea with {{an army of}} more than 35,000 men under General Napoleon Bonaparte, intent on an invasion of Egypt, then nominally held by the neutral Ottoman Empire. Pausing to capture Malta, the French force then pressed on eastwards aware that a fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson had entered the Mediterranean and was in pursuit. Successfully avoiding Nelson's forces, the fleet reached Alexandria on 29 June and immediately invaded, rapidly advancing inland and defeating the Mamluk rulers of Egypt at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July. While the army had pushed inland, the fleet, under Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers, had anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria, and was found there in the afternoon of 1 August by Nelson's fleet. Despite the growing darkness, Nelson attacked at once and in the three-day Battle of the Nile destroyed or captured eleven ships {{of the line and}} two frigates. Just two ships of the line and two frigates escaped and <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3,000 casualties was Admiral Brueys, killed on his flagship Orient.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Japanese {{consumer}} electronics firms forged {{ahead with the}} development of HDTV technology, and the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese company, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard—based on an analog system—was the front-runner <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.|$|E

The star is among the Aries constellation. Coincidentally, it matched the debut date of Shinhwa which falls on March 24, 1998. The star Shinhwa is the brightest <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2 thousand stars with Korean names {{that can be seen}} with the naked eye. The star is best seen in November.

25|$|There is {{overlap between}} the sayings of Jesus in the {{apocryphal}} texts and canonical Christian writings, and those {{not present in}} the canonical texts are called agrapha. There are at least 225 agrapha but most scholars who have studied them have drawn negative conclusions about the authenticity of most of them and see little value in using them for historical Jesus research. Robert Van Voorst states {{that the vast majority}} of the agrapha are certainly inauthentic. Scholars differ on the number of authentic agrapha, some estimating as low as seven as authentic, others as high as 18 <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 200, rendering them of little value altogether. While research on apocryphal texts continues, the general scholarly opinion holds that they have little to offer to the study of the historicity of Jesus given that they are often of uncertain origin, and almost always later documents of lower value.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 16 April, the main roads were blocked by Croat troops. According to several {{international}} observers, the attack occurred from three sides and was designed to force the fleeing population towards the south where elite marksmen with particularly sophisticated weapons shot those escaping. Other troops, organised in small groups of about five to ten soldiers, went {{from house to house}} setting them on fire and killing the residents. Around one hundred soldiers took part in the operation. The attack resulted in the massacre of the Bosniak villagers and the destruction of the village. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 who died were 32 women and 11 {{children under the age of}} 18.

25|$|In the past, WFAA {{has also}} chosen to {{pre-empt}} certain ABC programs because of content deemed inappropriate by station management, {{in some cases}} due to concerns over possible FCC-imposed fines. Under the stewardship of general manager Mike Shapiro during the 1960s and 1970s, WFAA pre-empted certain theatrical and made-for-television films aired by ABC which management deemed too risque for broadcast. WFAA was the largest ABC affiliate to pre-empt NYPD Blue (which had its first two seasons air on independent station-turned-UPN affiliate KTXA instead) due to concerns over its violent content, and occasional strong profanity and partial nudity. Channel 8 substituted the police procedural in its Tuesday night timeslot with alternate programming, before launching Good Evening Texas—a weekly talk show serving {{as an extension of}} Good Morning Texas—in September 1994; WFAA began clearing NYPD Blue at the start of its third season in September 1995. It was also <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 ABC-affiliated stations that declined to air the network's telecast of Saving Private Ryan in November 2004, due to concerns over possible fines over the intense war violence and strong profanity in the film that ABC opted against editing out of the broadcast amid the FCC's crackdown on indecent material following the wardrobe malfunction incident that occurred during Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show performance that February; the FCC declared the film's telecast as not being in violation of the agency's broadcast decency regulations after it aired.|$|E
