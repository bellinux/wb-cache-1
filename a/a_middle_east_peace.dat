30|$|The primary {{benefit of}} the AHP as <b>a</b> tool for <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> negotiators, whether used {{internally}} or together between the parties, is to reduce uncertainties—between and among the parties—on the relative value of core issues as negotiators address the “trade-off/exchange” component of negotiations.

50|$|The Soviet Union {{used its}} disenfranchisement of European Imperialism to gain {{economic}} {{cooperation with the}} Arab World during the Cold War and their influence in the <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> by inciting proxy conflicts between the Arab states, and their Jewish neighbors.

50|$|After the {{initiators}} {{had believed}} for some days end of March and beginning of April that the Syrian government {{was willing to}} comply with the peace plan, new signs of war and statements of politicians gradually cast discouraging shadows over those hopes. By the first of May 2012, the UN had to admit that the peace plan was in dire straits. Heavy government violence on 25 May, and the promise of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) on 1 June to resume its ‘defensive operations’, made clear that this peace initiative had, for the time being, run aground. Several new peace initiatives would follow, recently the attempt in 2012-2013 at <b>a</b> Geneva II <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> conference and the Russian initiative in November 2013 for(peace) talks in Moscow.|$|R
5000|$|In The Sum of All Fears, Ryan reaches his highest {{post at the}} CIA, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. His {{career is}} jeopardized when Fowler becomes President and Elizabeth Elliott, Fowler's lover/manipulator, becomes National Security Advisor. They not only deny Ryan any credit for <b>an</b> {{innovative}} <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> <b>peace</b> plan (basically turning Jerusalem into a Vatican-like city co-ruled by three Christian, Jewish, and Arab mayors), but also panic when Iranian and former East German terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb in Denver during the Super Bowl and nearly plunge the world into a Soviet-American nuclear war. Ryan defuses the nuclear crisis by commandeering the Washington-Moscow hot line and convincing the Soviet Premier (through his friend Golovko) that the crisis is a setup. He then refuses to confirm Fowler's order to launch a nuclear missile at Qom (thus preventing the attack), where the Iranian ayatollah lives. The crisis and Elliot scandal drive Fowler to resign (with Elliot arrested), and on this note, Ryan retires from the CIA after his CIA friends and he fly to Riyadh and witness {{the execution of the}} terrorists, then being honored by the U.S.'s Middle Eastern allies. (The film version again departs from the printed version, by presenting a younger, unmarried Ryan, an intelligent mistress-free Fowler, a Greer-like Cabot, and the nuclear bomb is detonated in Baltimore, not Denver.) ...|$|R
