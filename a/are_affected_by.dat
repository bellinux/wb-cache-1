5|$|All {{observation}} involves both {{perception and}} cognition. That is, {{one does not}} make an observation passively, but rather is actively engaged in distinguishing the phenomenon being observed from surrounding sensory data. Therefore, observations <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> one's underlying understanding {{of the way in}} which the world functions, and that understanding may influence what is perceived, noticed, or deemed worthy of consideration. In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, more {{is known about}} the habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{the effects}} of common types of noise on verbal and spatial information processing are still relatively unknown. Three experiments, using convenience sampling were conducted to investigate the effect of auditory interference on the cognitive performance of 24 adult men and women during the Stroop test, perception of object recognition and spatial location tasks, {{and the perception of}} object size, shape, and spatial location tasks. The data were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and 1 -way multivariate analysis of variance. The Experiment 1 findings indicated reaction time performance for gender and age group <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between experimental conditions, and recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> only <b>by</b> experimental condition. The Experiment 2 a results showed reaction time performance for recognizing object features <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups, and recognition accuracy by experimental condition. The Experiment 2 b results demonstrated reaction time performance for detecting the spatial location of objects <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. In addition, reaction time <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the type of interference and spatial location. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition and spatial location. The Experiment 3 findings suggested reaction time performance for assessing part-whole relationships <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. Further, recognition accuracy <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> interference condition between experimental groups.

5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} <b>are</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> {{schizophrenia}} during their lifetimes. In 2013 {{there were an}} estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma.
