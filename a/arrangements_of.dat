In May 1944 he conducted the Boyd Neel string orchestra, Dennis Brain and Pears in the first recording of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, which has frequently been reissued, most recently on CD.|$|E

5|$|After several {{conflicts}} with the school's administration, Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the Theological College in Tyvriv. Besides working with the college choir, Leontovych organized an amateur orchestra that often performed at college events. As he did earlier with choirs, Leontovych included <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> folk songs among the usual religious works sung in theological schools. These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko, his own choral <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> folk songs, and entirely original works. One such work {{was based on a}} poem by Taras Shevchenko titled “Зоре моя вечірняя” (Oh my evening star).|$|E

5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> Liszt's symphonic poems would become an important feature of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E

He did not wholly abandon {{composition}} in these years. He made large-scale symphonic <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> works by Bach and Handel and wrote his Empire March and eight songs Pageant of Empire for the 1924 British Empire Exhibition.

5|$|After Von Laue's {{pioneering}} research, {{the field}} developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg {{and his father}} William Henry Bragg. In 1912–1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from evenly spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two- and three-dimensional <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> atoms in the unit-cell.|$|E

5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
