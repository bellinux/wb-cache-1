40|$|Objective: This study {{focuses on}} {{cooperation}} between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> aspects of that cooperation {{that can provide}} leads for interventions aimed at enhancing hospital performance. - Design: We performed a qualitative study on cooperation between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> the influence of that cooperation on hospital performance, and structured the resulting data according to the conditions of Allport's theory on intergroup conflicts. - Setting: General hospitals in the Netherlands. - Participants: Thirty physicians (surgical <b>and</b> internal) <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> (strategic, tactic <b>and</b> operational) working in five different hospitals. - Interventions: In-depth interviews exploring the influence of cooperation between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> on hospital performance. - Main Outcome Measures: Respondents confirmed {{the complexity of the}} relationship between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> the link between their cooperation and hospital performance. Mentioned aspects such as power and status differences, clarity in decision-making and personal click, are important in determining the effectiveness of the cooperation between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers.</b> - Results: Our study suggests that the effectiveness of cooperation between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is related to the uptake of quality initiatives and hospital performance. - Conclusions: The complex relationship between physicians <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> can be referred to as an intergroup conflict situation. We combined Allport's Contact theory conditions with aspects found in our study leading to the following facilitating conditions: address common goals; create interdependent tasks; arrange the support of authorities and respect the medical domain. They will enhance intra-hospital cooperation and therewith hospital performance...|$|R

40|$|The Finance Industry is an {{important}} aspect of the economy including banking, credit, securities and insurance activities. It offers many well-paying jobs, and is expected to see growth in the coming years. This report examines the Finance Industry with respect to the employment of women, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and American Indians /Alaskan Natives. Of particular interest is the status of these groups in management positions. EEO- 1 data is utilized to examine the subsectors of the Finance Industry. • The percentage of women officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is highest in the Banking/Credit subsector (48. 6 percent) and their lowest percentage is in the Securities subsector (33. 8 percent). The percentage of women officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> in each of the subsectors falls below the percentage of women employed as professionals, which might be considered a source for management jobs. • Similar disparities between the percentage of African American officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> <b>and</b> the percentage of African American professionals are also observed. Among the Financial Industry subsectors, the percentage of African American officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is highest in the Banking/Credit subsector (7. 0 percent) and lowest in the Securities subsector (4. 4 percent). • The percentage of Hispanic officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is highest in the Central Banking subsector (5. 1 percent) and lowest in the Securities subsector (2. 9 percent). In all subsectors, the percentage of Hispanic officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is less that the percentage of Hispanic professionals. • The highest percentage of Asian officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is in the Securities subsector (6. 4 percent) and the lowest percentage of Asian officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is in Central Banking and Insurance (2. 8 percent). Like the other groups examined, the percentage of Asian officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> falls below the percentage of Asian professionals in each subsector. • Employment as officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> is examined in more detail for each of these groups by determining their chance of being officials <b>and</b> <b>managers</b> in contrast to professionals and sales workers. This shows that each subsector has a large portion of establishments where such chances are unfavorable to women, African Americans, Hispanics and Asians when compared to white males. Entry into management may be a particular concern for Asians. • While the relative chance of being an official or manager is better in the Securities subsector for each of the groups analyzed, the low proportion of women and African American professionals in this subsector may be partly responsible for these results...|$|R
