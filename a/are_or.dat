5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they <b>are,</b> <b>or</b> die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments <b>are</b> <b>or</b> should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

Among the methods that <b>are</b> <b>or</b> {{have been used}} are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E

5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they <b>are</b> <b>or</b> how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{series is}} mainly {{based on the}} short stories and manga which preceded it. The anime focuses on Nagisa Aoi and, to a {{slightly}} lesser extent, Hikari Konohana, and the three girls that they each <b>are</b> <b>or</b> become close to at their respective schools; some admire them or wish to be their friend, and others are vying for their affections. Of particular focus are the romantic relationships between Nagisa and Shizuma Hanazono and between Hikari and Amane Ōtori. The series culminates in {{the election of the}} new Etoile pairing, although this aspect of the story is downplayed compared to the manga. Fan service, or giving appealing visuals of the girls nude or in provocative situations, is seen in the anime, but only briefly.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar {{freshwater}} and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that <b>are</b> <b>or</b> were tentatively identified with H. polylepis. The Australian freshwater Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The freshwater Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of freshwater whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences. Finally, {{additional research is needed}} to assess the degree of divergence amongst populations of H. polylepis inhabiting various drainage basins across its distribution, so as to determine whether further taxonomic differentiation is warranted.|$|E
5|$|State {{routes in}} Delaware are {{signed with the}} MUTCD default {{circular}} route marker, which consists of black numbers in a white circle on a rectangular black background. These routes are largely assigned in a pattern similar to the Interstate and U.S. routes. Odd-numbered routes generally run north-south and even-numbered routes generally run east-west. A grid pattern exists for several low-numbered east-west state routes that increases from north to south, starting with DE 2 in northern Delaware and continuing south to DE 30 {{in the southern part}} of the state. There is also a pattern for some low-numbered north-south routes beginning with DE 1 in the east and continuing to DE 11 in the west. Several routes in Delaware are numbered as continuations of Maryland and Pennsylvania state routes, without regard to the even/odd pattern. Examples include DE 52, which is a southern continuation of PA 52, and DE 273, which is an eastern continuation of MD 273. DE 48 was once connected to Route 48 in New Jersey by a ferry across the Delaware River. Most of the 3-digit state routes <b>are</b> <b>or</b> were continuations of routes from Maryland and Pennsylvania, with the exception of DE 141 and DE 202. The lowest numbered state route is DE 1, while the highest numbered route is DE 896.|$|E
