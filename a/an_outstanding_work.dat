500|$|Reflecting on {{the life}} of John Belushi for a 2012 article, WOMC placed the sketch among those {{regarded}} as the most well-remembered and loved performances by the actor. In his 2012 book Star Trek: The Complete Unauthorized History, author Robert Greenberger called the piece a classic. In a September 2013 article for The A.V. Club, Phil Dyess-Nugent described [...] "The Last Voyage Of The Starship Enterprise" [...] as lovable in-depth satire of Star Trek with a touching impression of Shatner that was likely the best routine from the first year of Saturday Night Live. In a subsequent review of the episode in an October 2013, Dyess-Nugent again praised the sketch, writing that it was <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>work</b> both as a form of humor and a tribute to Star Trek fans.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the film's release, Literaturnaya Gazeta {{published}} a column by [...] in which he described the film as [...] "wonderful... a truthful portrayal of the relations between the people and the leader... and the love of all people to Stalin." [...] A day after, Vsevolod Pudovkin wrote in Soviet Art: [...] "this is <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>work</b> of Soviet cinema" [...] that presented [...] "in profound depth and in vast scale... a bold, creative representation of the subject... a lively demonstration of the ever developing genre of Socialist Realism." [...] The picture was enthusiastically promoted by the Soviet press. A series of articles in Pravda praised it as an authentic representation of history.|$|E
2500|$|When British author Ian Watson read Bishop's A Little Knowledge (1977), {{he was so}} {{fascinated with}} the alien Cygnusians that he wrote to inquire whether Bishop had plans {{to write a story}} about the aliens' home planet. [...] Thus began what Bishop calls [...] "the first ever [...] science fiction collaboration", with all {{correspondence}} sent by post. [...] Although often labeled as the third book in the series, it is not truly part of the main UrNu sequence. In this novel, published in the UK by Gollancz (1981) and in the US by Ace Books (1982), a Japanese linguist, crewmember of the research starship Heavensbridge, arrives on the home planet of the Kybers (so-called because they're seemingly made of flesh and metal.) [...] She soon learns that the planet's sun will shortly go nova. [...] Brian Stableford writes that the novel when compared with other recent sf collaborations [...] "is a very solid and rewarding piece of work. [...] Its basic premise is original and intelligently worked-out, and the storyline sustains the fascination of the reader throughout. [...] Nevertheless, it seems to me to fall slightly behind the standard set by recent solo works by either of the two authors." [...] He concludes that the [...] "book is worth reading, but it is not <b>an</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>work</b> in either author's canon." [...] This is Michael Bishop's last novel-length work of other worlds fiction.|$|E
