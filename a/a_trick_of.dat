5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail had a {{positive}} reception from music critics, who were impressed that the group could not only survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums {{as a result of}} Hentschel's production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Gawain {{leaves for}} the Green Chapel with the girdle wound twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

Nearly one-third of the 1300 assembled delegates signed a petition calling for Debs that Stedman circulated. His effort was short-circuited by <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> the supporters of William Jennings Bryan, however, when the gas lights were shut out on the convention. The following day a statement by Debs was read to the convention indicating that he had no desire to run for president and the bid was over, leaving Stedman to support Bryan in the 1896 campaign.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail was {{released}} in February 1976 and was a commercial and critical success for the band. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. The title track {{was released}} as a single, though it did not chart. In June, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Institute for selling over 100,000 copies which helped the band clear the £400,000 of debt (equivalent to £ in [...] ). they owed when Gabriel left. For {{the first time in}} their career Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs, including [...] "A Trick of the Tail" [...] and [...] "Robbery, Assault and Battery". Before the upcoming tour, Collins sought a drummer he felt comfortable about playing drums while he sang; he chose Bill Bruford who offered to do the job. From March to July 1976, Genesis performed across North America and Europe with the <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail tour, to enthusiastic crowds. Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, which was successful. The shows in Glasgow and Stafford were filmed for their concert film , released in cinemas in February 1977 as a double bill with White Rock.|$|E
500|$|Members of the {{original}} line-up were exposed to classical and church music as well as rock artists of the 1960s, particularly the Beatles. Gabriel's vocal style was influenced by Otis Redding and other Stax artists. In their early years, Genesis' music combined elements of the pop, folk, and psychedelic genres. Several songs developed during Phillips' time in the band originated on 12-string guitars, often with unconventional tunings. By the 1970s, the group began to include fantasy and surreal elements in their lyrics, such as [...] "The Musical Box". Nursery Cryme {{marks the first time}} electric instruments were used more extensively. <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail marked a return to the band's roots with acoustic passages and songs inspired by fantasy.|$|E
500|$|There are two German {{statues of}} saints in wood, about half life-size, from the decades around 1500, {{and a larger}} number of {{miniature}} boxwood carvings. [...] These include [...] "prayer nuts" [...] of superb quality from around 1510 to 1530. These are small wooden [...] "balls" [...] which open up to reveal carvings of religious scenes that fit dozens of tiny figures into a space two or three inches across, and were a fashion among royalty and the wealthy; they were apparently made in the northern Netherlands. [...] They seem to have often been suspended from belts, or formed part of a rosary; others still have copper carrying cases. [...] <b>A</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> technique in making them is that the main carved scene is made on a smaller hemisphere, allowing access from behind, which was then set into the main hemisphere.|$|E

500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find out just how good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{does not}} believe this <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> the eye {{resulting}} from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead he {{sees it as a}} subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the Book of Genesis' Tree of life, which he describes here as [...] "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge the subtlety of the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting {{from the top of the}} cross may have been borrowed from Masaccio's c.1426 Crucifixion, where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and [...] "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".|$|E
500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{search for a}} replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with [...] "Follow You Follow Me" [...] and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached No. 1 in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [...] in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary [...] in 2014.|$|E

500|$|Following the Lamb tour, Hackett {{recorded}} his first solo album Voyage of the Acolyte {{as he felt}} unsure that Genesis would survive following Gabriel's departure. He reconvened with the remaining group members in London in July 1975. Collins' idea of continuing as an instrumental group was quickly rejected by the group as {{they thought it would}} become boring. Rehearsals for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail took place in Acton where material was quickly written and with little effort; most of [...] "Dance on a Volcano" [...] and [...] "Squonk" [...] was put together in the first three days. Recording began in October 1975 at Trident Studios with Hentschel as producer. As a replacement singer had not been found, the band decided to record the album without vocals and audition singers as they went. They placed an anonymous advertisement in Melody Maker for [...] "a singer for a Genesis-type group" [...] which received around 400 replies. Collins proceeded to teach selected applicants the songs; Mick Strickland was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range and the band decided not to work with him. Having failed to find a suitable vocalist, Collins went in the studio and attempted to sing [...] "Squonk". His performance was well received by the band, and they decided that he should be their new lead vocalist. Collins then sang on the remaining tracks.|$|E
500|$|In September 1976, Genesis {{relocated}} to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands with Hentschel to record Wind & Wuthering. It {{was put together}} in {{a short amount of}} time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development. Rutherford spoke of the band's conscious effort to distance themselves from songs inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums [...] "were full of". The band spent roughly six weeks writing the album with a basic form of each track put down in twelve days. Additional recording and production work was done at Trident Studios that October. Hackett, having already released a solo album, enjoyed the greater amount of control over the recording process that working within a group could not provide. He felt his songs, including [...] "Please Don't Touch" [...] which he later released on his second album Please Don't Touch!, were rejected from the final track order in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Collins spoke of the situation, [...] "We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it". Wind & Wuthering was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 the UK and No. 26 in the US. Rutherford's track, [...] "Your Own Special Way", became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK. Its B-side is [...] "It's Yourself", originally intended for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail.|$|E

2500|$|Hackett reconvened with Genesis in mid-1975 {{to write}} and rehearse for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail (1976), their first with Collins on lead vocals after no other singer could be found. Hackett joined the writing {{sessions}} for the album late due to working on Voyage of the Acolyte, and was low on musical ideas but is credited on [...] "Dance on a Volcano", [...] "Entangled", and [...] "Los Endos". He began to feel frustrated over the group's more democratic approach to songwriting and selecting material for their albums.|$|E
2500|$|Elbow {{have cited}} {{a number of}} {{influences}} on their music, including Genesis (in particular the progressive rock years featuring Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett), Talk Talk and Radiohead. Guy Garvey has said: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} every Genesis record. I learned to write harmonies by listening to Peter Gabriel." [...] The song [...] "Newborn" [...] from Elbow's debut album was directly influenced by [...] "Entangled" [...] from the Genesis album <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> the Tail. Garvey has also said [...] "there'd be no Elbow without Radiohead". He credits the band's sense of dynamics to the influence of Talk Talk and has said: [...] "Volume dynamics are an essential part of classical music, but a lost art with guitar music. I think it's incredibly boring and shortsighted if a band sticks with just one sound song for song. An album should take people on a journey." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronsard's {{period of}} study {{occupied}} seven years, and the first manifesto of the new literary movement, which was {{to apply to the}} vernacular the principles of criticism and scholarship learnt from the classics, came not from him but from Du Bellay. The Défense et illustration de la langue française of the latter appeared in 1549, and the Pléiade (or Brigade, as it was first called) may be said to have been then launched. It consisted, as its name implies, of seven writers whose names are sometimes differently enumerated, though the orthodox canon is beyond doubt composed of Ronsard, Du Bellay, Baïf, Remy Belleau, Pontus de Tyard (a man of rank and position who had exemplified the principles of the friends earlier), Jodelle the dramatist, and Daurat. Ronsard's own work came a little later, and a rather idle story is told of <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> Du Bellay's which at last determined him to publish. Some single and minor pieces, an epithalamium on Antoine de Bourbon and Jeanne de Navarre (1550), a [...] "Hymne de la France" [...] (1549), an [...] "Ode a la Paix," [...] preceded the publication in 1550 of the four first books ("first" [...] is characteristic and noteworthy) of the Odes of Pierre de Ronsard.|$|E
