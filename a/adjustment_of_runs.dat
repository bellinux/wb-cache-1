40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> selective attention following errors and {{their relation to}} the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), a correlate of errors in event-related potentials. We hypothesized that, if post-error adjustments reflect an adaptive mechanism that should prevent the occurrence of further errors, then <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> attentional selectivity should be observed only following errors due to insufficient selective attention. To test this, a four-choice flanker task was used in which errors due to insufficient selective attention (flanker errors) and other errors (nonflanker errors) could be distinguished. We found strong <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> selective attention following flanker errors but not following nonflanker errors.

The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine whether more conflict triggers more <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> cognitive control for subsequent performance. To this end, we focussed on the bivalency effect, that is, the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> cognitive control following the conflict induced by bivalent stimuli (i. e., stimuli with relevant features for two tasks). In two experiments, we tested whether the amount of conflict triggered by bivalent stimuli affected the bivalency effect. Bivalent stimuli were either compatible (i. e., affording one response) or incompatible (i. e., affording two different responses). Thus, compatible bivalent stimuli involved a task conflict, whereas incompatible bivalent stimuli involved a task and a response conflict. The results showed that the bivalency effect was not affected by this manipulation. This indicates that more conflict does not trigger more <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> cognitive control for subsequent performance. Therefore, only the occurrence of conflict – not its amount – is determinant for cognitive contro...|$|R
