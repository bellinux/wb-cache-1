5|$|Bobby Robson's {{appointment}} {{followed a}} chance encounter with Ipswich director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton.

Robson led the club to fourth place in the First Division <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> the Texaco Cup, beating local rivals Norwich City 4–2, in the 1972–73 season.|$|E
5|$|Game critics praised Giants for {{state-of-the-art}} graphics, humorous story, <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> blending in one genre with another. Criticisms of {{the game}} centered on crippling software bugs and lack of an in-game save feature. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, {{at the cost of}} removing several features. Giants sold poorly initially for both Windows and PlayStation2; however, it sold well afterwards and the game has gained a cult following.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine Fencing Committee {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in organizing {{a team to}} attend the 1924 Summer Olympics. Despite {{the establishment of the}} Argentine Olympic Committee, and his participation <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> all of the trials, Camet did not attend a congratulatory gala for the Olympic delegation, nor did he travel to Paris to participate in the games themselves, for personal reasons. The official report lists him {{as a member of the}} official delegation, albeit one who did not participate. That year, the Argentines placed fifth in the team foil competition. He continued to practice fencing until 1926 when, after winning a national championship, he put the sport on hold to complete his law degree.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM {{began as}} an {{underground}} phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds campaigning that it reached the public consciousness and gained radio airplay, recognition <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered {{the progress of the}} heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} was first shown in public in 1882, at the Vienna Academy's annual student exhibition, which exhibited works produced during the 1881–82 academic year. It was well received by art critics and Jovanović's peers, who judged {{it to be}} the exhibition's finest work and bestowed him the first-place prize. Jovanović also received an Austro-Hungarian government scholarship. The exact amount accorded to the artist is disputed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, writes that the scholarship amounted to 300 florins. Art historians Radmila Antić and Nikola Kusovac state the scholarship amounted to 1,000 florins. Jovanović's triumph at the student exhibition and the subsequent scholarship gave him the means to travel over the summer holidays, during which he came up with a number of ideas for future paintings, such as The Fencing Lesson (Mačevanje). Winning the Vienna Academy prize established him as a respected painter of Orientalist works and set the stage for further recognition <b>and</b> <b>success.</b> <b>In</b> 1883, Jovanović entered into a contract with Ernest Gambart's French Gallery in London to produce a series of paintings on Balkan life. This contract assured him lifelong financial security.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} to Ipswich Town in 1969 {{and it was there}} that he {{established}} his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division <b>and</b> <b>success</b> <b>in</b> the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977–78 season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal] in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5–4 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold Mühren. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, with his good interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best.|$|E
