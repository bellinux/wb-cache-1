40|$|AbstractThe jet mixing <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> is a {{new kind}} of {{supporting}} technology for foundation pit engineering in soft clay. The engineering features of jet mixing <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> as well as the difference between it and normal anchor bolt are introduced. The uplift tests of 4 jet mixing anchor piles are presented in detail to obtain the ultimate bearing capacity and load–deformation relationship of the piles. Load-transfer analysis, which is rarely applied in the analysis of uplift piles, is carried out on the piles with a hyperbolic calculation model. The load transfer method focuses on the interface between pile and soil, with which the non-linear behavior, the bearing capacity and the engineering features of the anchor piles can be fully studied. The calculated load–displacement curves of the piles have close agreement with that of the pullout tests, indicating that the proposed analytical solution is reasonable and feasible in predicting the bearing capacity of the piles. Thus, with this study, the supporting stiffness of the <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> can be predicted in the design stage of the foundation pit engineering, which is very important and meaningful in practical engineering. The decay curve of shear stress of soil surrounding the pile is derived with the load-transfer method, through which the minimum transverse space of each two piles can be decided against the pile group effect. Engineers can optimize the length and spacing of group piles through this...|$|E

In {{the introductory part of}} the thesis, the location of the slide and the damage it caused to the road surface and the nearby area are presented. Presentation of the landslide remediation which had already been carried out and which presented the grounds for the remedial practices used for the analyses presented in the thesis is also included in the introductory part. In continuation, basic characteristics of the area and its soil, gained through the use of boreholes and standard penetration testing, are presented. On the basis of gained data, back analysis, the aim of which is to gather detailed characteristics of the soil in the area prior to the slide, is carried out. The analysis is carried out {{with the use of the}} Slide 5. 0 programme and examines three possible cases affecting the original slope stability and therefore causing a slide: low water level and weak soil characteristics, high water level and good soil characteristics and artesian water and good soil characteristics. Data gained from the analysis were used for the dimensioning of remedial measures which envisage stabilisation of the upper part of the slide with the use of a packed rockfill, while the bottom with the use of a pile wall. The latter is either an <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> wall system or an embedded pile wall system. Optimisation of individual supporting systems' dimensions was carried out in accordance with the Eurocode 7 standard. In the concluding parts of the thesis, a comparison of the packed rockfill, <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> wall and embedded pile wall dimensions and important characteristics is presented with a purpose to provide a more clear understanding of the contributing factors causing a slide, as well as their impact on the constructions' dimensions. ...|$|E

Through {{simulating}} {{interaction between}} pile and foundation soil after establishing surface-surface contact element with {{finite element method}} and ANSYS software, the load resistance performance and ultimate strength of the ground <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> working for a workover derrick are achieved. In winter, frozen soil depth can be up to 2 meters in north china. When temperature rises in spring, the Polar grassland changes by three stages, namely, frozen, freeze thawing and melted. But for the large temperature difference between morning and evening, {{the state of the}} soil layer is extremely unstable which greatly affect the carrying capacity of anchor piles.

The {{results showed that the}} <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> have a steeper behavior than the rested piles and the floating piles. Increasing the depth of the piles can induce a considerable increase of the soil contact surface. Therefore, there is an increase of the soil mass that participates in the vibratory movement. The results show that the <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> in the rigid layer give the best solution; therefore, the <b>anchoring</b> of the <b>piles</b> is not a negligible factor in the case of deep foundations.|$|R
30|$|Figures  6, 7 and 8 {{show the}} {{influence}} of the support layer rigidity on one hand and {{the influence of}} the fixing conditions on the other hand for different value of the s/d ratio. Fixing the piles on the support layer increases the dynamic rigidity of the soil–pile–slab system especially for the ratios s/d[*]=[*] 2 and 10 (Figs.  6 and 8). For the three s/d ratios, the dynamic rigidity of the <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> is greater than the ones of the rested piles. The latter is superior to the ones of the floating piles. The vertical dynamic impedance for the <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> case is two times the one of the floating piles one for the ratio s/s[*]=[*] 2 – 10. The effect of the support layer on the damping is not negligible. The presence of a rigid layer induces a reduction of the damping especially for high s/d ratios and frequency (Fig.  8). The obtained results show that <b>anchoring</b> <b>piles</b> on the rigid layer is the best solution, therefore the <b>anchoring</b> of the <b>piles</b> is not a negligible factor in the deep foundation.|$|R

This paper presents the behavior of a GAP system in a loose sandy soil. The small-scale laboratory tests were conducted on a loose dry sand to investigate the effect of embedded length of pile on the uplift capacity of the GAP system. The results were compared with the numerical analysis using a three-dimesional finite-element analysis software. In the detailed numerical study, the effects of key parameters, such as length (L) and diameter (D) of pile and the elastic modulus of surrounding soil, on the uplift capacity of the GAP were examined. The load-displacement response of the GAP was also analyzed and is reported in this paper. For a constant diameter of the GAP, its ultimate uplift capacity increases as the L/D ratio increases. However, for L/D ratios greater than 10, further increase in the L/D ratio does not contribute to the load sharing significantly. The bulging failure predominantly occurs in the GAP with a higher modulus ratio, whereas the shaft failure occurs with the lower modulus ratios...|$|E
40|$|Floating Production Storage Offloading vessels (FPSOs) {{are widely}} used in {{offshore}} {{oil and gas industry}} in harsh environments reach at the Grand Banks. Vessels working at an offshore site must be held in position despite the effects of wind, waves, and current. Many FPSOs are keeping position using seafloor anchors which are commonly secured using anchor piles. Anchor piles are very effective in many soils. The pile can either be drilled in and grouted, using an offshore mobile drilling rig, or driven in with an underwater hammer or a follower. The <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> resists pullout by a combination of bending plus passive resistance and skin friction shear. [...] Correctly designed pile anchors should transfer the environmental loads on the floating platforms to the seabed safely. In-service, these anchor piles are subjected {{to a wide range of}} monotonic and cyclic lateral to oblique pull forces. The large cyclic forces applied during extreme storm will tend to govern the design. [...] The presented work aims at identifying the behavior and capacity of anchor piles used for anchoring offshore floating structures in dense sand. As full-scale experimental verification is not always possible, this raises up the need to design a physical model which can simulate the behavior of the full-scale case. To simulate the important gravitational component, the physical model tests were conducted using the geotechnical centrifuge to investigate the anchor piles response to mooring forces in saturated dense sand. Two centrifuge tests setup were carried out. In each test setup four model pipe piles were jacked in flight in homogeneous saturated sand and subjected to monotonic and cyclic pull-out forces with inclination angle 0 ° (pure lateral loading), 16 °, 30 °, and 90 ° (pure tension loading) with the horizontal. The soil pile interaction behavior was monitored through the strain gauges attached on the pile. While the undisturbed soil stiffness distribution with depth will be measured using a shear wave measurement system of bender elements which can provide soil shear modulus distribution with depth. [...] To study many factors that are affecting the model, a 3 -D finite element model (FEM) was validated from the experimental centrifuge results. The validated FEM was used to do a parametric study to get design procedures and provide better understanding of the response of anchor piles to a variety of loading conditions. The parameters that will affect the pile behavior as suggested from the previous researchers and will be studied here are pile diameter, pile flexibility, load inclination angle, and padeye depth on the pile. [...] From the present study, it was found that there is a significant interaction between lateral and tension loading. A design method was proposed to predict the ultimate capacity of offshore <b>anchor</b> <b>pile</b> depending on pile flexibility, loading angle and padeye depth.

30|$|The {{anchorage}} of {{the piles}} on a stiffer soil layer {{plays an important}} role to transmit the loads of the superstructure to the soil. Depending on the pile toe condition, three configurations of piles are considered: floating <b>piles,</b> rested, and <b>anchored</b> <b>piles.</b> To study the effect of the pile toe condition on the dynamic response of pile and pile groups, a three-dimensional finite element modeling of the soil–pile–slab dynamic interaction is presented. The soil and piles are represented as continuum solids and the slab by structural elements. Quiet boundaries are placed at the boundaries of the model to avoid wave reflection. The formulation is based on the substructuring method. The dynamic response is obtained in terms of the dynamic impedances. In this study the dynamic response of the floating, rested, and <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> are analyzed and the group effect is shown.

40|$|Elastic-plastic, closed-form {{solutions}} {{were developed}} recently by the author, {{to capture the}} nonlinear response of laterally loaded rigid piles. Presented in compact form, the solutions are convenient to use, and sufficiently accurate despite using only two input parameters of the net limiting force per unit length pu along the pile, and a subgrade modulus k. Nevertheless, piles may be subjected to limited cap-restraints or loading below ground surface, which alter the response remarkably. This paper provides explicit expressions for estimating loading capacity of <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> and develops new solutions for lateral piles with cap-rotation by stipulating a constant pu or a linear increasing pu (Gibson pu) with depth. Lateral loading capacity Ho (at the tip-yield state and yield at rotation point state) and maximum bending moment Mm (at the tip-yield state) are presented against loading locations, and in form of the lateral capacity Ho-. Mo (applied moment) locus. The capacity is consistent with available solutions for <b>anchored</b> <b>piles,</b> and caissons with either pu profile, allowing a united approach from lateral <b>piles</b> to <b>anchored</b> <b>piles.</b> The new solutions are also presented in charts to highlight the impact of rotational stiffness of pile-cap on nonlinear response, offering a united approach for free-head piles through fixed-head piles. Several advantages of the solutions are identified against the prevalent p-. y curve based approach. To estimate the key parameter pu, values of the resistance factor Np (=ratio of pile-soil limiting resistance over the undrained shear strength su) are deduced using the current expressions against available normalised pile capacity involving the impact of gapping (between pile and soil), pile movement mode, pile slenderness ratio, inclined loading angle (<b>anchored</b> <b>piles)</b> and batter angles (lateral piles). The Np is characterised by: (i) An increase from 5. 6 - 8. 6 to 10. 14 - 11. 6, as gapping is eliminated around lateral piles and caissons, and from 1. 0 - 6. 1 to 2. 8 - 9. 8, as translation is converted into rotation mode of footings. (ii) Similar variations with slenderness ratio between anchors and caissons (without gapping), and among anchors, caissons and pipelines (with gapping).

30|$|Deep {{foundations}} like piles {{are commonly}} used to ensure the stability of structures located in seismic zones. The stability of the structures is ensured {{in relation to the}} efforts or tilting induced by the seismic loading. The design and calculation of deep foundations in seismic zones involves numerous parameters especially the behavior of soil, of the piles and of the different interactions between these constituents and the structures located at the surface. A very important parameter of the soil–pile–structure interaction which should be studied is the <b>anchoring</b> of <b>piles</b> in hard soil layers (Messioud et al. 2016 a). The dynamic response of rested or <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> is still unclear such as the substratum effect on the dynamic response of pile group foundations. Rested and <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> on a non-deformable substratum reduce the vertical and horizontal displacements of the piles and increase the rigidity of the piles groups Messioud et al. (2016 b). Okyay et al. (2012) used a series of dynamic tests conducted on an experimental site and developed numerical models to study the influence of the pile end-fixity conditions on the dynamic behavior of soil–piles–slab systems. Therefore, a thorough study of the seismic behavior of deep foundations is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the latter system. The soil–structure interaction in dynamics is characterized by impedance functions (Kausel et al. 1978; Pecker 1984; Aubry and Clouteau 1992).|$|R

40|$|Ports are {{civil works}} {{which have a}} major {{societal}} and economic importance. Quay structures are infrastructural elements of primary significance for the functioning of a port system. The ability to economically design quay structures with sufficient seismic resistance is therefore of great importance when situated {{in areas that are}} prone to earthquakes. Conventional seismic design is force-based i. e. that structures are designed to have sufficient capacity to withstand a pseudo-static seismic design force. This methodology is associated with no insight in the performance of the structure when exceeding the pseudo-static limit equilibrium state and uneconomic design due to the demand that the structure can resist a very high seismic design force without deforming. A more advanced alternative is Performance-Based Design (PBD) methodology. In this methodology the key design parameters for the seismic performance of structures are stress states and deformations of soil and structure, rather than just a seismic design force. Furthermore it recognizes that varying amounts of permanent deformations associated with different degrees of (repairable) damage are allowable. The present study is embedded in the topic of performance-based seismic design of quay structures. Typical quay types are gravity-based quay walls, sheet pile quay walls and pile-deck structures. The observed trend in seismic quay design is that gravity and sheet pile type structures (i. e. retaining walls) are associated with areas with zero to low seismicity while pile-deck structures are generally the preferred solution in areas with higher seismicity. This can be explained by more favourable seismic performance (i. e. more deformation capacity) of pile-deck structures compared to retaining walls. In line with this trend it is found that PBD methodology is developed to significant lesser extent for retaining walls (especially <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> walls) than for pile-deck structures. Therefore the present study focuses on performance-based seismic design of <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls. In the seismic design methodology there are generally three levels of seismic analysis available, i. e. simplified analysis (pseudo-static), simplified dynamic analysis and dynamic analysis. Simplified analysis of <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls is associated with conventional design methodology. Simplified dynamic analysis can be used to obtain a first estimate of permanent-displacement of a structure after exceeding limit equilibrium, based on an assumed failure mode. This type of analysis has to be made more suitable for <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls. In dynamic analysis the seismic behaviour of a structure can be simulated by means of finite element software. Experience has shown that it is desirable to consider sheet pile quay walls in a less conservative way in (preliminary) seismic design for which pseudo-static methodology is commonly applied. Therefore the general objective of the present study is to propose improvements on (simplified) seismic design methodologies for <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls by considering deformation behaviour. For this purpose a research methodology is developed in which pseudo-static, permanent-displacement and FE analysis are employed, calibrated with an experimental reference case that considers a typical <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall. The reference case is taken from a conference paper. It reports on a shake table test under centrifugal gravity which is performed on a scale model of an existing sheet pile quay wall with a batter <b>pile</b> <b>anchor.</b> The quay is situated in homogeneous soil that consists of coarse densified sand. Due to the soil condition liquefaction effects are prevented. Sequential seismic loading of increasing severity is applied during the shake table testing. Measurement results that are reported in the reference case paper comprise bending moments in the sheet pile wall, normal forces in the anchor rod and horizontal displacements of the sheet pile wall. For simplified analysis a calibrated D-SHEET PILING model of the reference case <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall is created. Through an iterative pseudo-static calculation procedure in which D-SHEET PILING and reference case dynamic bending moment results are fitted, it is attempted to find a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall that can be applied in pseudo-static design methodology. For simplified dynamic analysis an analytical limit equilibrium model is developed, based on the failure behaviour of the reference case. The goal of this model is that it can compute the critical acceleration of the anchored quay structure and estimate the sheet pile forces at this critical state. These abilities are validated with PLAXIS 2 D and checked with the reference case measurements respectively. Six accelerograms in the reference case soil column, obtained with equivalent linear site-response analysis (with SHAKE 2000), are combined with the computed critical acceleration for permanent-displacement (sliding-block) analysis. For dynamic analysis a calibrated PLAXIS 2 D model of the reference case <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall is created. Dynamic performance of the PLAXIS 2 D model is validated with SHAKE 2000 by comparing site-response analysis results of both models. Pseudo-static and pseudo-dynamic calculations are applied to obtain the critical acceleration. Dynamic calculations with six bedrock motions are carried out to simulate the reference case experiment. PLAXIS 2 D calculation results are used to validate simplified and simplified dynamic analysis results and to gain insight in the seismic failure behaviour of the <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall. Approaches for (simplified) performance-based seismic analysis of a typical <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall are proposed {{as a result of the}} research. For pseudo-static methodology a deformation-based seismic load reduction for structural forces in the sheet pile wall is proposed. For the present reference case it is concluded that a reduction in the range of 45 % to 50 % is allowable. For simplified dynamic analysis a limit equilibrium model is proposed to compute the critical acceleration of the present quay structure and to estimate sheet pile forces at this critical state. It is concluded that the ability of the limit equilibrium model is satisfactory. Although subjected to uncertainty, permanent-displacement analysis results indicate that the sliding-block analysis, originally developed for embankments, is possibly not suitable for <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls. For dynamic analysis it is concluded that PLAXIS 2 D is able to compute the reference case failure behaviour reasonably well, despite some computational setbacks. Complementary is the conclusion that PLAXIS 2 D pseudo-static approach proves to be suitable to determine the critical acceleration of an <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> structure in contrast to pseudo-dynamic approach which appears less suitable for that matter. In addition the performance-based design principle is linked to the present study so that an idea about the seismic performance limits of <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay walls in quantitative terms can be provided. As a result of the present study findings it is recommended to perform more extensive research on the ability of permanent-displacement analysis to evaluate the amount of sliding displacement of an <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> quay wall. In line with this recommendation it is found that further research on site-response analysis is desirable in the application of simplified dynamic and dynamic analysis. In general it is recommended to create more seismic test cases with different setups for a broader validity of the present results, to develop a seismic test case for the Groningen earthquake situation, to add measurement instrumentation to new and existing structures for verification of research results and to make such (raw) measurement data available to the public.

The results show that settlement value of numerical simulation is larger than that of field test {{in the process of}} loading, the difference value is widening with the increasing of load, and the ultimate difference value of settlement is 20 % to 30 %.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{geostatic}} analysis of temporary excavation pit for installation of pump station and service shaft. They {{are part of}} the project named Renewal of public sewerage, waterwork and road reconstruction in Savska cesta in Kranj. Nearby buildings, local road, Kokra river and design depth of pump station dictate realization of temporary protection of construction pit under phreatic level. Analysis are executed analytically and numericaly using computer program Plaxis. Analytically soil stresses are calculated by Rankine earth pressure theory, otherwise the computer program Plaxis is based on finite element method (FEM). We checked folowing examples of protection of construction pit: cantilever <b>pile</b> wall, <b>anchored</b> <b>pile</b> wall, struted pile wall, well and sheet piling frame. Eurocode standard EC 7 is considered in calculations. Various examples are also analysed and compared by economical and technological criterion...|$|R

40|$|Suction <b>pile</b> <b>anchors</b> {{are large}} {{cylindrical}} (inverted bucket type structure) {{open at the}} bottom and closed at the top and largely used for mooring of offshore platforms, exploratory vessels etc. Prediction of the mooring capacity of suction piles is a critical issue faced by the design engineers and rational methods are required to produce reliable designs. Tests have been conducted in an existing natural pond within NIOT campus with the objective of developing methodology of deployment, design and logistics for suction pile installation and testing of mooring capacity under static pullout. Small size suction piles with varying diameters and lengths have been used in the tests. The tests have been carried out in the natural pond with constant water depth of 1. 5 m with the top 1. 5 m layer of bed comprising soft marine clay. It is found that pile geometry, aspect ratio and angle of pullout have a significant influence on the response to pullout. As angle of mooring load application changes from vertical to horizontal the reaction offered by the suction pile changes from skin friction to passive soil resistance. Resistance offered by the internal plug of soil is found to vary according to dimension of the <b>anchor</b> <b>piles...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{pile toe}} {{condition}} on a stiffer soil layer {{plays an important}} role to transmit loads from the superstructure to the soil. Given the complexity of the soil–pile–slab interaction problem and the strong coupling between the different elements forming this foundation system, a three-dimensional finite element numerical modeling with absorbing boundaries is proposed. The aim of this modeling is to analysis the influence of the fixing conditions of the piles in the hard soil on the dynamic response of soil–pile–slab systems. To model the soil and piles, volumic elements are considered and the slab is considered using structural elements. The dynamic impedances are calculated from the displacements obtained at the point of application of the exciting force. Floating, rested and <b>anchored</b> <b>piles</b> in a hard soil layer are analyzed and the effect of groups is also studied. The vertical and horizontal dynamic impedance are presented for different configuration.|$|R
40|$|A {{subdomain}} {{approach for}} dynamic soil-structure interaction is {{proposed for the}} linear elastic seismic analysis of an <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile,</b> retaining a horizontally layered soil on rigid bedrock, A hybrid Solution technique is used, employing a finite element formulation for the generalized sheet pile, a thin layer formulation for the soil and a direct Stiffness formulation for the tieback; the displacement vectors of the sheet pile and the soil are decomposed, using the eigenmodes of the sheet pile and the propagating or decaying modes in the soil. The discretization can {{be limited to the}} interface(s), where pointwise continuity of the displacements is enforced, whereas a weak variational formulation is used for the stress equilibrium. The solution technique is illustrated by means of a numerical example, where the harmonic response of a flexible <b>anchored</b> sheet <b>pile</b> is considered and compared to the case where no tieback is present.

40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} slope {{stability}} analysis, foundation and support measures of a lightweight wooden residential house on an avalanche-prone slope. The work discusses {{in detail the}} problematic of the stability of a slope in the SLIDE program. Stability of the slope is analyzed at an estimated average and critical water level. Two different geotechnical measures are carried out for the aforementioned water levels. The first set of measures consists of {{an analysis of the}} concrete grid, which is anchored in bedrock, while an example of the second measurements is an <b>anchored</b> <b>pile</b> wall with a few pilots in an additional row, which are also embedded in the bedrock. Due {{to the nature of the}} inclined slope a lot of the information had to be simplified in order to use the analytical methods described in the thesis. The end includes a financial overhaul of both implementations of the two geotechnical measures at different water levels...|$|R

Ground anchors are also {{often used to}} stabilize landsides. This memo describes areas that are typical in design of earth retaining systems using ground anchors. For more detailed information, please see the references listed {{at the end of}} this memo. (II) Lateral Earth Pressures Consult with Geotechnical Services for suitable lateral earth pressure distribution for the project. For earth retaining systems constructed from the top down and restrained by ground anchors (tiebacks), the lateral earth pressure acting on the wall height, H, may be determined as described below. The lateral earth pressure distribution for the design of temporary or permanent anchored walls constructed in cohesionless soils may be determined using equations provided in AASHTO LRFD BDS (2007). In those special situations where there exists external loading in addition to lateral earth pressure, such as a slip plane or adjacent structures, etc, the following equations based on P may be used to determine p. Consult Geotechnical total a Services for the evaluation of P in these cases. total For walls with a single level of anchors...|$|R
