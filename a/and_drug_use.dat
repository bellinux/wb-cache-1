40|$|Background: Treatment success among HIV+ persons {{under an}} {{antiretroviral}} regimen strongly rely on individual factors. Objective: To test {{the variables of}} a psychological model {{and the influence of}} alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> in the prediction of medication-adherence behaviors. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 124 HIV+ persons recruited in an outpatient clinic in the state of Lara, Venezuela, who completed a self-administered questionnaire measuring psychological variables and medication-adherence behaviors, as well as an index of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use.</b> Moment-product correlation <b>and</b> structural equation modeling were applied for data analyses. Results: Current behavioral competencies showed a direct effect on medication-adherence behaviors, mediating the indirect effect of low alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use.</b> The structural equation modeling demonstrated a good fit to the sample data: Ï‡ 2 / gl = 1. 42, GFI = 0. 99, AGFI = 0. 94, NFI = 0. 98, CFI = 0. 99, FD = 0. 02 [FDMI = 1. 13], PNCP = 0. 01 [PNCPMI = 1. 08], RMSEA = 0. 05, RMSSR = 0. 04. Conclusion: Behavioral competencies and low alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>use</b> were significant predictors of medication-adherence behaviors. Further research direction, including national wide of HIV+ persons from Venezuela and the development of interdisciplinary interventions that promote and sustain medication-adherence behaviors are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Famous former {{residents}} {{include the}} musician Tricky, the boxer Dixie Brown and late 1950s {{rock and roll}} band the Eagles. There are five schools and four churches in Knowle West, {{as well as a}} number of open spaces, community centres, youth clubs and shopping facilities. Community organisations include the Knowle West Media Centre, the Residents' Planning Group and the Knowle West Health Association. There are no major employers in Knowle West but there are many small local enterprises and larger businesses on nearby trading estates. The closure of the Imperial Tobacco factory at nearby Hartcliffe in 1990 caused a large number of job losses. Just under a third of the residents are classed as economically inactive and the area is one of the most economically deprived in Bristol. Knowle West has relatively high indices of crime <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> but community efforts to combat this have had some success.|$|E
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} of the immune system are inactive. The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E

30|$|In our study, however, {{we found}} no {{associations}} between weight training frequency <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Prior research on the association between physical activity <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is mixed: Some {{studies suggest that the}} degree of sporting activity is negatively associated with substance use [43]. Others point to a curvilinear link between sporting activities <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> i.e., that inactive and intensive levels are associated with greater <b>use</b> of illicit <b>drugs</b> than moderate levels are, particularly for strength sports (weightlifting and body-building) [19]. However, these studies have largely been based on adolescent populations, and it has been proposed that the relationship between physical activity <b>and</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> is affected by age [19], which could explain our differing results.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to investigate perceptions of snowfield resort visitors about injury risk regarding alcohol, fatigue <b>and</b> recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Visitors to a resort village in a large Australian snowfield region completed a brief survey about fatigue, alcohol <b>and</b> recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> <b>and</b> injury risk perception. Participants stated their ability to ski or snowboard and drive safely following a lack of sleep, alcohol <b>and</b> recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Intoxicated snowfield resort visitors were compared with non-intoxicated visitors. Safety beliefs across snow sport and transport were compared. Participants reported that they generally slept less than usual and 30 % reported both drinking alcohol <b>and</b> <b>using</b> <b>drugs</b> more than usual while visiting the snowfields. Participants perceived driving as a greater injury risk than skiing/snowboarding (p 5 0. 001). Fatigue was perceived as a relatively weak injury risk factor, particularly whilst skiing and snowboarding. Awareness needs to be raised among snowfield resort visitors about the contribution of alcohol, fatigue <b>and</b> recreational <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> to snow sport and transport-related injury risk...|$|R
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use.</b> Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios, {{which had}} won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take {{advantage}} of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live, Animal House, and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film {{one of the most expensive}} comedies ever produced.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} modifiable {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking (active and passive), drinking lots of alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>use,</b> lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption and unhealthy diet. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E
40|$|KEY FINDINGS Characteristics of the neighbourhoods {{in which}} young people live do {{play a role in}} {{influencing}} aspects of their delinquent <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>using</b> behaviour, although their impact is relatively weak in comparison to the effect of individual characteristics, such as gender and personality. The neighbourhood factors involved in explaining higher levels of delinquency, cannabis <b>and</b> hard <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> amongst 16 year olds are quite different, which indicates that a different theoretical framework may be needed to understand the contextual effects of areas on different problematic behaviours. Whereas delinquency <b>and</b> hard <b>drug</b> <b>use</b> are partially explained by negative neighbourhood characteristics (such as greater deprivation in the case of delinquency and higher crime rates for hard <b>drug</b> <b>use),</b> more frequent cannabis use is greater within prosperous neighbourhoods but also within areas in which there is greater social disorganisation.
