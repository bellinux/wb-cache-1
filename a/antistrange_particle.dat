Strange particles appear copiously due to [...] "associated production" [...] of a strange and an <b>antistrange</b> <b>particle</b> together. It was soon shown that this could not be a multiplicative quantum number, because that would allow reactions which were never seen in the new synchrotrons which were commissioned in Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1953 and in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1955.|$|E

In this paper, the system, X, is identified as one of the following neutral combinations; K[subscript]sps 0 K[subscript]sps 0, K[subscript]sps 0 K[superscript]±[pi][superscript][minus or plus], [lambda][superscript] 0 [macron][lambda][superscript] 0, [lambda][superscript] 0 [macron][lambda][superscript] 0 *. These data were obtained in proton-proton collisions at √s = 62 GeV at the CERN ISR. The triggering systems used to obtain these data are described, followed by a description of the data. The central system mass distributions {{are presented}} along with differential mass cross section estimates. A broad enhancement is seen in the K[subscript]sps 0 K[subscript]sps 0 system at a mass of 1. 2 GeV, and is likely to have the quantum numbers J[superscript]PC = 0 [superscript]++. Total cross section estimates of 1. 3 ±. 64 [mu] b in the K[subscript]sps 0 K[subscript]sps 0 system,. 44 ±. 14 [mu] b in the K[subscript]sps 0 K[superscript]±[pi][superscript][minus or plus] system,. 20 ±. 14 [mu] b in the [lambda][superscript] 0 [macron][lambda][superscript] 0 system, and. 13 ±. 06 [mu] b in the [lambda][superscript] 0 [macron][lambda][superscript] 0 * system are obtained...|$|E
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that the recent data on strange baryon and antibaryon {{production}} in Pb-Pb collisions at 159 GeV/c agree well with the hypothesis of an intermediate state of quasi-free and randomly distributed constitutent quarks and antiquarks. Also the S-S data are consistent with this hypothesis. The p-Pb data follow a different pattern. Recently, rather precise data on strange baryon and antibaryon production in the central rapidity region of Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions were presented by the WA 97 collaboration [1]. In this note I would {{like to point out that}} these Pb-Pb data agree rather well with a simple quark-counting rule whereas the p-Pb data follow a different pattern. This observation implies that the quark degrees of freedom are much more relevant in collisions of two heavy nuclei than in ”elementary ” hadronic interactions. It thus supports the interpretation of the data on strangeness production in Pb-Pb collisions as an evidence for creation of the quark-gluon plasma [2, 3]. Our argument is an application of the old idea proposed first by Rafelski [4]. Considering a system of partons in thermodynamic equilibrium (i. e. quark-gluon plasma), he observed that strange (and <b>antistrange)</b> <b>particle</b> Address: Reymonta 4, 30 - 059 Krakow, Poland...|$|E
