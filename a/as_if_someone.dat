5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the {{swelling of the}} knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
25|$|Zanfona (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, {{with three}} melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older {{examples}} had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually {{tuned to the}} key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the bordonciño in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the bordón in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the bordonciño (this string was sometimes known as the human voice, because it sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> is humming the melody an octave lower).|$|E

The Twelfth Doctor remarks it seems <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> is trying to bring the Doctor and Clara together. The episode [...] "Death in Heaven" [...] reveals it was the Master (as Missy) who gave the number to Clara.|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} the series, [...] "Woodentop", {{featured}} a short theme composed by Mike Westergaard. The theme was used specifically for the episode and was never used {{at any time during}} the main series. The title sequence for the episode consisted simply of the word 'Woodentop' being spelt out letter by letter, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> was writing it on a typewriter.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the name [...] "antlion" [...] is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large {{percentage}} of the prey of the insect, the suffix [...] "lion" [...] merely suggesting destroyer or hunter. In any case, the term seems to go back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a [...] "doodlebug" [...] in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> has been doodling.|$|E

Otherwise, they are counted <b>as</b> nonparticipants. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> resigns from a  job, he is not eligible for unemployment benefits for up to the first   12   weeks. We therefore counted {{the first three months}} after an employment spell <b>as</b> unemployed <b>if</b> unemployment benefit reception or employment occurs after that period.|$|R
500|$|Publishers Weekly praised An Ideal World for {{its message}} and art, but criticized how [...] "the book gets {{bogged down in}} talky heavy-handedness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> put nice fantasy {{illustrations}} into a business self-help book". R. Bézard, a French critic for BD Gest, rated {{the first volume of}} the Xiao Pan edition of An Ideal World with two out of five stars. Bézard stated that the volume did not draw in the reader or give any indication of A You's future adventure. However, Bézard [...] praised the artwork [...] as [...] expressive and called it a cross between Dragon Ball Z and Fruits Basket.|$|E

This is a {{depiction of the}} pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District12 mayor's daughter, Madge Undersee. The image matches {{the description of the}} pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: [...] "It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's overall {{structure}} {{was influenced by}} the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler. Ethan said, [...] "We wanted something that would generate a certain narrative feeling – like a modern Raymond Chandler story, and that's why it had to be set in Los Angeles ... We wanted to have a narrative flow, a story that moves like a Chandler book through different parts of town and different social classes." [...] The use of the Stranger's voice-over also came from Chandler as Joel remarked, [...] "He {{is a little bit of}} an audience substitute. In the movie adaptation of Chandler it's the main character that speaks off-screen, but we didn't want to reproduce that though it obviously has echoes. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> was commenting on the plot from an all-seeing point of view. And at the same time rediscovering the old earthiness of a Mark Twain." ...|$|E

If so desired, the Imam would give daily recitations and invocations <b>as</b> well. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> had the eagerness {{to learn the}} {{sciences}} of gnosis and realization of Allah, the Imam would ask that person to attend the lessons of Futoohaat-e-Makkiyya.|$|R
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviewers {{gave the}} film {{positive}} reviews. New York magazine's David Edelstein claimed {{in his review}} to [...] "have no idea what {{so many people are}} raving about. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea that Inception is a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself." [...] Rex Reed of The New York Observer explained the film's development as [...] "pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times commented [...] "there is a lot to see in Inception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness." [...] David Denby, writing in The New Yorker, considered the film not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be, concluding, [...] "Inception is a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else." ...|$|E
500|$|In Stanley Kubrick's 1968 {{science fiction}} film , {{astronaut}} David Bowman slowly disassembles {{the mind of}} an artificial intelligence named HAL by sequentially unplugging its memory banks. Carr likened the emotions of despair expressed by HAL as its mind is disassembled to his own, at the time, cognitive difficulties in engaging with long texts. He felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> was [...] "tinkering with [...] brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory". HAL had also {{been used as a}} metaphor for the [...] "ultimate search engine" [...] in a PBS interview with Google co-founder Sergey Brin as noted in Carr's book The Big Switch, and also Brin's TED talk. Brin was comparing Google's ambitions of building an artificial intelligence to HAL, while dismissing the possibility that a bug like the one that led HAL to murder the occupants of the fictional spacecraft Discovery One could occur in a Google-based artificial intelligence. Carr observed in his essay that throughout history technological advances have often necessitated new metaphors, such as the mechanical clock engendering the simile [...] "like clockwork" [...] and the age of the computer engendering the simile [...] "like computers". Carr concluded his essay with an explanation as to why he believed HAL was an appropriate metaphor for his essay's argument. He observed that HAL showed genuine emotion as his mind was disassembled while, throughout the film, the humans onboard the space station appeared to be automatons, thinking and acting as if they were following the steps of an algorithm. Carr believed that the film's prophetic message was that as individuals increasingly rely on computers for an understanding of their world their intelligence may become more machinelike than human.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} the album {{consists}} of a meaningless phrase made solely of four grammatical Chinese particles from Classical Chinese. The phrase functions <b>as</b> an adjective; <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> Chinese is [...] "Zhi hu zhe ye", it means it is stale and archaic.|$|R
50|$|Quoting out {{of context}} (sometimes {{referred}} to as contextomy or quote mining) is an informal fallacy and a type of false attribution in which a passage is removed from its surrounding matter {{in such a way}} as to distort its intended meaning. Contextomies may be both intentional, as well <b>as</b> accidental <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> misunderstands the meaning and omits something essential to clarifying it, thinking it to be non-essential.|$|R
5000|$|Thus we have {{a unique}} solution. This {{argument}} easily extents to N categories, to give the [...] "flat" [...] prior probability 1/N.This provides a consistency based argument {{to the principle of}} indifference which goes <b>as</b> follows: <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> is truly ignorant about a discrete/countable set of outcomes apart from their potential existence, but does not assign them equal prior probabilities, then they are assigning different probabilities when given the same information.|$|R
500|$|... "One of Those Days" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sean Daly of The Washington Post {{commented that the}} song was [...] "likably [...] bouncy". Craig Seymour of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the song a [...] "breezy girls'-night-out" [...] cut. Writer for Blues & Soul wrote that the song [...] "is an excellent slice of soulful mid-beat head nod R". They also commended the sampling of [...] "Between the Sheets", noting that it is [...] "effective". Ernest Hardy of LA Weekly had different opinions of the song. Although he deemed it an [...] "underrated single" [...] at first and wrote that it [...] "leaps beyond its work-sucks-the-rent's-late-I-need-a-date griping {{into the realm of}} existential letting", he later commented that the song is [...] "grounded in retort". Chuck Taylor of Billboard remarked that the song marks a [...] "triumphant return of one of the great singers, who delivers the goods in glorious voice." [...] He further commented that the production of the song would be able to convince her [...] "pop fans", and also praised the Isley Brothers sampling. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song could have been titled [...] "How Whitney Got Her Groove Back". He noted that the [...] "smooth" [...] track allows Houston to offer a restrained delivery of her vocals. Keysha Davis of BBC Music called the sampling of [...] "Between the Sheets" [...] as [...] "clever". Nakesa Mumbi Moody, of the Associated Press, wrote it was [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "dreamy". Writing for The Boston Globe, Joan Anderman called it a [...] "breezy" [...] track with a [...] "disturbingly trite" [...] theme. [...] The German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, in their review for [...] "One of Those Days" [...] called the song [...] "schmaltzy" [...] and wrote {{that it could have been}} done in the 1980s. Jimmy Draper of San Francisco Bay Guardian noted that [...] "the song seems so anticlimactic in comparison to the real-life pot". Jon Caramanica of Rolling Stone called the track [...] "creaky and unconvincing". Entertainment Weekly gave the remix single a D rating and commented negatively that [...] "this chaotic mess isn't likely to find an enthusiastic audience" [...] as the producer [...] "laid a random Nelly verse and some whistle beats on top of Houston's vocals. It's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> opened the door between two rooms and cranked warring stereos". Following Houston's death in 2012, Entertainment Weekly published a list of Houston's 25 best songs and ranked [...] "One of Those Days" [...] at number 19; they noted that it was [...] "an underrated single off an underrated album". They further commented that [...] "Whitney gave women of the world an instruction manual for pampering themselves in the Sex and the City era".|$|E
2500|$|... "Under the Milky Way" [...] {{features}} a 12-string acoustic guitar melody {{along with a}} solo composed with an EBow on a Fender Jazzmaster, and recorded [...] on a Synclavier, leading to a sound reminiscent of bagpipes. In October 1990 Jansson told John Tingwell of Drum Media about songwriting with Kilbey [...] "it's a very spontaneous thing. It's not <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> has put us together to write a hit song. It's more like sometimes when we write together, a song comes knocking on the door". While in September 2008 Kilbey discussed the track with Iain Shedden of The Australian.|$|E
2500|$|From the 1960s, Copland turned {{increasingly}} to conducting. Though not enamored with the prospect, {{he found himself}} without new ideas for composition, saying, [...] "It was exactly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> had simply turned off a faucet." [...] He became a frequent guest conductor in the United States and the United Kingdom and {{made a series of}} recordings of his music, primarily for Columbia Records. In 1960, RCA Victor released Copland's recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra of the orchestral suites from Appalachian Spring and The Tender Land; these recordings were later reissued on CD, as were most of Copland's Columbia recordings (by Sony).|$|E

In the March 10, 2002 issue of The New York Post, {{it was reported that}} the current restaurant owners and staff have witnessed figures seated at tables or heading down to the restaurant's basement, but then the mysterious figures vanish. These are allegedly the ghosts of DeBatt and Joseph D'Angelo. They also report hearing voices and the sound of a chainsaw. They say they can smell foul odors and they had the feeling that they were being watched by someone. A cousin of the current restaurant owner, Angela Perrone stated, [...] "The place is definitely haunted. There's a creepiness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone's</b> always watching you.

[...] The visual effects team emulated these six fire parameters: heat ripples, smoke, buoyancy, viscosity, opacity, and brightness. Since the whole fire scene was very time consuming, computer graphics artist Chris Horvath spent eight months finding a faster way to conjure flames.|$|E

Writing in Esquire in 1967, Robert Christgau called it [...] "an album that for innovation, tightness, and lyrical intelligence was about twice as good as anything they or anyone else (except maybe the Stones) had done previously". He later wrote: [...] "Rubber Soul smashed a lot of alienation. Without reneging on the group's masscult appeal, it reached into private lives and made hundreds of thousands of secretly lonely people feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> out there shared their brightest insights and most depressing discoveries … Psychedelia starts here." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{brief period}} in the late 1950s, Orbison made his living at Acuff-Rose, a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After {{spending}} an entire day writing a song, he would make several demo tapes {{at a time and}} send them to Wesley Rose, who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison attempted to sell to RCA Victor his recordings of songs by other writers, working with, and being in awe of, Chet Atkins, who had played guitar with Presley. One song he tried was [...] "Seems to Me" [...] by Boudleaux Bryant. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of [...] "a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene.
