5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action {{at two in the morning}} on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E

In 1988, Suicidal Tendencies, who had previously been a straightforward hardcore punk band, released their major label debut How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today.|$|E

It argues that Pound, in Fisher's poem, acts as both model and antagonist, forming {{a frame of}} reference through which Fisher creates his own anti-Thatcherite writing. At the same time, the chapter points out, Fisher critiques <b>and</b> undercuts <b>Pound's</b> essentialism, thus allowing 'Atkins Stomp' to attack free-market capitalism <b>and</b> <b>Pound's</b> fascism at the same time...|$|R

He also noted that solo violins (playing fifth intervals) and flutes are used in creating Wagnerian leitmotifs to highlight Silence's conflict within the society he is placed in.|$|E

500|$|Hed PE {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Blackout, on March 18, 2003. It peaked at No.33 on the Billboard 200, while its title track peaked at No.21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No.32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. Allmusic's Johnny Loftus wrote that [...] "While it expands on melodic elements {{that had previously}} played a supporting role in the band's sound, Blackout also delivers truckloads of crushing guitar <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> rhythm. And {{whether or not it}} is the presence of a top-line producer, (hed) pe have figured out a way to imbue their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip-hop with some serious hooks." [...] Guitarist Jaxon joined the band in early 2004. He is the fourth person to fill this position.|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of The Village Voice {{felt that}} the album [...] "never settles on a sound" [...] and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. Although he found the ballads to be {{improvements}} from Rihanna's previous albums, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an [...] "Achilles' high heel for Rihanna". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found Rihanna to be [...] "ill-suited" [...] for its dance-pop songs and stated, [...] "The gimmicky samples <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed." [...] Robert Christgau of MSN Music cited [...] "Umbrella" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money".|$|E
500|$|During construction, {{a series}} of {{mistakes}} collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200or so workers might {{have been used for}} a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used {{in other parts of the}} world. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included [...] "shouting <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> the table" [...] in frustration. The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.|$|E

[...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the song a rating of four stars out of five, and wrote that the song makes the listener as [...] "up-for it" [...] as Rihanna herself; he went on to say that [...] "S" [...] consists of [...] "ear-frotting" [...] hooks, synths <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> beats. James Skinner of BBC Music wrote that Loud lacked the [...] "chart-friendly moments" [...] of Rated R and criticized the overtly sexual lyrics which he found [...] "at odds with" [...] the flirtatious appeal for which Rihanna was aiming.

500|$|Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph {{said that}} [...] "with catchy choruses, soulful key changes and cute hooks laid bare, these are undeniably {{brilliant}} pop songs." [...] Jones further commented that [...] "finger clicks, bongos and mellow guitars are {{a welcome change}} from the squealing synths <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> beats favoured by Bieber and his peers," [...] and that the album {{had the ability to}} connect with audiences beyond his demographic. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] rating, stating [...] that the album doesn't change Bieber's beloved [...] "kiddie-soul vocals" [...] calling it [...] "perfunctory", but said that acoustic renditions such as [...] "Baby", [...] "One Time" [...] and new song [...] "Pray" [...] deliver their [...] "saccharine payload." [...] Thomas Conneron of Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "calming down several of the pop tunes with slower tempos and patient singing" [...] was not bad and that slowing everything down made listeners hear how the singer's voice had matured.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Grand Unification (2006), Vik Bansal of MusicOMH wrote about their varied dynamics: [...] "Where others are happy to be one-dimensional, Fightstar are not content unless a song moves fluidly through {{seemingly}} incongruous but ultimately coherent moods and musical dynamics. The interspersion of thoroughly heavy metal sections within the otherwise widescreen rock of 'Grand Unification Pt I' and 'Sleep Well Tonight' encapsulates this perfectly". One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours showed the band expanding their sound and pushing further into both lighter and heavier territories, {{with a mixture of}} more melodic soundscapes and heavier metallic styles. According to Q magazine, [...] "The intricate instrumental passages, multi-tracked vocal harmonies <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> riffs hint at Muse-scale ambition and intellect". The Sun described One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours sound as [...] "heavier, slicker and as focused as ever, tracks such as '99' and 'We Apologise For Nothing' embrace an epic, panoramic sound that sweeps you off your feet. It’s aggressive but emotive, with heaps of melody among the huge riffs." ...|$|E

500|$|Other legends {{describe}} Vithoba {{coming to}} the rescue of his devotees {{in the form of a}} commoner, an outcast Mahar [...] "untouchable" [...] or a Brahmin beggar. Mahipati, in his work Pandurangastrotra, narrates how Vithoba helped female saints like Janabai in their daily chores, such as sweeping the house <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> the rice. He narrates how Vithoba came to the aid of Sena the barber. The king of Bidar had ordered Sena to be arrested for not {{coming to the}} palace despite royal orders. As Sena was engrossed in his prayers to Vithoba, Vithoba went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king, and Sena was saved. Another tale deals with a saint, Damaji, the keeper of the royal grain store, who distributed grain to the people in famine. Vithoba came as an outcaste with a bag of gold to pay for the grain. Yet another story narrates how Vithoba resurrected the child of Gora Kumbara (potter), who had been trampled into the clay by Gora while singing the name of Vithoba.|$|E
500|$|The wider {{area of the}} Shfela {{has been}} {{inhabited}} for much longer. Excavations were conducted by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) about 12 kilometres northeast from Bayt Jibrin at a site located on the same wadi, Nahal Guvrin, near moshav Menuha. The IAA has unearthed there artifacts from a village believed to be 6,500 years old, placing {{it at the end}} of the Stone Age or at the beginning of the Chalcolithic or [...] "copper-and-stone age". The finds include pottery vessels and stone tools, among them flint sickle blades, cultic objects, clay figurines of horned animals, ceramic spindle whorls and animal bones belonging to pigs, goats, sheep and larger herbivores. The inhabitants probably chose this area due to the arable land and copious springs flowing even in the rainless summer months. Archaeologists believe the villagers grew grain, as indicated by the sickle blades and the grinding <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> tools, and raised animals that supplied milk, meat and wool, as attested to by the spindle whorls. The settlement was small in scope, approximately 1.5 dunams, but there is evidence of bartering, based on the presence of basalt vessels and other lithic objects brought to the site from afar.|$|E
500|$|The Bill Hamel remix of [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] is {{a trance}} track with {{elements}} of ambient. Spears' voice {{has been described}} as [...] "chopped up into skittering syllables and [...] becomes part of the beat". The album's fourth track, the Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] slows the beat from the original track making the song [...] "darker and dirtier". The remix style was compared to songs by Kylie Minogue and Madonna. Dave Audé Slave Driver Mix of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] consists of a guitar track and [...] "quirky analog touches", according to Kurt Kirton of About.com. [...] "And Then We Kiss" [...] contains influences of euro-trance, techno and usage of synthesizers. The song blends dance-rock guitars and symphonic strings and closes with an orchestral overtone. Its lyrics talk about a kiss and the different sensations that the protagonist experiences, including trembling, crying and moaning. At the beginning she sings the lines [...] "Lying alone / touching my skin" [...] which suggest that the whole song may actually be a fantasy. The album's seventh track, the Valentin remix of [...] "Everytime" [...] contains a serious groove <b>and</b> <b>pounding</b> percussion, with usage of synthesizers. The Jason Nevins remix of [...] "Early Mornin'" [...] is considered the only hip hop song of B in the Mix: The Remixes.|$|E
