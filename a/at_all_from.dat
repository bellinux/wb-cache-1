5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Bruce was {{followed}} by Lawrence N. Maxwell, counsel for Beckham. Maxwell reiterated that the General Assembly had acted within its enumerated powers under the state constitution in deciding {{the outcome of the}} disputed election. He claimed that the decision of the state court of appeals made it clear that Taylor had not been legally elected governor, and therefore never possessed the property he was now claiming had been taken from him without due process. Maxwell further asserted that this disposed of any federal questions with regard to the case, and that the Supreme Court could claim no jurisdiction. The decision of the state court of appeals should be allowed to stand, he concluded. Lewis McQuown further argued on behalf of Beckham that, even if Taylor's claim to the governorship were legitimate, the investigation and decision by the General Assembly's contest committee represented sufficient due process. He acknowledged that the Goebel Election Law's provision that the legislature be the arbiter of any contested gubernatorial election differed little if <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> provisions in as many as twenty other states. If the Goebel Election Law was constitutional, as it had before been declared, then the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction regarding how it had been administered.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for the driver to cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E

25|$|During the summer, blinds were fitted {{over the}} ends of all cars with normal staircases, so that when it rained or the sun shone {{directly}} into the driver’s eyes he could pull down this blind and gain a little protection.

25|$|Handwashing {{with soap}} {{consistently}} at critical moments {{during the day}} prevents the spread of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes. Handwashing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.

As a general rule, hand washing protects people poorly or not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> droplet and airborne diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis.|$|E

25|$|Rømer then {{applies the}} same logic to {{observations}} around the first quadrature (pointG), when Earth is moving towards Jupiter. The time difference between an immersion seen from pointF and the next immersion seen from pointG should be 3½minutes shorter than the true orbital period of Io. Hence, {{there should be a}} difference of about 7minutes between the periods of Io measured at the first quadrature and those measured at the second quadrature. In practice, no difference is observed <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>from</b> which Rømer concludes that the speed of light must be very much greater than one Earth-diameter per second.|$|E
25|$|Out of the 32 {{million people}} that {{received}} free basic water in 2005, almost half, or 15 million, were not poor. Furthermore, many poor in rural areas, who receive limited {{amounts of water}} for free through standpipes, do not benefit fully. Those without access to publicly provided water do not benefit <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> the program. The policy is more successful in wealthier municipalities, which {{have the ability to}} cross-subsidise water provision for the poor, than in poorer, often rural municipalities. This {{is one of the reasons}} why in 2009 the government announced it would review its implementation strategy for free basic water, possibly through registers of poor users.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{lethality}} and virulence of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus has recently been regarded to be the world's largest current pandemic threat, {{and billions of dollars}} are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic influenza vaccines in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> the strain would require at least three months after the virus's emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.|$|E

25|$|Although she was {{deprived}} of her lover, {{the end of}} the war saw an improvement in Rudge's fortunes as her sequestered Venetian home was returned to her. In order to avoid a trial for treason, Pound was declared criminally insane and incarcerated in an asylum, St. Elizabeths Hospital, where he remained for twelve years. Rudge began the onerous task of trying to secure his freedom. She used friends and their many contacts in the literary world to mount a petition attesting to his character and that amongst other things he had never in fact been a member of the Italian Fascist Party (Partito Nazionale Fascista). One of her ideas was that Pound be released to live in an American monastery, but all her entreaties fell on deaf ears. His letters discourage Rudge from visiting him but she did travel to America to visit him twice, once in 1952 and again in 1955. Pound at this time was receiving visits not only from his wife but other mistresses too. Following the 1955 visit, their letters to each other became cooler and more impersonal, and they rarely communicated <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> 1955 to 1959.|$|E
25|$|The Keys to the Kingdom {{are seven}} objects of power {{given to the}} Trustees along with command over their demesnes. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the {{rightful}} owner of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, somewhat from pain but not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> discomfort. A rightful owner of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, {{the use of a}} Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, balls that bounce {{slightly}} closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker. An effective yorker's length will be difficult to pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball. It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>from</b> bouncing off the pitch.|$|E
