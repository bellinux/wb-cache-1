Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums.

He would purchase rare books, engravings, lithographs and drawings. As he himself later noted, his taste for art was shaped by Cantacuzino, [...] "one of the greatest experts in painting and printing that I have ever met." [...] Together with other young Romanians, he was a regular customer at several cafés, including Procop, Soleil d'Or, and Café Voltaire. It was in this context that both Cantacuzino and Slătineanu became followers of socialism. They drew sympathy from Jean Jaurès, Georges Clemenceau and René Viviani, and were allowed to write in local newspapers about the ongoing controversy regarding the Transylvanian Memorandum signatories. Upon his return home in 1902, he became chief of operations at the experimental medicine department, newly established by Cantacuzino within the University of Bucharest's medical faculty.|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 2010, {{the first}} sneak peek <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Air, {{including}} two artworks [...] "Airship" [...] and [...] "Streets of Wish", was revealed {{on the official}} PlayFirst's blog, Inside PlayFirst. Art director at the developer KatGames, Pablo Vietto, explained the ideas behind [...] "Airship" [...] artwork that KatGames {{wanted to make a}} [...] "very rustic and compact interior where they could place everything necessary for the navigation of the airship." [...] The artistic inspiration came from the old machines designed by Da Vinci and used in the Jules Verne stories, but adapted to their own style. Meanwhile, adding comments about [...] "Streets of Wish" [...] artwork, Vietto expressed that he wanted to [...] "keep the essence of the Wish village from the first Dream , respecting the roofs and cupules in green tonalities." [...] The idea of having a house with a cupule for a roof was in his mind since the first Dream Chronicles, so this was the perfect opportunity to use it again. According to Vietto, some other details, like the iron works and lights, were inspired by works done by Hector Guimard, a French architect {{and one of the most}} important ones during Modernism.|$|E
