The thermal degradation of these specimens was analysed using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The samples were heated from ambient temperature to 500  °C at a heating rate of 20  °C/min. All specimens were decomposed under dry nitrogen (N 2) at a flow rate of 40  ml/min to yield gases and solid char. <b>Aluminised</b> E-glass composites were compared alongside the unmetallised E-glass and unreinforced composite. The major weight loss occurred between 200 and 400  °C. The unreinforced polyester had a maximum weight loss, 1. 25 %/°C, occurring at 360  °C. For the <b>aluminised</b> and unmetallised E-glass composites, the maximum rate of weight loss was 0. 34 and 0. 55 %/°C, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the effect of shading screens, normally used during the day for cooling purposes, on the night-time climate of unheated greenhouses. For this purpose, first a number of experimental measurements were taken during cold nights to characterise the greenhouse climate both with and without an <b>aluminised</b> external screen. Secondly a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) model of greenhouse was developed. After validation of the model by comparison with experimental data, the model was used to simulate the greenhouse climate for different sky conditions ranging from cloudless to overcast nights. Simulations were performed for a greenhouse with internal and external shading screens and for the same greenhouse without screens.

Its effect was much stronger under clear sky conditions. The CFD model supported this conclusion and provided a detailed explanation of the temperature behaviour of all the greenhouse types considered.

40|$|Coatings on low {{activation}} steels {{are required}} in fusion technology {{in order to}} reduce the tritium permeation rate through the steel into the cooling water system by a factor of at least 100. Alumina seems to be a promising coating material. However, an appropriate coating system must also have the potential for self healing since the ceramic alumina scale tends to fail if mechanical stress is applied. Hot-dip <b>aluminising</b> is an applicable technology to coat ferritic-martensitic steels which consists of two main process steps: firstly, hot dip <b>aluminising</b> of the steel (700 C, 30 s) Secondly, transformation of the very hard intermetallic scale Fe_ 2 Al_ 5 into FeAl and #alpha#-Fe(Al) phase during a subsequent heat treatment (1040 C, 30 min). The pressure chosen for the HIP experiment was 1000, 2000 and 3000 bar.

40|$|Open-cell nickel foams with 92 % {{porosity}} {{and uniform}} pore size and distribution {{were used in}} this study. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the behaviour of Ni-foam, when treated as volumetric receivers under concentrated solar radiation while improving their oxidation resistance, {{in order to make}} them attractive for such applications. The experimental investigation showed that their efficiency was depending on both materials parameters and flow conditions, the latter affecting the pressure drop and the heat transfer behaviour. The microstructural characterisation of oxide surface morphologies formed on the open-cell Ni foams exposed to concentrated solar radiation is investigated by the use of SEM and EDXS. SEM observations revealed a rapid homogeneous oxidation in the Ni-foam with three different surface oxide structures formed in relation with the process temperature. A novel slurry-based process for <b>aluminising</b> nickel foams while retaining their geometrical properties is applied in order to develop an aluminide-nickel intermetallic coating on a Ni foam thus enhancing the oxidation resistance.

2500|$|Gas flow {{proportional}} counters {{are used}} mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the wire diameter, a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, <b>aluminised</b> PET film and <b>aluminised</b> polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by [...] "pulse height selection" [...] in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.|$|R

40|$|Research to {{investigate}} advanced diffusion coatings for improved oxidation and hot corrosion resistance was conducted. The {{aim was to}} build on the performance of the standard aluminide on the nickel-base super alloy IN 738 LC. The main emphasis of this investigation was {{to examine the effects of}} adding small quantities of yttrium to the coating as well as to produce a platinum-modified aluminide diffusion coating which is accepted as the best industrial standard for diffusion aluminides at present. A pack diffusion process was used to produce the coatings in this current study. A standard aluminide coating was modified with a small YCI 3 (0. 5 Wt. %) addition to the pack, producing an aluminising-yttrising pack. In the platinum-modified altuninide coating process, a sample was coated with several microns of platinum using a sputtering technique prior to the <b>aluminising</b> process. The pack used in this platinum modified aluminide process was a standard <b>aluminising</b> pack. The performance of these modified coatings during oxidation and high temperature corrosion was evaluated. Promising results were obtained, which demonstrated that both platinum and yttrium modified aluminide coatings had beneficial effects on the oxidation performance of the coatings compared to the standard aluminide coating. However, they were found to work in different ways, to improve resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion resistance. The platinum modified aluminide extends the later stage of the coating life by reduces the amount of spall, whist yttrium modified aluminide reducing the amount of spall in the early stage of the coating life and increases the critical oxide thickness before the onset of spallation. From these results, the production of a combined platinum-yttrium modified aluminide coating would be expected to show improved oxidation and hot corrosion resistance throughout the life of the coating. This could be another direction for future work...|$|E

40|$|Cylinder {{expansion}} {{tests have}} been made in order to measure the working capacity of commercial explosives under standardized but realistic conditions. Copper tubes, O 110 / 100 mm diameter, filled with ANFO or bulk emulsion explosives were detonated, the VOD and the tube wall expansion measured. From this the work capacity in terms of the Gurney energy EG, i. e. kinetic energy of tube and explosive gases, was calculated. Pure ANFO gave values of 1. 6 - 1. 9 MJ/kg, <b>aluminised</b> ANFO 2. 5 MJ/kg and bulk emulsion 1. 5 - 2. 3 MJ/kg depending on the density. The explosive energy transfer is basically over at a volume expansion ratio of 5 - 10, but the <b>aluminised</b> ANFO keeps doing work much longer. Compared with their explosion energies however, the ANFO explosives transferred only 40 - 50 % of the available energy but the emulsion 60 - 70 % at normal densities. At densities above 1200 kg/m 3, the VOD of the emulsions tends to drop off but the work capacity continues to increase. It is best described as a linearly increasing function with density. The case is finally made that the cylinder test is a better way to emulate rock-blasting conditions than the underwater test. It stops doing work at a relevant expansion ratio of the blast fumes and it has a reasonable balance between the different energies that accompany the blasting process.
