5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time.

When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt <b>a</b> <b>sole</b> national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E
