5|$|As {{early as}} 1857, {{the need for}} a {{lighthouse}} on Point Stephens was identified, due to the proximity to the entrance of Port Stephens, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of the local coastline to ships. Another reason was that mariners were mistaking the entrance to Fingal Bay for that of Port Stephens. At least twenty four vessels are known to have been wrecked in the area. the most serious being the Dove in 1828 with the loss of seven lives, and the Pandora in 1836 with five lives. Another notable wreck was the Florence Irving in 1877.|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E

5|$|To {{convince}} {{the rest of}} the colony, Peter and Thea plan to use a piece of mythology, that a dog with four white paws would be supposedly born {{when it was time to}} leave. Such a dog had been born several days ago but has yet to open his eyes. Thea decides to proceed without using the dog and tries to {{convince the}} colony at a reenactment of the Settler's escape to Greenland with several allies who know of Rowen's actions. Just as Thea and her allies are about to lose the argument, Peter arrives with the dog, whose eyes are open. That, coupled with the fact that Peter is an eye adept, the first in a hundred years, convinces the colony to listen to Thea instead of Rowen. The novel ends eight months later as the people of Gracehope are slowly educated on global warming <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of staying in their colony.|$|E
5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby {{in a position where}} she was able to protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

25|$|Synthesis of the {{chemical}} GHB was first reported in 1874 by Alexander Zaytsev, but the first major research into its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Dr. Henri Laborit to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA.

25|$|Among serpents and eels, {{snakes and}} lizards were also popular {{depictions of the}} god Atum. Serpents were seen as creatures of the earth that embody primeval, chthonic qualities, {{involved}} in the process of creation. Because many snakes inhabit marshes, they were closely linked to water and the primeval ocean of Nun. Egyptians were well aware of both the snake's usefulness in controlling vermin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> posed by its poison. Texts like the Brooklyn Papyrus include remedies and magical spells to cure the bitten. Snake deities were worshipped in hopes of preventing potential attacks by their earthly representatives. Commonly mummified in the Late, Ptolemaic, and Roman periods, lizards did not play much of a role in earlier culture.|$|E
25|$|King {{himself was}} {{suffering}} from alcoholism {{at the time he}} wrote the novel, therefore giving a strong autobiographical element to the story. He has expressed disappointment that his novel's important themes, such as the disintegration of family <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of alcoholism, are less prevalent in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would ultimately go mad, due to Nicholson's famous identification with the character of McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). King had suggested that a more “everyman”-like actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack's subsequent descent into madness would be more unnerving.|$|E

25|$|According to the Pali tradition, Maudgalyāyana 's death came in November of {{the same}} year as the Buddha's passing, when Maudgalyāyana was {{traveling}} in Magadha. He {{died at the age of}} eighty-four. Some accounts put forth that rivaling traditions stoned him to death, others say that those traditions hired robbers. The Pali tradition states that Jain monks persuaded a group of robbers led by a Samaṇa-guttaka to kill Maudgalyāyana, out of jealousy for his success. Maudgalyāyana would often teach about the visits he had made to heaven and hell, the fruits of leading a moral life, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> of leading an immoral life. These teachings made the number of followers from rivaling traditions decrease. Whoever killed Maudgalyāyana, the general consensus is that he was killed in a violent fashion at the Kālasilā Cave, on the Isigili Hill near Rājagaha, which might be equated with modern Udaya Hill.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their greater power, as well as lack of warning, {{positive}} lightning strikes are considerably more dangerous. Due to the aforementioned tendency for positive ground flashes to produce both high peak currents and long continuing current, they are capable of heating surfaces to much higher levels which increases the likelihood of a fire being ignited. At the present time, aircraft are not designed to withstand such strikes, since their existence was unknown at the time standards were set, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> unappreciated until the destruction of a glider in 1999. The standard in force {{at the time of the}} crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A, was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006, however it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated. Aircraft operating in U.S. airspace have been required to be equipped with static discharge wicks. Although their primary function is to mitigate radio interference due to static buildup through friction with the air, in the event of a lightning strike, a plane is designed to conduct the excess electricity through its skin and structure to the wicks to be safely discharged back into the atmosphere. These measures, however, may be insufficient for positive lightning.|$|E
