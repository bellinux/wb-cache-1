5|$|Reveton {{initially}} began spreading {{in various}} European countries in early 2012. Variants were localized with templates branded with the logos of different law enforcement organizations {{based on the}} user's country; for example, variants used in the United Kingdom contained the branding of {{organizations such as the}} Metropolitan Police Service and the Police National E-Crime Unit. Another version contained the logo of the royalty collection society PRS for Music, which specifically accused the user of illegally downloading music. In a statement warning the public about the malware, the Metropolitan Police clarified that they would never lock <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> such a way as part of an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Timoshenko and his partner, Officer Herman Yan, {{had been}} driving in a marked 71st precinct police car on a routine patrol in Crown Heights, with Timoshenko riding as the {{passenger}} when they spotted a 2003 black BMW sports utility vehicle headed westbound on Lefferts Avenue at 2:30 am. The officers scanned the BMW's license plate on <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> their police car. When the check came back, it indicated that the plate was assigned to a 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander, not the BMW. Timoshenko and Yan signaled for the vehicle to pull over, and the driver complied, turning north onto Rogers Avenue, where both officers got out of their car and approached the stopped vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The term {{theoretical}} chemistry may {{be defined}} as a mathematical description of chemistry, whereas computational chemistry is usually used when a mathematical method is sufficiently well developed that it can be automated for implementation on <b>a</b> <b>computer.</b> <b>In</b> theoretical chemistry, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians develop algorithms and computer programs to predict atomic and molecular properties and reaction paths for chemical reactions. Computational chemists, in contrast, may simply apply existing computer programs and methodologies to specific chemical questions.|$|E
25|$|The act {{requires}} that the gambler be at least 21 years old and play from <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> New Jersey.

Macquarie Capital estimates that online gambling will provide Atlantic City's casino with $260 to $400 million in additional revenue per year. The Casino Control Commission will create regulations for online gambling. It is unclear when online gambling licenses will be issued, or if there will be any legal challenges to the new law.|$|E
25|$|The control yokes also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|E

25|$|The {{term was}} coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. The {{most common type}} of CAPTCHA was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel: (1) Mark D. Lillibridge, Martin Abadi, Krishna Bharat, and Andrei Z. Broder; and (2) Eran Reshef, Gili Raanan and Eilon Solan. This form of CAPTCHA {{requires}} that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to the standard Turing test that is administered by a human, a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test.|$|E
25|$|This energy {{function}} only introduces probability biases {{for a spin}} having a value and {{for a pair of}} spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in <b>a</b> <b>computer,</b> <b>in</b> the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.|$|E
25|$|Whenever {{the laptop}} is powered on it can {{participate}} in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) with each node operating in a peer-to-peer fashion with other laptops it can hear, forwarding packets across the cloud. If <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> the cloud {{has access to the}} Internet—either directly or indirectly—then all computers in the cloud are able to share that access. The data rate across this network will not be high; however, similar networks, such as the store and forward Motoman project have supported email services to 1000 schoolchildren in Cambodia, according to Negroponte. The data rate should be sufficient for asynchronous network applications (such as email) to communicate outside the cloud; interactive uses, such as web browsing, or high-bandwidth applications, such as video streaming should be possible inside the cloud. The IP assignment for the meshed network is intended to be automatically configured, so no server administrator or an administration of IP addresses is needed.|$|E
