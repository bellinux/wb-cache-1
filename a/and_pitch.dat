The base and wing commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed the demonstration, but apparently took no action.|$|E
5|$|Their {{repertoire}} of vocalisations is also large; variations in intensity <b>and</b> <b>pitch,</b> rather than discrete signals, appear central to communication. Most lion vocals are variations of growling/snarling, miaowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include purring, puffing, bleating and humming. Lions tend to roar {{in a very}} characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off {{into a series of}} shorter ones.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. The Indian women's team played their first ODI match in 1978, against England, after the Women's Cricket Association of India was formed. The Women's Cricket Association of India was merged with the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2006 as part of the International Cricket Council's initiative to develop women's cricket.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the Gothenburg area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the Gothenburg teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E

5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{objectives}} involved {{evaluating the}} performance of the spacecraft over six orbits, as well as the effect of prolonged microgravity on the pilot. The specific spacecraft systems would also be evaluated and tested, and the worldwide tracking and communications network would be tested to see how well it would stand up in an extended mission. The flight control experiments included manually turning the spacecraft around, yaw <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> manoeuvres to determine {{how easy it was to}} control the spacecraft attitude, realignment of the onboard gyroscopes in flight, and leaving the spacecraft to drift on-orbit.|$|E

Bismarck and Tirpitz were initially armed with twelve 20mm guns in single mounts, though these were augmented over time. Bismarck received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20mm guns.

The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. Due to the sporting boycott placed upon their country, South Africa women did not contest their first ODI until August 1997, playing Ireland in Belfast. Later that year, South Africa entered the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. They went one better in 2000, reaching the semi-finals, but since then have finished seventh twice (2005 and 2009) and sixth (2013), before reaching the semi-finals once more in 2017. They were required to compete in a qualifying series to confirm their place in the 2009 (World Cup 2009 qualifier) and 2013 (World Cup 2013 qualifier) tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised Victorian style that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
5|$|On 14 October 1548 (13th waxing of Tazaungmon 910 ME), the Burmese three armies left Martaban {{to start}} the invasion. The armies marched along the Ataran river toward the Three Pagodas Pass, entered Siam along the Khwae Noi River {{to the town of}} Sai Yok, then {{overland}} towards the Khwae Yai River. From there they travelled by boat toward the town of Kanchanaburi. Tabinshwehti travelled in great state with a massive retinue of elephants and servants. Many of these elephants carried muskets and bronze cannon; these were kept close to the king. Royal elephants were rafted across rivers, while the ordinary war elephants marched upstream to a ford. The Burmese king was accompanied by his crown prince Bayinnaung, Bayinnaung's thirteen-year-old son Nanda, and many richly attired lords. Hundreds of workmen marched ahead of the king's retinue, to pitch a richly decorated wooden camp, painted and gilded for the King's use, only to pack it up <b>and</b> <b>pitch</b> it at a new location every day.|$|E

5|$|Rhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre {{of action}} game that {{challenges}} a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and music-based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero. Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player {{is required to}} press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm <b>and</b> <b>pitch,</b> {{in order to test}} a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll <b>and</b> <b>pitch),</b> and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
