Using genome-wide gene expression and binding analyses in Drosophila adults, we demonstrate that KDM 5 (Lid) is a direct regulator of genes required for mitochondrial structure and function.

Instead, it requires the PHD motif of KDM 5 that binds to histone H 3 that is di- or trimethylated on lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 2 / 3). Genome-wide, KDM 5 binding overlaps with the active chromatin mark H 3 K 4 me 3, and a fly strain specifically lacking H 3 K 4 me 2 / 3 binding shows defective KDM 5 promoter recruitment and gene activation. KDM 5 therefore plays a central role in regulating mitochondrial function by utilizing its ability to recognize specific chromatin contexts.

The precise {{role played by the}} various cell types of the lymphoid system in the maintenance or abrogation of this unresponsiveness to self remains unclear.

In a rabbit model, the cellular events in the termination of unresponsiveness to bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 by the injection of cross-reacting albumins, were best explained by assuming that the T cells, but not the B cells, were unresponsive to BSA and to cross-reacting determinants on other albumins (4).

40|$|Although {{the optic}} tectum in non-mammals and its {{mammalian}} homolog, the superior colliculus, {{are involved in}} avoidance behaviors, whether and how tectal neurons respond to an object approaching {{on a collision course}} towards the <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> unclear. Here we show by single unit recording that there exist three classes of looming-sensitive neurons in the pigeon tectal layer 13, which sends looming information to the nucleus rotundus or to the tectopontine system. The response onset time of tau cells is approximately constant whereas that for rho and eta cells depends on the square root of the diameter ⁄ velocity ratio of objects looming towards the animal, the cardioacceleration of which is also linearly related to the square root of this ratio. The receptive field of tectal cells is composed of an excitatory center and an inhibitory periphery, and this periphery does not inhibit responses to looming stimuli. These results suggest that three classes of tectal neurons are specified for detecting an object approaching on a collision course towards the animal, and that rho and eta cells may signal early warning of impending collision whereas tau cells initiate avoidance responses at a constant time before collision through the tectopontine system...|$|E

40|$|The Cambrian trace fossil Plagiogmus is {{the floor}} of a backfilled burrow which is common in the deltaic sediments of the Arumbera Sandstone in central Australia. The Plagiogmus forming organism/s was/were {{connected}} to the surface by a siphon that formed a longitudinal furrow. Collapse associated with the movement of the siphon through the sediment may have produced a variety of trace fossil morphologies similar to the ichnogenera Gordia, Cochlichnus and Taphrhelminthopsis. Other parts of the Plagiogmus burrow may be compared with Olivellites, Aulichnites, Laminites, Climactichnites and Psammichnites ispp. The distinctive transverse bars of the Plagiogmus structure are interpreted as being produced by a posterior sucker used by the animal during locomotion. It is interpreted that the burrow fill was composed solely of feeding wastes and not the spoils of tunnelling. The laminae within the backfill are not related to the transverse bars. Bilobed burrows overlying the Plagiogmus component are related to the presence of a siphon that we interpret to have been used in surface deposit feeding.

40|$|AbstractöThe hypocretins (orexins) are a newly identi¢ed peptide family {{comprised}} of two peptides, hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2. Recent observations suggest an involvement of these peptides {{in the regulation}} of behavioral state. For example, these peptides are found {{in a variety of}} brain regions associated with the regulation of forebrain neuronal and behavioral activity states. Furthermore, when infused into the lateral ventricles in awake animals, hypocretin- 1 elicits increased duration of waking beyond that observed in vehicle-treated animals. Previous studies have been limited to an examination of the sleep^wake e¡ects of hypocretin- 1 in awake animals. Currently, the sleep^wake e¡ects of hypocretin- 2 {{and the extent to which}} hypocretins can initiate waking in the sleeping <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> unclear. To better characterize the wake-promoting actions of the hypocretins, the current studies examined the sleep^wake e¡ects of varying doses (0. 007, 0. 07 and 0. 7 nmol) of hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2 when administered into sleeping rats (e. g. remote-controlled infusions). Infusions of hypocretin- 1 and hypocretin- 2 into the lateral ventricles elicited a short latency (0. 7 nmol hypocretin- 1; 93 þ 30 s from the start of the 120 -s infusion) increase in electroencephalographic, electromyographic, and behavioral indices of waking. These infusions also produced substantial decreases in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep. Hypocretin- 1 was more potent than hypocretin- 2 in these actions. Interestingly, hypocretin- 1 infused into the fourth ventricle elicited less robust waking which occurred with a longer latency than infusions into the lateral ventricles. These latter observations suggest a forebrain site of action participates in hypocretin- 1 -induced waking...|$|E
40|$|The {{guinea pig}} has been {{utilized}} {{as a model}} for studying infectious diseases because its reactions closely resemble those of humans biologically and immunologically. However, the cytokine responses in this <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> to be studied. Initially, we established a quantitative assay using a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to measure guinea pig gamma interferon (IFN-), interleukin- 12 (IL- 12), IL- 10, and transforming growth factor (TGF-) mRNA. By preparing primer-fluorogenic probe sets for these cytokines and standard RNA templates corresponding to the target sequence of each cytokine, we obtained linear standard curves essential for quantitative determination. In guinea pigs immunized by intradermal (i. d.) vaccination with the Tokyo strain of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (0. 1 mg) or else hyperimmunized with the same vaccine (10 mg) given intravenously (i. v.), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at 4 weeks showed an increase in IFN- mRNA expression in the latter but not the former animals. However, at week 10, IFN- mRNA expression was markedly elevated in PBMCs, spleen cells, and cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both the i. d. - and the i. v. -immunized animals, the level of expression being 10 times higher in the latter. In contrast, the expression levels of IL- 12 mRNA in PBMCs, spleen cells, and BAL cells were not enhanced in either group at 10 weeks postimmunization. The expression of IL- 10 and TGF- increased slightly only in PBMCs. Regardless of differences in the levels of cytokine responses, the magnitudes of the purified protein derivative of tuberculin...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundIntegrins are heterodimeric (αβ) transmembrane receptors for {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) ligands. Through interactions with molecular partners at cell junctions, {{they provide a}} connection between the ECM and the cytoskeleton and regulate many aspects of cell behavior. A number of integrin-associated molecules have been identified; however, in many cases, their function and role in the <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> to be clarified. ResultsWe have identified the Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), a member of the STE 20 /germinal center kinase (GCK) family, as a partner for the β 1 A integrin cytoplasmic domain. We find that NIK is expressed in the nervous system and other tissues in mouse embryos and colocalizes with actin and β 1 integrin in cellular protrusions in transfected cells. To demonstrate the functional significance of this interaction, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, since it has only one β (PAT- 3) integrin chain, two α (INA- 1 and PAT- 2) integrin chains, and a well-conserved NIK ortholog (MIG- 15). Using three methods, we show that reducing mig- 15 activity results in premature branching of commissures. A significant aggravation of this defect is observed when mig- 15 activity is compromised in a weak ina- 1 background. Neuronal-specific RNA interference against mig- 15 or pat- 3 leads to similar axonal defects, thus showing that both mig- 15 and pat- 3 act cell autonomously in neurons. Finally, we show a genetic interaction between mig- 15, ina- 1, and genes that encode Rac GTPases. ConclusionsUsing several models, we provide the first evidence that the kinase NIK and integrins interact in vitro and in vivo. This interaction is required for proper axonal navigation in C. elegans...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} 50 years, studies of {{receptive}} field properties in mammalian visual brain {{structures such as}} lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V 1) have suggested the existence of cell classes with unique functional response properties, and in visual cortex of many mammals these functional response properties show considerable spatial organization termed functional architecture. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in understanding the cellular mechanisms that underlie visual responses and plasticity in intact animals, and studies of individual neurons in brain slices have identified distinct cell classes {{on the basis of}} anatomical features, synaptic connectivity, or gene expression. However, the relationships between cell classes identified in studies of brain slices and those in the intact <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> largely unclear. Rodents offer many advantages for investigating these relationships, as they are appropriate {{for a wide variety of}} experimental techniques and genetically modified mice are relatively easy to obtain or produce. Unfortunately, a barrier to using these animals in vision research is a lack of understanding of the relationship of rodent visual systems to the visual systems in more commonly studied mammals such as carnivores and non-human primates. Here we review recent comparative studies of functional response properties in LGN and V 1 of a highly visual diurnal rodent, the gray squirrel. In the LGN, our data are consistent with the idea that all mammals have a class of LGN neurons that is sustained, another class that is transient, and a third class of more heterogeneous cells, but some response properties such as linearity of spatial summation, contrast gain, an...|$|E
40|$|Here we {{describe}} a combined microfluidic-micromagnetic cell separation device {{that has been}} developed to isolate, detect and culture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from whole blood, and demonstrate its utility using blood from mammary cancer-bearing mice. The device was fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane and contains a microfluidic architecture with a main channel and redundant 'double collection' channel lined by two rows of dead-end side chambers for tumor cell collection. The microdevice design was optimized using computational simulation to determine dimensions, magnetic forces and flow rates for cell isolation using epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) antibody-coated magnetic microbeads (2. 8 mu m diameter). Using this device, isolation efficiencies increased in a linear manner and reached efficiencies close to 90 % when only 2 to 80 breast cancer cells were spiked into a small volume (1. 0 mL) of blood taken from wild type mice. The high sensitivity visualization capabilities of the device also allowed detection of a single cell within one of its dead-end side chambers. When blood was removed from FVB C 3 (1) -SV 40 T-antigen mammary tumor-bearing transgenic mice {{at different stages of}} tumor progression, cells isolated in the device using anti-EpCAM-beads and magnetically collected within the dead-end side chambers, also stained positive for pan-cytokeratin-FITC and DAPI, negative for CD 45 -PerCP, and expressed SV 40 large T antigen, thus confirming their identity as CTCs. Using this isolation approach, we detected a time-dependent {{rise in the number of}} CTCs in blood of female transgenic mice, with a dramatic increase in the numbers of metastatic tumor cells appearing in the blood after 20 weeks when tumors transition to invasive carcinoma and exhibit increased growth of metastases in this model. Importantly, in contrast to previously described CTC isolation methods, breast tumor cells collected from a small volume of blood removed from a breast tumor-bearing <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> viable and they can be easily removed from these devices and expanded in culture for additional analytical studies or potential drug sensitivity testing. clos...|$|E

40|$|Molecular biology has {{provided}} new opportunities {{to understand better}} {{the functioning of the}} immune system and to exploit this information for the construction of specific antibodies against a wide variety of antigens including the pathogens of humans and animals. In spite of the economic importance of cattle, many aspects of the immunology of this <b>animal</b> <b>remain</b> uncharacterised and tools to understand better bovine infections are lacking. This project has addressed aspects of both issues. The bovine immunoglobulin (Ig) system resembles that of other domesticated mammals in some respects, but other properties (eg the length of the third antigen-binding region of the heavy chain) appear unique. The first area for investigation in this project was to characterise the bovine JH locus and to understand why Ig rearrangement apparently favours a single JH segment. PCR was used to recover JH sequence from genomic DNA, either from non-lymphoid tissues or lambda vectors isolated and studied by other investigators. A region of 3200 bp was characterised which included the DQ 52 segment, 6 JH segments and the heavy chain enhancer. The bovine DQ 52 sequence is longer than those of other species and differs in sequence from a common consensus. For the most part, the JH locus is homologous to that of the sheep. The sixth JH segment identified appears to undergo rearrangement and is expressed in a minority of cattle antibodies. However, none of the segments carried the sequence which is most commonly expressed in bovine Ig. To identify which segment participates in this process, sequence was recovered from the rearranged genomic DNA of isolated bovine B cells using PCR with primers against VH and JH regions. This implicated the rearrangement of the fourth JH segment in the formation of bovine Igs but as the sequence differed between germline and rearranged copies, it appears that a non-conventional process operates in cattle. It is proposed that a gene conversion event or modified rearrangement process introduces sequence to form the fourth framework region of bovine Ig which does not exist at the JH locus in the germline. The mechanism of this modification requires more investigation. The second part of this project aimed to construct a library of recombinant bovine Fab antibodies from the Ig repertoire of a calf vaccinated against Mannheimia haemolytica (previously named Pasteurella haemolyticd) ...|$|E
