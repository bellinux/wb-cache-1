5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities.

He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b> To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from the militants trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies seem to indicate that there were foreigners <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E
