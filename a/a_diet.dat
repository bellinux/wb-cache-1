40|$|Abstract only availableAn in vivo {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the efficacy of several adsorbent test products to ameliorate the toxic effects of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in chicks. Ninety day-old straight run chicks were purchased from a commercial hatchery, weighed, wing-banded, and assigned to floor pens. A completely randomized design was used with 10 chicks (chick was experimental unit) assigned to each of 9 dietary treatments from hatch to 28 days. The aflatoxin used for this study was supplied by Aspergillus parasiticus (NRRL- 2999) culture material (815 mg AFB 1 /kg). The dietary treatments included: 1) basal diet containing no AFB 1); 2) basal diet supplemented with 1. 5 mg AFB 1 /kg diet; 3) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 1; 4) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 2; 5) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 3; 6) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 4; 7) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 5; 8) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 6; and 9) <b>As</b> <b>diet</b> 2 plus Product 7. The addition of Products 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to AF diets did not prevent the reduction in body weight gain (BWG) due to AFB 1. Chicks fed diets containing Products 1 thru 6 all had lower BWG (P >. 05) compared with control chicks. Body weight gain of birds fed Product 7 was not significantly different (P >. 05) from the birds fed the positive control; however, it was also not significantly different (P >. 05) from birds fed AF B 1 alone. Relative liver weights were not affected by dietary treatments (P >. 05) and averaged 3. 06 g/ 100 g body weight across all treatments. Results {{of this study indicate that}} none of these products were effective in ameliorating the toxic effects of AFB 1. Louis Stokes Missouri Alliance for Minority Participatio...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) exhibits considerable variation across agrarian societies, whereas they are virtually absent in non-agrarian societies such as hunter-gatherer and horticultural societies. When looking for lifestyle factors which could promote CVD, it therefore seems logical {{to focus on}} the agrarian lifestyle and ways in which it departs from a non-agrarian lifestyle. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate the effect of <b>a</b> hunter-gatherer <b>diet</b> (also called Paleolithic diet) compared to agrarian diet in prevention of CVD. In paper I we reviewed evidence from epidemiology and evolutionary biology for a possible maladaptation of human satiety hormone leptin to agrarian diet. We found that leptin resistance hypothetically may be a sign of maladaptation to dietary cereals as staple food, and that lectins could be a cereal constituent with sufficient properties to cause leptin resistance. In paper II we experimentally studied the long-term effect of <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> compared to <b>a</b> cereal-based <b>diet</b> on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in domestic pigs. We found that <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> conferred higher insulin sensitivity, lower C-reactive protein and lower blood pressure than <b>a</b> cereal-based <b>diet.</b> In paper III and IV we experimentally studied the effect of <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> compared to <b>a</b> Mediterranean-like <b>diet</b> on risk factors for cardiovascular disease, satiety and leptin in individuals with ischaemic heart disease and either glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes. Paper III showed that <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> improved glucose tolerance more than <b>a</b> Mediterranean-like <b>diet,</b> and paper IV showed that <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> was more satiating per calorie than <b>a</b> Mediterranean-like <b>diet.</b> In conclusion, we have found beneficial effects of <b>a</b> Paleolithic <b>diet</b> on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and satiety...|$|R
