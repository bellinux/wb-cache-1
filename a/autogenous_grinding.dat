50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and <b>autogenous</b> <b>grinding</b> mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|E

40|$|Comminution {{test methods}} used within mineral {{processing}} have mainly {{been developed for}} selecting the most appropriate comminution technology for a given ore, designing a grinding circuit as well as sizing the equipment needed. Existing test methods usually require comparatively large sample amounts and are time-consuming to conduct. This makes comprehensive testing of ore comminution behavior – as required in the geometallurgical context – quite expensive. Currently the main interest {{in the conduct of}} comminution test lies in the determination of particle size reduction and related energy consumption by grindability test methods, which provide the necessary information about mill throughput. In this procedure mineral liberation is regarded as a fixed parameter due to missing this information in ore characterization as well as a lack of suitable comminution models. However, ignoring the connection between particle size and mineral liberation prevents the scheduling and controlling of the production process from being optimal. For these reasons new comminution tests need to be developed or alternatively the existing test methods need to be suited to geometallurgical testing where the aim is to map the variation of processing properties of an entire ore body. The objective of this research work is on the one hand to develop small-scale comminution test methods that allow linking comminution behavior and liberation characteristics to mineralogical parameters, {{and on the other hand}} establish a modeling framework including mineral liberation information. Within the first stage of the study the comminution of drill cores from Malmberget’s magnetite ore, classified by modal mineralogy and texture information, have been investigated. It was found that there is a direct correlation between the mechanical strength of the rock, as received from unconfined compressive or point load tests, and the crusher reduction ratio as a measure for crushability. However, a negative correlation was found between crushability and grindability for the same samples. The grindability showed inverse correlation with both magnetite grade and the magnetite’s mineral grain size. The preliminary conclusion is that modal mineralogy and micro-texture (grain size) can be used to quantitatively describe the ore comminution behavior although the applied fracture mechanism of the mill cannot be excluded. With crushed ore samples from Malmberget also grindability tests and mineral liberation analyses were conducted using laboratory tumbling mills of different size. Starting from the dimensions of the Bond ball mill a modified test method was developed where small size samples of approximately 220 g were pre-crushed and ground in a down-scaled one-stage grindability test. Down-scaling was done by keeping similar impact effects between the mills. Mill speed and grinding time were used for adjusting the number of fracture events in order to receive similar particle size distributions and specific grinding energy when decreasing mill size by the factor 1. 63. A detailed description of the novel geometallurgical comminution test (GCT) is given. With respect to ore crushability and <b>autogenous</b> and semiautogenous <b>grinding</b> (AG/SAG) also drop weight tests were conducted. For a more accurate and precise measurement of the energy transferred to the sample a novel instrumented drop weight was used. Initial tests with fractions of drill cores and pre-crushed ore particles showed that the simple energy calculation based on potential energy needs to be corrected. For the future work these tests will be extended to other ore types in order to investigate the effects of mineralogy and to include mineral liberation in comminution models suitable for geometallurgy.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a common {{mathematical}} and simulation platform for tumbling mills, {{a review of existing}} mechanistic models was made identifying the key aspects of grinding and slurry transport which are common to all tumbling mills. A mill model structure has been developed for all types of tumbling mills based on the population balance framework by incorporating breakage characteristics, slurry and solids transport, product classification and discharge, and energy consumption. A size-dependant breakage model developed by the JKMRC is applied. Transport is separated from breakage events and treated as a main sub-model in the new model structure. The model structure is based on dynamic time-stepping technique to enable dynamic simulation capability for non-steady-state simulation and control modelling.

40|$|Comminution is {{the oldest}} {{mechanical}} unit operation for size reduction ofsolid materials and {{an important step in}} many processes where raw materialsare converted into intermediate or final products. Limestone is self-sufficientmineral resource in Japan and has been using as a sample for grinding tests. Recently, a demand for fine or ultra-fine particles is increasing in manykinds of industries. The energy efficiency of comminution is very low and the energy requiredfor comminution increases with a decrease in feed or produced particle size. Research and development to find energy-saving comminution processes havebeen performed. Then, it is necessary to estimate the comminution energy. Bond had proposed Work Index and it {{is an important factor in}} designing comminutionprocesses and has been widely used. The measurement procedure ofWork Index is closely defined by JIS.

To this end extensive operating data were acquired on an industrial semi-autogenous milling circuit and a model was developed to explain the circuit responses to changes in input variables. This model represents the trends in the data fairly accurately and showed that: • When an excess o f slurry was present in Me load (i. e. more than the volume of the voids) a pool of slurry forms st the toe of the load. • The complexity of the power dependence on the variables describing the mill load defied dynamic modelling with toe limited knowledge avail- • The key parameters determining grinding efficiency vary constantly as the grinding environment is disturbed indicating a need for adaptive con- • The flow through the mili is adequately modelled by a single well mixed Itwasalso clear that maximisation of the power with respect to themass alone was insufficient, and that control of the feed dilution water rate is essential.

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} the material behaviour of ore inside a coarse ore stockpile by discrete element modelling. This is of importance since the stockpile is the last stage to control the size distribution of ore in the ore handling system before feeding the grinding circuit. An optimal size distribution is required for efficient grinding in an <b>autogenous</b> <b>grinding</b> (AG) mill. To investigate the material behaviour in the stockpile this work focussed on the flow mode inside the stockpile and the size distribution during discharge. The individual particle characteristics are important to apply in the modelling; hence the discrete element method is very well suited {{for this type of}} modelling due to its distinct particle character. In this work the discrete element package used is EDEM, which is a discrete element modelling package developed by the commercial company DEM Solutions. In order to study this aim, several measures in the modelling were taken. The size distribution was divided into the three important sizes, as they are determined by the AG mill. Fines are sized 30 mm, pebbles are 80 mm and coarse particles are 130 mm. A calibration of the parameters of these particles was carried out in order to acquire the correct bulk density, angle of repose and static wall friction of the material in the simulations. Furthermore, an effective simulation model was found by the application of two measures. Firstly, the use of a 3 D slice instead of a full 3 D simulation showed good results. The second measure was to simulate only coarse sized material to represent each of the particles sizes, which also proved to be very well applicable. Based on segregation mechanisms two different methods to fill the stockpile were determined; batch and mixed filling. The influence of these filling methods was simulated for different flow modes in order to review the impact on the discharged size distribution. It was found that the best suitable mill feed was obtained by batch filled stockpiles, especially since core flow was the expected flow mode. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} ratio between input and output rate has a significant impact on the size distribution at the discharge, since this ratio determines whether there is a ‘last-in, first-out’ system. High input rates result in heap formation, which leads to segregation of coarse sized material. Therefore, at a high input rate it is advised to feed finer material. Feeding of coarser material at moments with a low input rate result in a more optimal size discharge, then when this is done at moments with high input rate.

40|$|Comminution, or {{particle}} size reduction, involving crushing and grinding, {{is a highly}} energy intensive process. This {{is largely due to}} the prevailing use of tumbling mills for grinding, where the nature of the particle breakage process is unconstrained and random. This indiscriminate nature of breakage contributes to the inefficient use of energy and may not promote liberation of valuable minerals in the ore. It results in high energy consumption and the generation of critical size material and ultra fines, both of which are difficult to process. The total demand for minerals is increasing to meet the requirements of the developing world and beyond. As a result, large reserves of high grade ore deposits have already been depleted. This has seen the need to mine and process ever lower grade, more competent and finely disseminated ores at much higher throughputs and finer product sizes. The inefficient nature of the comminution process coupled with ore reserves of declining head grade and the imminent introduction of a carbon trading scheme, suggests that the long term viability of the mineral processing industry depends on developing new methods and strategies to improve the efficiency of all processes. This will facilitate higher throughput rates at lower energy consumption. This is particularly important for the comminution process, as it is the most energy intensive part of a mineral processing circuit. A review of the current comminution circuit design practices reveals a general view that the comminution circuit design process is complicated and inexact involving the consideration of many interacting factors. A trend has been the repeated design and installation of large, low capital cost and uncomplicated crushing and grinding circuits. These normally feature one or two stages of crushing, followed by one or two large tumbling mills and a single classification stage. For most new comminution circuits, the general configuration and layout are more similar than different, where the size of the tumbling mills are dictated by the target product size and the throughput rate. The methodology for energy efficient comminution circuit design presented in this thesis challenges the popular trend of large and generic comminution circuits. The methodology promotes a better understanding and use of the ore properties and options to reduce energy consumption, including: • The inclusion of pre-concentration techniques {{at the head of a}} comminution circuit. The purpose of pre-concentration is to remove coarse size liberated gangue from later stages of processing and energy intensive {{particle size}} reduction. The selection of pre-concentration techniques is based on inherent ore textures and ore properties at a large scale. • The use of more efficient comminution equipment and <b>autogenous</b> <b>grinding</b> techniques. Through the re-distribution of comminution energy in a comminution circuit, the generation of problematic size fractions such as critical size material and ultra fines can be minimised or even eliminated. This aids the overall efficiency of the comminution process and minimises power usage for the same throughput and product size. It also limits the consumption of grinding media and the associated embedded energy resulting from grinding media manufacture. • The selection of the coarsest possible target product size(s) for a comminution circuit. This is achieved by thorough analysis and understanding of mineral liberation data of a coarse stream in a comminution circuit and the options and methods available to separate composite valuable mineral bearing particles from mainly liberated gangue in the stream. When these energy efficient strategies are combined in the design and configuration of a comminution circuit, energy savings are likely to be significant. However, it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact on energy savings and circuit operation when all three energy efficient strategies feature in the design of a comminution circuit. Instead, studies in this thesis have shown that the use of just one these strategies in the design of a comminution circuit can: • Reduce the total energy consumption by up to 42 % (when compared to a conventional crushing and grinding circuit) through the use of more efficient comminution equipment and <b>autogenous</b> <b>grinding</b> techniques. This equates to grinding energy and grinding consumables savings in excess of $ 11 M per annum for a typical 5 Mtpa concentrator. It also can reduce the operating costs by up to a half. • Reduce the energy required for size reduction by 46 % when liberated non-sulphide gangue is removed from a coarse stream in the comminution circuit and from further size reduction. This opportunity is identified by the thorough examination of mineral liberation data of this stream. The rejection of gangue at this point in the comminution circuit can provide a saving of approximately $ 3. 5 m per year in total grinding costs. It is noted that these energy savings can be at the cost of greater capital cost investment and, some may say, increased operating complexity. Incorporating the energy efficient strategies in a design methodology for comminution circuits can have a few significant implications: • It can increase size and value of the resource being treated as the rejection of liberated gangue by pre-concentration can decrease the mine cut-off grade. • It can improve performance of downstream separation processes as less gangue is present in the feed and the feed size distribution is narrower, allowing for better separation efficiency. • It can reduce the consumption of grinding consumables and minimise the associated energy used it their manufacture. • It may require higher capital cost investment but this is likely to be off set by the reduced energy and grinding media consumption as well as increasing energy costs and the introduction of a carbon trading scheme. This thesis develops and demonstrates a methodology, or a conceptual framework, for comminution circuit design which links together energy efficient design strategies which can reduce all forms of energy consumption and their cost...|$|E
40|$|A Final ReportThe pellets {{produced}} by Minnesota taconite companies generally contain between 4. 0 and 7. 0 percent silica. These silica levels were established initially by the concentratability of the ore, that is, its response to closed circuit ball mill grinding and magnetic concentration. Those operations that had taconite {{that was easy}} to concentrate generally produced lower silica pellets. As processing technology improved and it became possible to achieve lower silica levels constraints imposed by the blast-furnace operation became limiting. These constraints related primarily to sulphur and alkali levels in the furnace which control both the volume and chemistry of the furnace slag. Because the trend in blast-furnace practice has been to move toward lower slag volumes, pellets with lower silica levels have become more desirable. Recent extensive installation of external hot metal desulphurization facilities at many steel works allows even lower slag volumes. The basic driving force to go to lower slag volumes is the cost and availability of high quality metallurgical grade coke and related environmental problems. The recent move to produce fluxed pellets has made lower pellet silica levels more attractive because of the lower palletizing costs related to both the lower flux addition and higher production rates with a lower silica content. A common target silica level in fluxed pellets is now about 4. 0 percent. A 4. 0 percent silica pellet requires a concentrate containing between 3. 7 and 3. 9 percent silica depending upon bentonite addition levels. This lower silica level has been accomplished in some plants {{by the use of}} fine screens, while other plants require the use of silica flotation. The lower silica level has been accomplished at a relatively small incremental cost, generally less than $ 0. 50 per ton. With increasing pressure from the blast furnaces for lower-silica pellets to reduce coke consumption, concentrate silica levels on the order of 3. 0 percent may be common in the future. In addition to the need to produce a lower silica blast-furnace feed, there is a potential need to produce even lower silica concentrates, below 3. 0 percent, as feed stock for direct steelmaking. Worldwide the current research emphasis is on the development of a coal-based direct-steelmaking process to replace the conventional two step, blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace, process. Most of the current prototype direct steel making processes would benefit from a lower silica feed. These low silica levels will require increasingly complex and expensive secondary treatment of normal magnetic concentrates which exceed the capability of current taconite processing flowsheets. The purpose of this test program is to establish the lower silica limits that can be achieved by current technology for various Minnesota taconites and gain a preliminary indication of the cost. Because the magnetite concentrates {{produced by}} different taconite plants range significantly in terms of their size-silica relationships the program included three different concentrate sources for evaluation. Major differences will exist between concentrates produced in a fully <b>autogenous</b> <b>grinding</b> system and those produced in a conventional rod mill-ball mill circuit in which the ball mills are closed with hydrocyclones and/or a combination of hydrocyclones and fine screens. There are also differences {{in the nature of the}} siliceous gangue minerals in the various operations. The concentrates from the western Mesabi range contain quartz and low- grade metamorphic iron silicates such as minnesotaite, stilpnomelane, and talc and iron carbonates. The concentrates from the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation contain high grade metamorphic iron silicates such as cummingtonite, grunerite, and fayalite as well as quartz. The type of gangue mineral greatly affects the ability to upgrade the concentrates by silica flotation. The purpose of this test program is to determine the lowest silica content that it is technically possible to produce from three different concentrate sources representing the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation (Erie), the unmetamorphosed central range produced in a rod mill and ball mill circuit (Minntac), and the unmetamorphosed western Mesabi produced in an autogenous milling circuit (Hibtac). Sufficient data were collected to allow preliminary cost estimates to be made at several silica levels. The cost estimates will be based on reagent consumption, regrind power and metal requirements, and iron recovery. This report contains all of the information obtained on the Erie samples. This includes the results of the initial characterization studies, basic bench scale beneficiation test results, pilot plant flotation data, and the results of the secondary and tertiary treatment of bulk flotation froth to improve overall iron recovery.
