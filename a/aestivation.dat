5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's <b>aestivation</b> hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Breathing air is {{primarily}} {{of use to}} fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that {{is little more than}} wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of <b>aestivation</b> (summertime hibernation) until water returns.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear facets of the teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of <b>aestivation,</b> when the animal did not fed. <b>Aestivation</b> also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E
5|$|Several genera of teleosts have {{independently}} developed air-breathing capabilities, {{and some}} have become amphibious. Some combtooth blennies emerge to feed on land, and freshwater eels are able to absorb oxygen through damp skin. Mudskippers can remain out of water for considerable periods, exchanging gases through skin and mucous membranes in the mouth and pharynx. Swamp eels have similar well-vascularised mouth-linings, and can remain out of water for days and go into a resting state (<b>aestivation)</b> in mud. The anabantoids have developed an accessory breathing structure known as the labyrinth organ on the first gill arch and this is used for respiration in air, and airbreathing catfish have a similar suprabranchial organ. Certain other catfish, such as the Loricariidae, are able to respire through air held in their digestive tracts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during <b>aestivation,</b> the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} aquatic {{habitats}} {{are used by}} different crocodilians. Some species are relatively more terrestrial and prefer swamps, ponds, and the edges of lakes, where they can bask {{in the sun and}} there is plenty of plant life supporting a diverse fauna. Others spend more time in the water and inhabit the lower stretches of rivers, mangrove swamps, and estuaries. These habitats also have a rich flora and provide plenty of food. The Asian gharials find the fish on which they feed in the pools and backwaters of swift rivers. South American dwarf caimans inhabit cool, fast-flowing streams, often near waterfalls, and other caimans live in warmer, turbid lakes and slow-moving rivers. The crocodiles are mainly river dwellers, and the Chinese alligator is found in slow-moving, turbid rivers flowing across China's floodplains. The American alligator is an adaptable species and inhabits swamps, rivers, or lakes with clear or turbid water. Climatic factors also affect crocodilians' distribution locally. During the dry season, caimans can be restricted to deep pools in rivers for several months; in the rainy season, much of the savannah in the Venezuelan llanos is flooded, and they disperse widely across the plain. Desert crocodiles in Mauritania have adapted to their arid environment by staying in caves or burrows in a state of <b>aestivation</b> during the driest periods. When it rains, the reptiles gather at gueltas.|$|E
25|$|Orthalicus reses reses snails {{are active}} mainly during the wet season, i.e. May through November, {{during which time}} breeding, feeding, and {{dispersal}} takes place. Dry periods (December through April) are spent in <b>aestivation,</b> during which time the snail forms a tight sealed barrier between the aperture and a tree trunk or branch. Snails secrete this mucus seal (an epiphragm) that cements their shell to a tree {{in order to protect}} them from desiccation during the dry period. Snails may come out of <b>aestivation</b> briefly to feed during dry-season rains, and also may go into <b>aestivation</b> during summer dry spells.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} mode (Johnson's third), {{migration}} takes place {{to a place}} of hibernation or <b>aestivation</b> where they undergo diapause and the same generation survives to return. The classic example is that of the nymphalid monarch butterfly (Danuas plexippus).|$|E
25|$|Keelbacks are oviparous. Mating {{is thought}} to take place during the <b>aestivation</b> period. Gravid females have been found from April to August and eggs are laid in {{underground}} holes from May to September. The snake lays a clutch of 5 to 10 pure white eggs. Females remain with eggs till they hatch. The young snakes are 13 to 17cm at birth and eat small frogs, tadpoles, fish, earthworms and insects.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, James Hopson redescribed a fragmentary heterodontosaur skull (UCL A100) {{found in}} South Africa that Thulborn had {{previously}} assigned to Lycorhinus angustidens. After showing that UCL A100 could {{not belong to}} L. angustidens but was instead more similar to UCL B54, Hopson erected a new genus to contain both specimens. The generic name Abrictosaurus (from the Greek αβρικτος/abriktos meaning 'wakeful' and σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard') refers to Hopson's disagreement with Thulborn's hypothesis that heterodontosaurids underwent periods of <b>aestivation</b> (hibernation during hot and/or dry seasons). The specific name was retained, creating the new binomial Abrictosaurus consors. Despite Hopson's renaming, Thulborn continued to consider Lycorhinus angustidens, Heterodontosaurus tucki, and Abrictosaurus consors to be three species of the genus Lycorhinus. Most paleontologists maintain all three genera separately, {{although there is no}} precise definition of a species or genus in paleontology.|$|E
500|$|Herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill, {{reported}} in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber [...] below the ground surface, [...] in diameter, [...] from a river. It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area, and receded. [...] It {{is not unusual}} for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents, and become trapped when water levels recede. [...] While <b>aestivation</b> is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers, laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure. However, no field manipulation has been performed. Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin's ability to aestivate, it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because they have the ability to breathe air. [...] Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure.|$|E
500|$|The {{nervous system}} is {{basically}} {{the same as in}} other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain. [...] The brain consists of equal parts, cerebrum, midbrain and cerebellum. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity {{in the rest of the}} body. The pineal body, known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and <b>aestivation</b> in amphibians.|$|E

6000|$|In {{numerous}} other cases we find modifications of structure, which are considered by botanists to be generally {{of a highly}} important nature, affecting {{only some of the}} flowers on the same plant, or occurring on distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions. As these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot have been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases, to any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only a few instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc., that I need not give examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the parts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals. The manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states that with some species of Mimulus, the <b>aestivation</b> is almost as frequently that of the Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which latter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following cases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with a single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same plant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries. In Helianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or tri-locular; and in H. mutabile, [...] "Une lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE, s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta." [...] In the flowers of Saponaria officinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and free central placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the southern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms which he did not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw them growing on the same bush; and he then adds, [...] "Voila donc dans un meme individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe verticale et tantot a un gynobase." ...|$|E
6000|$|I will here {{add a few}} {{remarks on}} the hybernation of animals {{in this part of}} South America. When we first arrived at Bahia Blanca, September 7th, 1832, we thought nature had granted {{scarcely}} a living creature to this sandy and dry country. By digging, however, in the ground, several insects, large spiders, and lizards were found in a half-torpid state. On the 15th, a few animals began to appear, and by the 18th (three days from the equinox), everything announced the commencement of spring. The plains were ornamented by the flowers of a pink wood-sorrel, wild peas, oenotherae, and geraniums; and the birds began to lay their eggs. Numerous Lamellicorn and Heteromerous insects, the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies, were slowly crawling about; while the lizard tribe, the constant inhabitants of a sandy soil, darted about in every direction. During the first eleven days, whilst nature was dormant, the mean temperature taken from observations made every two hours on board the [...] "Beagle," [...] was 51 degrees; {{and in the middle of}} the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 55 degrees. On the eleven succeeding days, in which all living things became so animated, the mean was 58 degrees, and the range in the middle of the day between sixty and seventy. Here then an increase of seven degrees in mean temperature, but a greater one of extreme heat, was sufficient to awake the functions of life. At Monte Video, from which we had just before sailed, in the twenty-three days included between the 26th of July and the 19th of August, the mean temperature from 276 observations was 58.4 degrees; the mean hottest day being 65.5 degrees, and the coldest 46 degrees. The lowest point to which the thermometer fell was 41.5 degrees, and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to 69 or 70 degrees. Yet with this high temperature, almost every beetle, several genera of spiders, snails, and land-shells, toads and lizards, were all lying torpid beneath stones. But we have seen that at Bahia Blanca, which is four degrees southward, and therefore with a climate only a very little colder, this same temperature, with a rather less extreme heat, was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings. This shows how nicely the stimulus required to arouse hybernating animals is governed by the usual climate of the district, and not by the absolute heat. It is well known that within the tropics the hybernation, or more properly <b>aestivation,</b> of animals is determined not by the temperature, but by the times of drought. Near Rio de Janeiro, I was at first surprised to observe that, a few days after some little depressions had been filled with water, they were peopled by numerous full-grown shells and beetles, which must have been lying dormant. Humboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been erected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened mud. He adds, [...] "The Indians often find enormous boas, which they call Uji, or water serpents, in the same lethargic state. To reanimate them, they must be irritated or wetted with water." ...|$|E

50|$|In South Africa, Nile {{crocodiles}} {{are more}} easily observed in winter because of the extensive amount of time they spend basking {{at this time of}} year. More time is spent in water in overcast, rainy or misty days. In the southern reaches of their range, as a response to dry, cool conditions that they cannot survive externally, crocodiles may dig and take refuge in tunnels and engage in <b>aestivation.</b> Pooley found in Royal Natal National Park that during <b>aestivation,</b> young crocodiles of 60 to 90 cm total length would dig tunnels averaging 1.2 to 1.8 m in depth for most, some tunnels measuring more than 2.7 m, the longest there being 3.65 m. Crocodiles in <b>aestivation</b> are totally lethargic, entering a state similar to animals who hibernate. Only the largest individuals engaging in <b>aestivation</b> would leave the burrow to sun on warmest days, otherwise these crocodiles rarely left their burrows. <b>Aestivation</b> has been recorded from the months of May to August.|$|E
