Skyriaus pradžioje, apžvelgsime nominalaus vadovo pareigų turinį, bei šiek tiek detaliau paanalizuosime tris direktorių pareigas, būtent pareigą vengti interesų konflikto, pareigą priimti nešališkus sprendimus ir pareigą skatinti sėkmingą bendrovės veiklą. Potencialūs konfliktai su kiekviena šių pareigų lengvai pastebimi realioje verslo aplinkoje, kurioje, kaip tikimasi, kad nominalus direktorius bent jau atsižvelgs į jį paskyrusio asmens interesus. Šiame skyriuje pademonstruosime, kad teisinė sistema pereina nuo absoliutistinio požiūrio, kai direktoriui apskritai nebuvo suteikiama teisė atsižvelgti į jį paskyrusio asmens interesus, prie požiūrio, kuomet direktoriui jau leidžiama paisyti šių išorinių interesų ir siekti jų bent jau esant bendrovės ir paskyrusio asmens interesų tapatumui. Tokiomis aplinkybėmis direktorių pareigą veikti bendrovės interesais nusveria pareiga ginti bendrovės kreditorių interesus. Tai užtraukia pasekmes nominaliesiems direktoriams, ypač tiems, kurie buvo paskirti akcininkų, kadangi tokiomis aplinkybėmis mažai tikėtina, jog direktoriaus pareigos kreditoriams bus suderinamos su jį paskyrusio asmens interesais. Antroje šio darbo dalyje bus analizuojami Lietuvos teisės aktuose įtvirtinti juridinio asmens valdymo organai, jų ypatumai. Juridiniai asmenys įgyja civilines teises, prisiima civilines pareigas ir jas įgyvendina per savo organus, kurie sudaromi ir viekia pagal įstatymus. Ši norma tiesiog apibrėžia, kad juridinio asmens organai vykdo juridinio asmens atstovavimo funkciją {{ex officio}} – be atskiro įgaliojimo. Bendrovės vadovas yra privalomas bet kurios bendrovės organas. Nesant juridinio asmens organų, atitinkamas susivienijimas net negalėtų būti juridinis asmuo, nes neturėtų vieno iš svarbiausių juridinio asmens požymių: galėjimo įgyti teises ir pareigas savo vardu bei tam tikros organų sistemos (organizacinio vieningumo). Įmonių valdymas apima valdymo bei kontrolės sistemą, vadovybės, valdybos, akcininkų ir kitų suinteresuotųjų asmenų santykių visumą. Trečioje darbo dalyje analizuojama nominalaus vadovo sąvoka Lietuvoje, bei kodėl gi yra skiriami į vadovo pareigas nominalus vadovai. Verslo praktikoje egzistuoja tokie atvejai, kai į bendrovės vadovo pareigas paskiriamas fiktyvus direktorius, kurio pagrindinė funkcija yra neteisėti veiksmai. Tikrieji naudų gavėjai dažnais atvejais paskyria asocialius asmenys įmonių vadovais, siekdami išsaugoti bendrovių turtą bei išvengti mokesčių valstybei.,,Asocialūs“ asmenys būdami fiktyviais juridinių asmenų vadovais neatlieka jokių vadovavimo funkcijų, nepasirašo su įmonės veiklą sudarytų sutarčių, nevykdo kasdienės įmonės veiklos, neskiria bei neatleidžia įmonės darbuotojų. Lietuvos Aukščiausiajam Teismui suformulavus taisyklę, kad įmonės vadovo (vienasmenio ar kolegialaus) civilinė atsakomybė gali atsirasti tiek įmonei, kai įmonės vadovas veikia priešingai įmonės interesams, tiek ir tretiesiems asmenims, kai įmonės vadovas pažeidžia apribojimus, nustačius tam tikras trečiųjų asmenų teisių apsaugos garantijas. This work {{describes}} the deals and {{the analysis of}} the nominal head of the legal relationship between foreign countries and Lithuania. In the beginning of this chapter, before analyzing the legal system's response to the complex conflict between the reality of the business environment and the legal obligations, let‘s review the responsibilities of the Director of nominal content, which is likely to be damaged by the nominee director. In the first chapter we‘ll have a little more detailed analysis of the three director positions, especially the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, the duty to exercise independent judgment and the duty to promote the success of the company's activities. Potential conflicts with each of those obligations clearly visible in a real business environment, in which, as expected, at least {{to take into account the}} interests of the appointing person. In this section we will demonstrate that the legal system moves from an absolutist approach, when the head of a company was not entitled to take into account the interests of the appointing person, to an approach in which the director has been allowed to heed these external interests and pursue them, at least having company‘s and his appointed person‘s interest in it. In such conditions, the director‘s approach to support company‘s interests outweights the posibility to defend it‘s creditor‘s interests. This entails consequences to nominal directors, especially to those who have been appointed by the shareholders, because in such conditions it is unlikely that the director's responsibilities to creditors will be compatible with the interests of the person, who appointed him. The idea of nominal heads became popular for loans opportunities, which are provided by financial institutions. Nominee Director – the director, who is appointed to be a person who represents his <b>appointer‘s</b> interests in the Board of Directors. He can be appointed by shareholder, creditor, or by any other joint owner. The director just signs the paperwork without considering if specific action meets the company‘s needs. Nominee director‘s and shareholder‘s coverage is in the agreement, which does not prohibit such agreements, or in the relevant laws, that are applicable to public financial institutions or bank. Nominee director and shareholder service is used to ensure the highest degree of confidentiality. The nominee director is expected to defend the interests of the financial institutions, of with he is. In the second part of this work we will analyze the entity of governing bodies and their features established by Lithuanian legislation. Legal persons acquire civil rights, assume civil duties and implement them through their institusions that are formed and are executed in accordance with the law. This rule simply defines that the legal personality bodies carries out legal person representation function of ex officio – without special authorization. CR 2. 82 Article 2 states that any legal person must have sole or collegial executive body and the entrys general meeting, if the corporation‘s legal entities and it‘s statute does not provide such management structure. Governing bodies may be established when the are more than one founder. Lithuanian companies may have even four-levels of management: Director (manager), the director‘s board, the supervisory board and the shareholders' meeting. The company‘s manager is the mandatory body of any company. The Lithuanian Supreme Court had to deal with person management organ significance repeatedly emphasized in its case time and again. One of the LSC (Lithuanian Supreme Court) orders stated that without a body, a legal person generally can not exercise their rights or perforce their duties. In the absence of legal personality the respective bodies can not even be a legal person, because they would‘t have the most important legal personal attributes: the ability to acquire rights and obligations in its own name, and certain organ systems (organizational unity). It can be said in summary, that corporate governance includes both, the management and the control system, the management, board, shareholders and other stakeholders etnity. The head of the company is the binding body in any company. In case, if a company has a single-stage structure of management, the liability for the improper management functionality is implemented to the one, who is the single management body. If the company's management structure is multilevel, then the head of the company is one of many of subjects of responsibility. In practice, there are three main different legal person management system - one-tier, two-tier and mixed. Lithuania is attributed to countries with a mixed system. Lithuania does not have established pattern and formed management traditions, but it is compared to management models of German-type system of corporate governance model with a clear separated management functions. However, it could be argued that the legal person management - a system through which the legal entity is managed and controlled. The third part we analyze the nominal head‘s concept in Lithuania, who appoints them and what are the intentions of real beneficiaries to the designation what the designation are. The Republic of Lithuania Civil Code (CC) 2. 87, paragraph 7 states that a board of members of the body, defaulting or improperly carrying out the duties specified in the Civil Code or instruments of incorporation must obtain compensation legal entity entirely. LSC (Lithuanian Supreme Court) emphasizes that in such cases the participant acts as a figurehead and must take responsibility as a leader, a. e. it must be applied to the management bodies of civil liability standard...|$|R

Later, with the Ottoman constitution of 1876, a parliament was established to oversee the prime minister, and the prime minister formed a cabinet. With the amendments to the constitution during the Second Constitutional Era, the prime minister was made answerable to the parliament rather than the sultan.

50|$|Radical Islam has {{its roots}} in a sect of Islam called Kharijism, which came about around 600 CE when the third and fourth caliphs were murdered during the first civil war. The Kharijites no longer exist today, and it did not {{continue}} as a sect of Islam, but their beliefs laid the early groundwork for much of what Radical Islamists believe today. During the time of their existence the name was understood as anyone who rebelled against the caliph or their <b>appointer</b> ruler, but overtime the name came to denote anyone of Islamist beliefs, or “religiously motivated militants.” Much like the radical Islamists today, the Kharijites “gave themselves the right to judge who is a true believer of Islam and who is not.” Also the Kharijites would eventually split into various sects, “whose common denominator was their claim that believers had to denounce” any Muslim leader who did not follow the Quran. The ideals of Kharijism would continue to exist in the more modern sects that were formed, but the sect itself would not continue to exist like the Sunni or Shia.|$|E
5000|$|Proxy {{is defined}} by supreme courts as [...] "an {{authority}} or power to do a certain thing." [...] A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions. But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy. Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts {{within the scope of}} the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's acts, including his errors or mistakes. When the <b>appointer</b> sends his appointee to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and, hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy).|$|E
50|$|A proxy cannot vote {{when the}} {{principal}} himself is present and votes. He can vote {{only in the}} principal's absence. Where the authority conferred upon a proxy {{is limited to a}} designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective. A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a new call. A proxy's unauthorized acts may be ratified by his <b>appointer,</b> and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority. According to the weight of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time, notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable. The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares. And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person, or gives subsequent proxy. Hence, a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the time}} she retired from the Court in 1978, Muñoz-Palma had become identified, along with Claudio Teehankee, as a {{dissenter}} from rulings that affirmed the decrees and actions enforced by her <b>appointer,</b> President Ferdinand Marcos, during his martial law rule. As early as 1975, she had expressed skepticism that [...] "a referendum under martial rule can be of no far-reaching significance as it is accomplished under an atmosphere or climate of fear." [...] (Aquino v. COMELEC, G.R. No. L-40004, January 31, 1975, J. Muñoz-Palma, Separate Opinion [...] ) The following year, she voted against allowing Marcos the right to propose amendments to the Constitution by himself, and in doing so, ventured to call for the lifting of martial law itself. [...] In a later dissent, she added that [...] "under a martial law regime there is, undeniably, repression of certain rights and freedoms, and any opinion expressed would not pass the test of a free and untrammeled expression of {{the will of the}} people. That [...] "(M)artial law connotes power of the gun, meant coercion by the military, and compulsion and intimidation" [...] was so stated by President Ferdinand E.

[...] According to the Brahmajāla Sutta (DN.1), a Mahābrahmā is a being from the Ābhāsvara worlds who falls into a lower world through exhaustion of his merits and is reborn alone in the Brahma-world; forgetting his former existence, he imagines himself to have come into existence without cause. Note that even such a high-ranking deity has no intrinsic knowledge of the worlds above his own. Mahābrahmā is 1 [...] yojanas tall. His lifespan variously said to be 1 kalpa (Vibhajyavāda tradition) or 1 [...] kalpas long (Sarvāstivāda tradition), although it would seem that it could be no longer than [...] of a mahākalpa, i.e., all of the mahākalpa except for the , because that is the total length of time between the rebuilding of the lower world and its destruction.

5000|$|Kales {{published}} Unpopular Government in the United States in 1914 {{in opposition}} to {{a new class of}} political operatives whom Kales labeled [...] "politocrats." [...] Political party bosses in his native Cook County, Illinois had devised a reliable way to control the elections of candidates to office, including judges, through the invention of so-called 'bedsheet ballots.' A 'bedsheet ballot' was a lengthy election paper with long lists of candidates {{for a wide variety of}} offices to govern a heavily populated area, such as Chicago. Utilizing a combination of game theory and thought experiments, Kales asserted that ordinary voters could not be expected to cast a thoughtful ballot for or against each of the members of a long list of candidates. Kales demanded that his readers face the fact that in any purely [...] "elective" [...] system for the popular selection of judges, the judges would in fact be nominated by political bosses; and that a system of merit selection could actually improve the ties of responsibility between the judiciary and the voters. He set forth several elements necessary for the success of a merit-selection system, of which the principal one is that the person publicly responsible for the appointment should be a single high-profile individual directly elected by popular vote. Examples given were the offices of governor and chief justice. Kales further urged that the ultimate <b>appointer</b> be advised by a professional panel, selected by other judges or by the bar association of the state where the appointment is made.|$|E
50|$|In 1719 Nizam-ul-Mulk who {{had been}} <b>appointer</b> the {{governor}} of Malva by the Mughal Emperor rose against the Sayyid Brothers and marched to the Deccan. He {{was followed by a}} large force under Dilawar ‘Ali Khan, and another army advanced against him from Aurangabad, commanded by the acting viceroy, ‘Alam ‘Ali Khan. Nizam-ul-Mulk first encountered the former, and Dilawar ‘Ali Khan was defeated and killed in engagement at Ratanpur, sixteen kos from Burhanpur. ‘Alam Ali Khan was at Fardapur when news arrived of Husain ‘Ali Khan, who was advancing to his assistance from Agra. He preferred, however, to hazard a battle, and was defeated and killed Burhanpur on 1 August 1720. Nizam-ul-Mulk proceeded to Aurangabad, where he was joined by Mubariz Khan, the subadar of Hyderabad, and other officers.22 Nizam-ul-mulk now established himself firmly in the Deccan. Next year saw the downfall of the Sayyad brothers and elevation of Nizam-ul-mulk as prime minister of Moghal Empire.He took charge of his new post in 1722.1 But tired of court intrigues retired to the Deccan in 1724 when he crushed Mbariz Khan, the governor of Hyderabad in the battle of Sakharkherda which he later renamed Fatteh Kharda fought in October 1724.2 From this date the Nizam became virtually independent of Moghal power. In the next two years the Nizam consolidated his hold in the eastern parts of the province. His real enemies, however, were the Marathas who under the dynamic leadership of Peshva Bajirav were fast growing into an all-India power. In 1727 Nizam-ul-mulk opened his campaign against the Marathas. Bajirav,also made his preparations. He laid waste the district of Jalna in the cold season of 1727, and ‘Iwaz Khan with Asaf Jah’s advanced guard partially engaged him. The Marathas retired to Mahur, and then turned rapidly towards Aurangabad and made for Burhanpur followed by ‘Iwaz Khan and ‘Asaf Jah. After crossing the Ajanta ghat, Bajirav started off for Gujarat; while ‘Asaf Jah relieved Burhanpur, and returned to Aurangabad with the intention of advancing on Pune. ‘Asaf Jah went as far as Ahmadnagar, when Bajirav also returned in 1728, and crossing the Kasar Bari ghat, laid waste the talukas of Vaijapur and Gangapur. ‘Asaf Jah’s Maratha allies rendered him but little assistance, and he was much harassed by the enemy. There was also great scarcity of water. The Maratha forces surrounded him at Palkhed where a battle was fought in March 1728 and forced him to sign a treaty by which the Nizam agreed to acknowledge Shahu {{as the head of the}} Marathas, and as entitled to collect chauth and sardeshmuki in the Deccan. This treaty is a landmark in the history of the Nizams as the Marathas now obtained a full right to post their officers for the collection of chauth and sardeshmukhi in the territory of the Nizam.|$|E

The research also investigates, {{for the first time in}} the public sector, the relationship between audit fees and nonâ€“audit (consultancy) fees. Comparisons are also drawn between audit fees in the public and private sectors in an analysis of audit fees by industry. Despite some key similarities, the study shows that a number of differences exist between private and public sector audit fee models. In particular, we find no evidence of Big 6 (or midâ€“tier) auditor premiums, but we do find a significant negative relationship between audit and consultancy fees providing support for the 'knowledge spillâ€“over' hypothesis. In addition, the fees charged to trusts appear significantly lower than their private sector counterparts, despite trust auditors having additional duties to perform. Possible explanations for this finding are offered in the paper...|$|E
40|$|U članku se raspravlja o humanističkim ishodištima kulture renesansnih ljetnikovaca. Posebno se analizira Hektorovićev Tvrdalj koji se po svojoj arhitektonskoj koncepciji i idejnim pretpostavkama odvaja od istovremenih dubrovačkih ladanjskih sklopova. There is {{documentary}} evidence {{that at one}} time, in the surroundings of Dubrovnik, there stood around three hundred of Renaissance summer residences. This represents a cultural phenomenon of European importance, as Croatian art historians {{have been trying to}} show over the last four decades, from the pioneer studies by Cvito Fisković to Nada Grujić 2 ̆ 7 s newest synthesis of the subject. The author adds some fresh evidence to foster the ideas of Nada Grujić on the architecture of the Renaissance villas at Cavtat which were built to animate "that way of life which {{from the point of view}} of the 15 th and 16 th centuries seemed closest to the antique". To this purpose the Republic, after having reacquired it, divided the area of the ancient Epidaurum into 25 plots,distributing them among the aristocratic families of Dubrovnik on the model of the ancient parcelling applied for example in 1296 on the northern suburb of Dubrovnik - Prijeko - and, after 1370, on the western quarters of Ston. Yet, while in the older examples rows of houses were erected on such plots, this time noble villas appeared inside high curtain walls; this - according to the typology of Renaissance residential architecture- was a specific derivation from the Roman domus. The Cavtat villas are unique - as a planned settlement of Renaissance summer residences intentionally rebuilt on the site of the ruined classical city back to which Dubrovnik traces its origin. In the rest of Dalmatia the majority of residential-agricultural complexes included also protective and defensive functions. These were numerous castra and castelli in the surroundings of Split, Trogir, Šibenik and Zadar, mentioned as early as the 14 th and 15 th centuries in numerous documents of the Republic. To illustrate better this aspect of Renaissance country life,determined by the depressive historical reality of the 15 th and 16 th centuries, with the Turkish power on the neck that about that time definitely overcast the chain of ancient Dalmatian towns which, from 1420 on, recognized the Venetian sovereignty, after Ladislas of Naples sold them for 100. 000 ducats, author describes an authentic example of the kind, in order to explain the architectural consequences, as well as the notional premisses, which distinguish them from the contemporary villas of Dubrovnik. He describes Tvrdalj, a fortified summer residence of the eminent Renaissance Croatian poet Petar Hektorović, at Stari Grad on the island of Hvar. Indeed, it would be possible to interpret Tvrdalj as a literary work expressed in the medium of architecture. Tvrdalj is not only the poet 2 ̆ 7 s lifework, it is also one of the most intriguing projects in the history of Croatian architecture as well as an utterly original example in the European Renaissance architecture of villas, in the same way in which Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s Fishing and Fishermen 2 ̆ 7 s Conversation (Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje), as acomplex ecloga piscatoria, transcends the rigid framework of that literaryspecies. * It is a poem-epistle in which Hektorović in three parts depicts to Nečujam on the Island of Šolta, the village in which Marko Marulić, the most significant Croatian poet and a model for Hektorović, had earlier found shelter. Tvrdalj in fact combines these two architectural types- a fort and a villa-into a specifically designed fortified Renaissance villa with some unusual characteristics of a convent. In its central part, beneath the crenelated terrace, in a small room that is enclosed by all sides, although linked to the tower with the dovecot, lived a hermit- "pinzocchera" -a Franciscan woman of the Third Order ("a nun living in the outside world with a vow of chastity"). Within the complex there were edifices whose function was described by the inscriptions: PRO ITINERANTIBVS and PRO PAUPERIBVS. The rooms in the building which was called revelin were reserved for the poet 2 ̆ 7 s male and female servants and welcomed the poor. The fish pond holds a place for washing clothes open for the whole town. The entire complex had several dozens of inscriptions of which more than twenty have survived - mostly written in a moralising tone. The style, the graphic quality, and the spirit of the inscriptions seem to have developed in a similar way as the poet himself, and as the building of Tvrdalj advanced. However, some of the texts were created according to the same concept. The inscriptions in Tvrdalj belong to several parallel planes, partly overlapping creating a central core focused on eschatological matters related to the last things. A number of inscriptions directly identify houses of the complex, and specifically wells and water. The sea- the water- the rainwater, these are topics Hektorović is obsessed with. The associations are biblical, but also Horatian and Ovidian. Of special importance are inscriptions which tell us that the poet was occupied by contemporary scholastic explications of the dogma of the Immaculate conception. He was active in the current immaculatistic theological disputation and in those inscriptions he criticizes the "maculatists", mainly the Dominicans (who lived in his immediate vicinity). Finally, there is a series of inscriptions, both Latin and Croatian, expressing thoughts of direct warning of the last things and last moments, of the very Last Judgement. Hence, the image of Tvrdalj as a picturesque Renaissance site of relaxation changes essentially after we have noticed, at each turn on our way, with each new glance, the warnings and morals. Where did Hektorović get the idea to adorn the entire complex, both the inside and the outside, with so many inscriptions making them literally the sole architectural decoration, where his coat of arms can be found nowhere but on the stone table which was once set aside in the garden? Where did he get the idea of transforming the architecture into a place for memorizing moralistic warnings? It is a suggestive hypothesis that the poet 2 ̆ 7 s Tvrdalj represents a materialized example of ideal space meeting the standards of the Renaissance mnemonic theory and praxis, according to which the speaker learns to remember the sequence of paragraphs of his speech, as well as whole groups of sentences, according to rules for artificial, trained memorizing - by placing specific words or sentences in specific imaginary space. Anyhow, we do not know of a Renaissance ambiance so extensively and so densely crowded with written messages, invectives, maxims. In the very center of the complex of Tvrdalj, beneath the fortified terrace (which we have recently freed from the 19 th century additions), in a small room there lived a hermit nun Lucija, the daughter of Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s mason Stjepan Ključeta. On the ground-story of that building, adjoining the central tower, on the very axis of the entire complex, beneath Lucija 2 ̆ 7 s little chamber, chickens were kept. Petar 2 ̆ 7 s ideas that so clearly unfold from his will, from his epistles, from the Ribanje and from the very architecture that crowns his complete work, may undergo various interpretations. But, if we look closely into the heart of Tvrdalj, a suggestive story is revealed: alongside the gardens full of luxuriant and rare plants (the poet Naljesković from Dubrovnik sends him cypresses,oleanders [...] .) lies a fishpond with grey mullets that presumably were not eaten, but intended to please the eye, and regarded as one of the symbolic attributes of the entire complex. On the ground-story was the henhouse, on the second story Lucija, in the tower the sparrow-roost and the dovecot. Thus the complete structure of God 2 ̆ 7 s world is represented, ranging from plants, from creatures that swim, those that walk, to those that fly. All this lies behind the facade of the fortified building, which bears a monumental inscription, truly the focal one, the largest and longest by its letters, the main dedication of the entire complex: OMNIVM CONDITORI To the Creator of All. Peter himself must have felt completely assimilated to that inscription, since he was the one who reclaimed Tvrdalj from the sea and marsh. An inscription from the facade (which is now lost, but was still seen by Ljubić) reads: OPVS IN MARI TOTVM (The whole edifice is in the sea). The cove with the little harbor was filled up less than 100 years ago. Yet, Petar had already done "such an exhausting work to drain the littoral", to erect walls on the coast, to reclaim land from marshes, to replace the reed with the oleander. Hektorović obviously saw himself as a specific archetype of the Creator himself. This is not an exaggeration. In the center of the western wall of the fishpond, the basic attributes of the Creator (two pairs of compasses, Fortuna 2 ̆ 7 s wheel, the Sun and the Moon) are carved out in relief. It is that same Creator who is mentioned in the well-known sequence of syntagms as Deus geometres, Deus artifex or opifex, aedificator or architectus, fabricator. Below the relief, Hektorović identifies himself with the inscription: CONNVENTIBUSVIRTVTE ET GENIO F(ECIT). (Built with common approval of Virtue and Genius). Through the metaphor of God as artist and the World as a work of art, through medieval platonism, through Augustine and Boethius(Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s favourite writers) we come to the poet 2 ̆ 7 s time and to his principles. In medieval iconography the representations of Deus-artifex, the creator and <b>appointer</b> of the life`s vertical axis that we have discovered in the centre of Tvrdalj, disappear in the 15 th century, but continue to be present in the literary tradition of the Renaissance and Baroque. This whole interpretation of Tvrdalj may seem too literary. In the rusticated walls of the unfinished small fortress in the south-west corner of the complex, in the architectural ascetism of the fishpond, in the combination of Gothic and Renaissance shapes, we may perhaps search for mannerist elements, since we are already in the time of the Council of Trent, right in the first half of the 16 th century. But, in many ways Tvrdalj stands out. It is a pure literary concept materialized in space. Tvrdalj, built to the poet 2 ̆ 7 s own design is Cistercian by its ascetic tone, without grotesqueries, festoons, or any kind of decorations. In the ground plan and elevation there are no traces of all 2 ̆ 7 antica forms of that period. In this space which is more picturesque than beautiful, which is concentrated and compartmentalized in a Gothic manner, in an essentially didactic and inelegant ambiance, in a sort of sub divo classroom, scenic surprises of Italian gardens are inconceivable. The whole system of Hektorović 2 ̆ 7 s thoughts is condensed in the inscription on his stone table (the only one in Italian) : FEDE E REA LTÀ, o QVANTOEBELLA (Faith and reality, how beautiful they are). That inscription completes the linguistic triangle of Croatian Renaissance Humanism in a fitting way: inscriptions in Croatian are found in the exterior of Tvrdalj, intended for the poet 2 ̆ 7 s milieu; the above-mentioned Italian inscription is carved into the table in the garden where the poet together with his friends enjoyed summer refreshments; the Latin ones are present in the entire complex. Tvrdalj as we see it is a complete setting. With all reason Petar says that Tvrdalj has "adopted" him...|$|E
