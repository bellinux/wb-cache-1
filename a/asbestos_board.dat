Now open space, the courtyard was initially used for dressing rooms, built with numerous cabana-shaped lockers, along with shower facilities. The western courtyard was for women, while the eastern court was for men. There were 500 changing rooms, containing 8,100 individual lockers. Of these, 5,400 lockers were located in the men's section, while the women's quarters held 2,700. The capacity was later increased to 10,000 during the 1936-1937 expansion, with 6,000 men's lockers and 4,000 women's lockers. The changing rooms were constructed of <b>asbestos</b> <b>board,</b> while the showers were tile with stone trim.

The facilities were built in 1950 as part of the KE Reactor complex and constructed within 400 meters of the Columbia River, which is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest and by volume the fourth largest river in the United States. The basin, located adjacent to the reactor, was used for the underwater storage of irradiated nuclear fuel discharged from the reactor. The basin was covered by a superstructure comprising steel columns and beams, concrete, and cement <b>asbestos</b> <b>board</b> (CAB) siding. The project's mission was to complete demolition of the structure over the K East basin within six months of tumover from facility deactivation activities. The demolition project team implemented open-air demolition techniques to demolish the facility to slab-on-grade. Several innovative techniques were used to control contamination and maintain contamination control within the confines of the demolition exclusion zone. The techniques, which focused on a defense-in-depth approach, included spraying fixatives on interior and exterior surfaces before demolition began; applying fixatives; misting using a fine spray of water during demolition; and demolishing the facility systematically. Another innovation that aided demolition was to demolish the building with the non-friable CAB remaining in place. The CAB siding covered the exterior of the building, portions of the interior walls, and was an integral part of the multiple layered roof. The project evaluated the risks involved in removing the CAB material in a radiologically contaminated environment and determined that radiological dose rates and exposure to radiological contamination and industrial hazards would be significantly reduced by removing the CAB during demolition using heavy equipment. The ability to perform this demolition safely and without spreading contamination (radiological or asbestos) demonstrates that similar open-air demolition ofcontaminated structures can be performed successfully...|$|E

The investigation was carried out at storage simulation and by using various packaging material. In addition to well-known packaging material, such as paper 2 and 4 -layer bags, jute bags, and PPR bags, the seed was also packed in the PVC transparent and PVC black bags, as well as in bags made of Aluminium foil.

They prohibit the import, supply and use {{of all types of}} asbestos and also continue to ban the second hand use of asbestos products such as <b>asbestos</b> <b>boards</b> and tiles. The regulations require mandatory training to be given to anyone who may be exposed to asbestos whilst at work. This regulation will enable contracted workers on site to assess correctly the nature of a material before work is carried out, thus eliminating the risk of uncontrolled damage to Asbestos Containing Materials. Maintenance workers who may be coming onto a premises to carry out a job must also be given training. [...] Should work need to be carried out that may result in the disturbing of asbestos then all measures should be taken to limit the exposure to asbestos fibres. Any exposure to those fibres should be below the 'airborne exposure limit' of 0.1 fibres per cm³. [...] The control limit is the maximum concentration of asbestos fibres in the air if measured over any continuous 4 hour period. Any short term exposure to asbestos, as measured by continuous exposure over 10 minutes, should not exceed 0.6 fibres per cm³. These exposures must be strictly controlled with respiratory protective equipment if exposure can be reduced in no other way. [...] In terms of asbestos removal, any work should be carried out by a licensed contractor although any decision as to whether work is 'licensable' is based on the risk. Anyone working on asbestos under the regulations must have a license issued by the Health and Safety Executive.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{asbestos}} fibres in construction products has been banned in European countries for about two decades due to its effect on human health. At present, many developing countries use <b>asbestos</b> cement <b>board</b> {{as one of the}} most important construction products for roofing, cladding and partition walls. The Hatschek process is the most commonly used method to produce <b>asbestos</b> Fibre Cement <b>Board</b> (FCB). There are two major problems for the asbestos FCB manufacturers in replacing their products with non-asbestos FCB. The first one is finding materials and fibres that are available and competitive in price compared to asbestos fibres, and the second is providing inexpensive machines and equipment to produce non-asbestos FCB. In this research, an effort has been made to solve these two major problems. After the initial laboratory investigations on several natural and synthetic fibres some of the fibres with potential use in FCB were chosen for the further investigations. A slurry vacuum dewatering process was then designed and made for the laboratory use. The performance of material selections and mix designs selected from the laboratory studies were subsequently verified with factory Hatschek process in a factory site trial. Many specimens with natural and synthetic fibres incorporating silica fume and limestone powder were made and tested in the laboratory. Silica fume and limestone powder were used for enhancing flexural strength and suppression of alkalinity to reduce breakdown of the cellulose fibres. The results of mechanical, physical and II durability tests were analysed. The microstructure of the fibres and composites was also studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). At some stages, mix design optimization was carried out to gain the highest flexural strength. The most suitable mixes were chosen for the factory site trials. A number of full-scale non-asbestos trial boards were made successfully in an asbestos FCB factory and tested in accordance with the current national and international standards. The results indicated that the trial boards fulfilled the requirements of the relevant standards. Based on the outcome of this research, a combination of acrylic fibres and waste cardboard in a mix incorporating silica fume and limestone powder in addition to Portland cement can be used to replace asbestos fibres. Although broadly compatible with the asbestos cement production process, this formulation change will necessitate some changes to the existing production lines in asbestos cement factories to produce non-asbestos FCB...|$|R
