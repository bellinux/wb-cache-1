40|$|Purpose: Extreme hot environments are {{prevalent}} in many occupational settings, and facilities management workers are no exception. Wearing suitable cooling garment {{is a useful}} means to alleviate heat strain and improving performance at heat exposure. This paper aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and applicability of the cooling vest across four selected fields (i. e. construction, outdoor cleaning and horticulture, kitchen work and work involved manual handling at the airport) and identify the shortcomings of the cooling vest used by the participating workers. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a two-phase design: a quantitative questionnaire survey followed by qualitative in-depth interviews. Findings: A remarkable physical strain alleviation (PSA) of 21. 1 per cent (14. 8 per cent in construction, 18. 8 per cent in horticulture and cleaning, 27. 4 per cent in kitchen and catering and 26. 5 per cent in airport <b>apron</b> <b>service)</b> is achieved by the use of cooling vest in four industries. Despite the success of PSA, several shortcomings of the cooling vest were identified: easily stained color, heavy weight, short cooling time, inflexibility that presents a hazard around moving equipment, lack of industry-specific design, nondurable and thick fabric with poor permeability. Originality/value: The findings of the current study do not only confirm the effectiveness of the cooling vest in alleviating heat strain and physical strain but also identify the major shortcomings upon which further improvements can be made.

40|$|Purpose – The Hong Kong {{government}} agencies launched a “Cooling Vest Promotion Pilot Scheme” across four industries, namely, construction, horticulture and cleaning, airport <b>apron</b> <b>services,</b> and kitchen and catering industries in 2013. A follow-up questionnaire survey regarding this innovative heat stress controlling measure {{was administered to}} evaluate its applicability to these industries. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The questionnaire surveys were separately administered to frontline workers and management staff. A total of 232 workers from the four industries participated in the full-scale questionnaire survey (A), which aimed to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of cooling vests, worker satisfaction, and willingness to wear cooling vests. The survey was also geared toward eliciting the comments of the workers regarding logistics-related issues. A total of 100 members of the management staff across the four industries participated in the questionnaire survey (B), which aimed to solicit their feedback about the Pilot Scheme and the logistic arrangements for using cooling vests. Findings – On {{the basis of the}} survey results, a systems model was established. The model revealed that the applicability of cooling vests mainly depends on the perceived benefits (i. e. worker satisfaction) and logistic costs. The results implied that the existing personal cooling vest failed to satisfy the workers’ needs and incurred potential logistic costs, which likely limited the broad application of cooling vests. Originality/value – The current study employed a systematics thinking approach and provided practical recommendations that could benefit industrial practitioners in the extensive application of an innovative heat stress precautionary measure.

40|$|Outdoor {{workers are}} at high risk of {{suffering}} from heat-related illness when they are exposed to a hot and humid environment under prolonged working time. Providing suitable cooling vests for these workers might help alleviate heat stress during summer time. However, whether workers are willing to wear cooling vests is still uncertain because of various personal preferences. To understand the determinants of worker preferences on two kinds of cooling vests, field studies were conducted in construction, horticulture and cleaning, and airport <b>apron</b> <b>services</b> industries, respectively. Workers were asked to rate 18 items of subjective attributes from a self-administrated questionnaire. Based on 17 items of subjective attributes, workers revealed four underlying factors; namely, thermal comfort, usability, tactile comfort, and fabric hand (feel), as the underlying factors affecting their preference. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted between the four underlying factors derived from factor analysis and one dependent variable 'dislike-like' to find out the reasons why horticultural and cleaning workers preferred one type of cooling vest over the others. Results indicated that while male and female workers were influenced differently by different underlying factors, usability was the common and determining factor having the strongest correlation with their preference regardless of gender difference. Thermal comfort, tactile comfort, and fabric hand (feel) were also important factors affecting their preferences. However, the choices of male workers were influenced more by thermal comfort, whereas female workers paid more attention to tactile comfort and fabric hand (feel). Therefore, gender differences should be considered in designing and constructing suitable cooling vests. Institute of Textiles and ClothingDepartment of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation {{was driven by}} an inspiration to study how employees behave toward each other from an interactive perspective where all members of an organization are considered active contributors. Employeeship holds this perspective and acknowledges the importance of productive relationships. The objective of this dissertation is {{to contribute to the}} conceptual and methodological development of employeeship. The aims are further to construct and present the Employeeship-Leadership-Relationship Model (ELR) that visualizes the leadership, peer employee, and leader-follower perspectives of employeeship, to present and test two questionnaires by which the ELR Model is operationalized, and to study the behavioral factors of the ELR Model (i. e., vertical leadership behavior, horizontal peer employee behavior, and reciprocal congruent leader-follower behavior) relative to psychological climate. Three studies were conducted of which two were empirical and carried out at Stockholm-Arlanda airport in Sweden. The first empirical study included the <b>apron</b> and passenger <b>services</b> of a ground handling company, tower and ground control of air traffic service, and an airline’s operation division. The second empirical study included the same divisions of the ground handling company and the ground control of air traffic service. The psychological climate was measured with the Creative Climate Questionnaire (CCQ; Ekvall, 1990), the leadership behavior with a modified version (Holmkvist, 2000) of the Leader Effectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD; Hersey & Blanchard, 1988), the peer employee behavior with the Your Employeeship Questionnaire (YEQ; Appendix B), and the congruent leader-follower behavior was computed based on the responses from corresponding items of the LEAD and YEQ. In the first study (Paper I) employeeship was contextualized relative to other established organizational concepts. The study further contributed to the conceptualization of employeeship and defined it as the behavior that constitutes the dynamic process of mutual work relationships between two or more employees based on task and social abilities. The study also presented the ELR Model, suitable methods to collect data, and research questions to test the model followed by a discussion of possible strengths and shortcomings. The main concluding remark was that the ELR Model covers the hierarchical perspective of top-down driven leadership, the horizontal perspective of peer employee, and the reciprocal perspective of leader-follower behaviors {{to be included in the}} same analysis. The purposes of the first empirical study (Paper II) were to test the ELR Model, the YEQ, and the combination of the LEAD and YEQ. To do so it was hypothesized that the three factors of the ELR Model correlated with selected psychological climate dimensions with which employeeship shares some con¬ceptually central components. It was further hypothesized that congruent leader-follower behavior augmented the value of leadership behavior and its positive correlation with the climate dimensions. The results showed that: 1) there is a relation between the ELR Model’s three factors and the psychological climate, 2) the YEQ measures behaviors relevant to the ELR Model, and 3) congruent leader-follower behavior partly augments the importance of leadership behavior in explaining psychological climate. The second empirical study (Paper III) replicated the analyses of the first empirical study with an amended design that: 1) divided the factors of the ELR Model based on four situational dimensions: individual-success, individual-hardship, group-success, and group-hardship and 2) included follow-up data to determine if the results could be replicated. The aim was to perform a detailed investigation of the ELR Model in order to provide a more complete picture about its applicability. The question was whether the situational dimensions of leadership, peer employee, and congruent leader-follower behaviors were related to the psychological climate. The most important finding was that congruent leader-follower behavior is related to psychological climate with some variations between the situational dimensions. A hierarchical regression analyses also showed that congruent leader-follower behavior augments the importance of leadership behavior and its relationship to psychological climate. The results were partly supported in the follow-up study. The main conclusions were that congruent leader-follower behavior expands leadership beyond the traditional conceptions of formal leadership and subordination in organizational hierarchies, that organizations should use this finding in their training programs and include followers in leadership development, and that the ELR Model can facilitate the understanding of how employeeship works in different work situations where leaders and follower can learn how to support each other to reach congruent behavior...|$|R
