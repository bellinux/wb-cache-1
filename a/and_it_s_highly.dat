40|$|The Stardust Mission {{returned}} a large fraction of high-temperature, crystalline material that was radially transported {{from the inner}} solar system to the Kuiper Belt [1, 2]. The mineralogical diversity found in this single cometary collection points to an even greater number of source materials than most primitive chondrites. In particular, the type II olivine found in Wild 2 includes the three distinct Fe/Mn ratios found in the matrix and chondrules of carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) and unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (UOCs) [3]. We also find that low-Ca pyroxene is quite variable (approximately Fs 3 - 29) and is usually indistinguishable from CC, UOC, and EH 3 pyroxene as well. However, occasional olivine and pyroxene compositions are found in Wild 2 that are inconsistent with chondrites. The Stardust track 61 terminal particle (TP) is one such example and is the focus of this study. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> <b>highly</b> reduced forsterite <b>and</b> enstatite is consistent only with that in Aubrites, in which FeO is essentially absent from these phases (less than approximately 0. 1 wt. % FeO) [4]...|$|R
