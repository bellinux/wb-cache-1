40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis was carried out {{to contribute to the}} knowledge of the effects of substrate water availability or water activity (a) on fungal growth parameters and its implications in the preparationw of materials susceptible to biodeterioration. Fungi were isolated from soils of different ecological sites at a range of substrate aw levels controlled by sodium chloride (NaCl). Three groups of fungi were isolated : firstly, those isolated only at high a (aw <b>about</b> <b>0.</b> <b>997).</b> secondly, those isolated at high and decreasing aw (aw 0. 997 to 0. 85) and finally, those isolated at only decreased aw (aw O. 95 to 0. 80). From these isolations, test fungi were selected to study the effects of pH, temperature, exo-enzyme production and biocide efficacy at decreased aw levels, with glycerol and NaCl as a controlling solutes. The linear extension rates of the fungi increased at all test pH values near optimum a of growth. Test fungi of the Aspergillus glaucus group were found to be most resistant to low aw. Growth and survival of vegetative and fruiting bodies at elevated temperatures were enhanced {{with the addition of a}} controlling solutes. A. flavus, A. fumigatus displayed high heat resistance and A. amstelodami, A. versicolor and Penicillium citrinum displayed low heat resistance at high aw levels and vice versa at low aw levels. Amylase, lipase and protease activities were studied at lowered aw, using modifications of the test tube method of Raute 11 a and Cowling. Amylase and protease production in most xerophilic fungi ceased around 0. 80 aw, but lipase production in some xerophilic fungi, including A. glatlcus fungi, was up to and including 0. 70 aw with g 1 ycero 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{investigation}} was developed whereby {{the intensity of}} fluorescence was recorded as the density on a photographic plate; the wave length of the fluorescent light was recorded across the plate; and the wave length of the exciting light was recorded as the distance down on the plate. The method makes use of a monochromator and a spectrograph arranged so that the dispersion of one instrument is {{at right angles to}} the dispersion of the other. The visible part of the spectrum from the monochromator was not allowed to fall on the samples. The samples could easily and quickly be placed in position or removed. Thus before making the permanent photographic record, they were accessible to convenient visual observation as to intensity of fluorescence and wave length of ultraviolet producing the fluorescence. Samples were made and examined for the composition range extending from pure CaWO 4 to pure PbWO 4. Several interesting things were observed: The sum of the fluorescent light of all wave lengths excited by ultraviolet of all wave lengths passed through a broad maximum in the neighborhood of a mole fraction of 0. 02 PbW 04 as had been reported by other investigators. The sum of the fluorescent light was found to pass through a second maximum near pure PbWO 4. It was found that the distribution of fluorescent light in the visible spectrum changes with mole fraction of PbWO 4 and also to a less extent with the wave length of exciting light. As the mole fraction of PbW 04 is increased, the average wave length of the fluorescent light shifts toward the red— that is, the color changes from blue to a color which is more nearly white. As the wave length of the exciting light is increased, the average wave length of the fluorescence again shifts toward the longer wave lengths. The wave lengths of ultraviolet that excite fluorescence vary with the mole fraction. As the mole fraction of PbWO 4 in the samples is increased, longer wave lengths of ultraviolet are able to excite fluorescence. Thus the maximum fluorescence excited by a single wave length is in general not at the same composition as the maximum of total fluorescence. For example, the ultraviolet line at 312 mu does not show a maximum fluorescence at a mole fraction of 0. 02 but shows a very strong maximum at a mole fraction of <b>about</b> <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> PbWO 4. The fluorescence exhibited by samples prepared with a mole fraction of about 0. 999 was quite strong both by comparison with samples having a mole fraction of about 0. 02 and with the fluorescent powders actually used in fluorescent lights...|$|E

Compressibility factor was calculated with help of two equation of state – Van der Waals equation and Redlich‑Kwong equation. Constants a and b of both equations were calculated using geometric average of the constants of pure substances. On the basis of calculated data charts showing the dependence of compressibility factor and the pressure were created. These charts were created for temperatures 20 °C and 40 °C.

40|$|M. Sc. Alloying Cr with {{non-magnetic}} Ru, {{results in}} unusual magnetoelastic effects due to strong magnetic {{interactions with the}} lattice. In the low concentration region, Ru increases the Neél temperature TN due to the enhancement of the spin density wave (SDW). The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient (a) of Cr o. <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003 displays Invar behaviour within a small temperature region (7. -: 5 K) of the magnetic transition at TN 390 K). This alloy is of little practical use since the Invar behaviour is well above room temperature. Mo, which is isoelectronic with Cr, is known to vary {{the strength of the}} SDW in Cr without changing its basic nature. It reduces and broadens the magnetic transition at TN of Cr and its alloys. Therefore Mo seems to be suitable for tayloring the Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> R 110. 003 alloy system, reducing the temperature region, in which the Invar effects are observed, down to room temperature. The temperature dependence of the thermal expansion and of the elastic constants were measured for (Cr i _rMor) <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ruo. 003 and (Cri _yMoy) 0. 995 Ru 0. 005 in the temperature range between 77 K and 450 K so that the effects of Mo on the Invar behaviour of Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003 and on the magnetoelasticity in (Cr i„Moz) <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003 and (Cr i _yMoy) 0. 995 Ru 0. 005 could be studied. From the Invar-study we learn that although the addition of Mo to Cro. 997 Rno. 003 succesfully decreased the Neel temperature down to room temperature, it simultaneously increased the coefficient of thermal expansion to much larger values. We were therefore not successful in our effort to improve the Invar type properties of the Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> R 110. 003 alloy by the addition of Mo. Although the study was mainly focussed on tayloring the antiferromagnetic Invar Cr o. <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003 alloy with Mo, we also theoretically analysed the effects on the magnetoelasticity of Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003, in terms of the temperature dependences of the thermal expansion and elastic constants in (Cri_xMox) <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ruo. 003 and (Cri— yMoy) o. 99 sRuo. 00 s alloy systems when some of Cr atoms are replaced by those of Mo. In both Cr-Ru-Mo alloy systems, a(T) showed well defined anomalies with a minimum at the commensurate (C) SDW to paramagnetic (P) phase transition at TN and a maximum in the incommensurate (I) SDW-CSDW transition at T IC for x 0. 015, the CSDW state is completely suppressed and only the ISDW-P phase transition at TN is observed. The temperature dependence of the elastic constants in (Cri,M <b>0</b> x) o. <b>997</b> Ruo. 003 with x = 0. 015 and 0. 07 showed only the ISDW-P phase transition, while the alloy with x = 0. 007 showed both the CSDW-P at TN and a very small ISDW-CSDW transition at Ti. c. In general: Mo decreases the magnetic contributions to the volume and to the bulk modulus of Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ru <b>0.</b> 003 below TN. Mo completely suppresses the CSDW state of Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> R 11 <b>0.</b> 003. The (Cri„Mos) <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Ruo. 003 and (Cri _yMoy) 0. 995 Ru 0. 005 show a second order phase transition at TN. Hysteresis effects were observed in (Cri—xMox) o. 997 Ruo. 003 at the ISDW-CSDW phase transition implying a first order phase transition at T 1 c [...] The fact that the transitions at TN are of second order, together with the effect of Mo on Cr <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> R 110. 003 completely suppressing the CSDW state, make it possible to theoretically analyse the temperature dependence of the magnetic contributions to the thermal expansion and elastic constants of the (Cri_xMoz) o. 997 Ruo. 003 samples showing only the ISDW-P phase transition. From the application of the theories we learn that: There is a mutual dependence between the reduced temperature dependences of the magnetic contribution to volume expansivity, A i 3 (t) and to the bulk modulus, AB(t). A phenomenological thermodynamic model is found to define the temperature dependence of the magnetic contribution to the volume and to the bulk modulus quite well, for the samples showing no ISDW-CSDW, but only the ISDW-P phase transition, with an increase in temperature. The Griineisen parameters are defined reasonably well {{within the framework of the}} phenomenological approach of Fawcett and Alberts. The Mo atomic concentration dependence of the magnetic transition temperature was studied from the magnetic phase diagram of (Cri—xMos) o. 997 Ruo. 00 s alloys in terms of the two-band imperfect nesting model of Machida and Fujita. From the magnetic phase diagram: A magnetic triple point where the ISDW, CSDW and P states coexist can clearly be observed. The ISDW-CSDW, CSDW-P and ISDW-P transition boundaries were calculated. The theoretical model describes the ISDW-CSDW and CSDW-P boundaries reasonably well, while there is a significant deviation in the ISDW-P phase line which can probably be ascribed to the fact that impurity scattering effects are not incorporated into the theory...|$|R
40|$|A {{fractional}} dialysate collection {{method to}} estimate solute removal in continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Technical Note. BackgroundFractional direct dialysis quantification (fDDQ), whereby a known proportion of dialysate effluent is sampled, can reliably estimate total solute removal in intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). Our study {{aimed to develop}} and test the technique in continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). MethodsTwenty dialysate collections (mean duration 23. 5 hours, range 17. 25 to 26. 6) were performed in 12 patients on CVVHD. An infusion pump diverted 10 % of the total effluent volume to the fractional collection (fc), the remainder being channeled into the bulk collection (bc). Both fc and bc were collected on ice and assayed for urea nitrogen (UN) and creatinine (Cr). Actual solute removal (ASR) was calculated from the measured effluent volume and solute concentrations of the fc and bc. Estimated solute removal (ESR) was calculated from {{the product of the}} fc solute concentration and effluent volume. All fc/bc samples in 15 out of 20 collections underwent gram stain and aerobic/anaerobic culture. ResultsBland–Altman analyses suggested good agreement between ASR and ESR [absolute values of percentage differences: 95 % CI = 1. 73, 5. 17 % (UN); 1. 88, 4. 31 % (Cr) ]. Favorable concordance correlation coefficients confirmed this [rc = 0. 995 (UN), <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> (Cr) ] and were apparently unaffected by heavy pseudomonal growths in 4 out of 7 culture positive collections [rc = <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> (UN), <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> (Cr); culture negative (N = 8), rc = 0. 996 (UN), <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> Cr) ].

RESULTS: Excellent correlation between estimated and real weights (r = <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> for MRI, r = <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> for CT) was found. Putrefaction gas and venous air embolism led to an overestimation. Venous congestion and drowning caused higher estimated weights.

40|$|The key {{properties}} of microalgal biodiesel are largely {{determined by the}} composition of its fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). The gas chromatography (GC) based techniques for fatty acid analysis involve energy-intensive and time-consuming procedures and thus are less suitable for high-throughput screening applications. In the present study, a novel quantification method for microalgal fatty acids was established based on the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technique. The lyophilized cells of oleaginous Chlorella containing different contents of lipids were scanned by NIRS and their fatty acid profiles were determined by GC-MS. NIRS models were developed based on the chemometric correlation of the near-infrared spectra with fatty acid profiles in algal biomass. The optimized NIRS models showed excellent performances for predicting the contents of total fatty acids, C 16 : 0, C 18 : 0, C 18 : 1 and C 18 : 3, with the coefficient of determination (R 2) being <b>0.</b> 998, <b>0.</b> <b>997,</b> <b>0.</b> 989, 0. 991 and <b>0.</b> <b>997,</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract—This study {{investigated}} the use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and different packaging to extend the shelf life of Barbari flat bread. Three atmospheres including 70 %CO 2 and 30 %N 2, 50 % CO 2 and 50 %N 2 and a normal air as control were used. The bread samples were packaged in three type pouches. The shelf life was determined by appearance of mold and yeast (M +Y) in Barbari bread samples stored at 25 ± 1 °C and 38 ± 2 % relative humidity. The results showed {{that it is possible}} to prolong the shelf life of Barbari bread from four days to about 21 days by using modified atmosphere packaging with high carbon dioxide concentration and high-barrier laminated and vacuum bags packages. However, the hardness of samples kept in MAP increase significantly by increase of carbon dioxide concentration. The correlation coefficient (r) between headspace CO 2 concentration and hardness was <b>0.</b> <b>997,</b> <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> and <b>0.</b> 599 for A, B and C packaging respectively. High negative correlation coefficients were found between the crumb moisture and the hardness values in various packaging.

Twenty reference materials were used to draw calibration curves with the headspace solid–phase microextraction (HS–SPME) method. By calculating the calibration curves, obtaining the quantifications of each component, and determining the area ratio of mass numbers by diluting the reference materials of each substance, the coefficients of determination are {{shown to be a}} minimum of <b>0.</b> <b>997,</b> e. g., α–Pinene (R 2 = <b>0.</b> <b>997)</b> and β–Pinene (R 2 = 0. 998), and a high reproducibility is indicated. Detection and quantification limits are below 0. 07 and 0. 24 ng, respectively, for all materials. To determine the amount of NVOCs measured in the atmosphere within forests, sampling was performed for a total of 14 air volume sections collected from a coniferous region using disposable tubes from September to October 2012. The results of the comparative analysis of the detected NVOC substances in these air volumes show the highest efficiency in the 9 L section. The analyte detection accuracy is between 85. 8 and 110. 9; this accuracy is high despite the high boiling point, which confirms that the NVOC analysis using the HS–SPME method is effective...|$|R

40|$|In this work, novel {{mesoporous}} silica hollow spheres (MSHS) were chosen as an immobilization matrix, {{to construct a}} mediator-free third-generation HRP biosensor. UV-vis spectroscopy revealed that horseradish peroxidase (HRP) entrapped in MSHS could retain its native Structure. FTIR spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms indicated that HRP are intercalated into the mesopores. The direct electron transfer of HRP entrapped in MSHS was observed. A pair of stable and well-defined redox peaks of HRP with a formal potential of <b>about</b> - <b>0.</b> 150 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0. 1 M pH 7. 0 phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) were obtained.

40|$|A {{simply and}} high {{selectively}} electrochemical method {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous determination of hydroquinone and catechol at a glassy carbon electrode modified with the poly L-methionine/multiwall carbon nanotubes, which significantly increased the reversible electrochemical reaction. The electrochemical behavior of catechol and hydroquinone at the modified electrode was studied by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The presence of hydroxyl MWCNTs in the composite film enhances the surface coverage concentration of poly L- methionine/multiwall carbon nanotubes. The results suggest that pH= 6 is the optimum acidity condition for the selective and simultaneous determination of catechol and hydroquinone. Under the optimized condition, the response peak currents of the modified electrodes were linear over ranges of 8. 0 ´ 10 - 7 2. 0 ´ 10 - 4 mol/L (R 2 = <b>0.</b> <b>997)</b> for hydroquinone and 8. 0 ´ 10 - 7 2. 0 ´ 10 - 4, R 2 = <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> for catechol.

MethodsIn this observational study, 100 normal candidates underwent Scheimpflug analysis with Sirius 3 D Rotating Scheimpflug Camera and Topography System (Costruzione Strumenti Oftalmici, Italy). Two scans in {{dark room conditions}} were performed by the same experienced user. The candidates were asked to keep both eyes closed for 5 min before the scans. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery, corneal scarring and anterior segment/posterior segment anomalies. Only the right eyes {{were used for the}} analysis. Both corneal (central, minimum, and apical thickness, volume, horizontal visible iris diameter, and apical curvature) and anterior chamber (volume, depth, angle, horizontal diameter) measurements were evaluated. ResultsThere was no difference in the means of repeated measurements (p> 0. 05, ANOVA). Intraclass correlations between the measures were high and ranged from 0. 995 – <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> for corneal to 0. 964 – <b>0.</b> <b>997</b> for anterior chamber (AC) parameters.
