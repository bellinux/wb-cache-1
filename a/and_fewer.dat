These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some were isolated in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where Paramysis has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts.|$|E

5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation of violence and centralisation of authority into fewer <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|The lungs of most {{reptiles}} have {{a single}} bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In tuataras, snakes, and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The plumage colour is genetically controlled, {{and studies}} in Finland and Italy {{indicate}} that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, <b>and</b> <b>fewer</b> parasites than brown birds. Although this {{might suggest that}} eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, Gloger's rule would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.|$|E
