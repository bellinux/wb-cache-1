Design: focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews were undertaken with Western Australian women who had opted for public maternity care to determine the values schema apparent in their expectations of their care. Setting: public maternity-care services in metropolitan (i. e. Armadale, Osborne Park and Rockingham) and regional (i. e. Broome, Geraldton, Bunbury) Western Australia. Findings: women interviewed {{were found to have}} consistent values schema underpinning their maternity-care expectations and evaluations. Conclusions: the current study suggests that while women 2 ̆ 7 s choices and experiences of maternity care may differ on a range of dimensions, the values schema underlying their care expectations and subsequent evaluations are similar.

Despite findings in the United States and in other nations that there are small differences in mean achievement between males and females, {{research has found that}} males tend to be more variable than females in their spread of mathematics achievement. In other words, males as compared to females tend to dominate the upper percentiles of the achievement distribution, beginning the unequal representation of males as compared to females in the mathematics and scientific fields. This dissertation investigated gender differences in mathematics achievement using a social-psychological perspective that included components of theories on motivation and social influences. National-level differences in mean and dispersion of mathematics achievement were established using nationally representative data from thirty-eight countries that participated at the Population 2 level of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Variables representing the social-psychological framework, such as students 2 ̆ 7 interest in mathematics, students 2 ̆ 7 value of mathematics achievement, students 2 ̆ 7 use of time outside of school, and students 2 ̆ 7 parental expectation were constructed from 198, 699 thirteen-year-old students across thirty-one nations who responded to the TIMSS Student Background Questionnaire. After establishing the reliability and meaningfulness of these variables, relationships among gender, mathematics achievement, interest, value, time use, and mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>expectation</b> were explored for each country using a loglinear variance model. Significant gender differences in mean mathematics achievement remained in nineteen countries after controlling for differences in motivation, mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>expectation,</b> time use, and other family background variables. Significant gender differences in dispersion of mathematics achievement scores remained in nine countries after controlling for variations in motivation, mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>expectation,</b> time use, and other family background variables.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{empirical}} framework for detecting {{the existence and}} estimating {{the magnitude of the}} softness of a budget constraint. The defining feature of a soft budget constraint is a subordinate organization 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>expectations</b> of being bailed out by a superior organization in case of financial trouble. This implies that one has to link the organization 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>expectations</b> for being bailed out to its fiscal behavior in order to quantify the extent of the soft budget constraint. We postulate that expectations for bailouts are formed rationally and make use of an instrumental variable method to get consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. We argue that past own experience of being bailed out and bailouts of other subordinate organizations can be used to construct credible instruments for the formation of bailout expectations. We apply our empirical approach to a unique panel data set of 286 Swedish local governments where the central government provided a total of 1, 697 bailouts between 1974 and 1992. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a soft budget constraint; a local government increases its level of debt by 6 - 10 percent if it expects to be bailed out with probability one as compared to when the likelihood is zero due to previous experience of being bailed out, while the effect on debt from bailouts of its geographical neighbors is roughly four times as large...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} yield spreads on bonds issued by sub-sovereign {{entities}} within federations are driven by bailout expectations and investors 2 ̆ 019 risk appetite, as opposed to fundamental values related to default risk. The question is analysed both across and within federations using a novel dataset for sub-sovereign governments that includes Australian states, Canadian provinces, Swiss cantons, German L 4 nder, US states, Spanish communities, and Indian states. The paper finds that, regardless of the prevailing set-up of the federal system, sub-sovereign debt levels relative to GDP and global risk aversion are important drivers of sub-sovereign spreads. Moreover, within federations, the market 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>expectation</b> of a federal bailout of the sub-sovereign entity and {{the capacity of the}} federal government to provide support to the weaker members of the federation affect the extent to which fundamental factors are priced into spreads. In particular, the paper shows that the positive link between debt and risk premia tends to break down when sub-sovereign government debt rises above certain thresholds. This could reflect the market 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>expectation</b> of a federal bailout as fundamentals deteriorate. Additionally, larger sub-sovereign entities tend to pay higher premia as fundamentals worsen which could be linked to the limited capacity of the federal government to provide support as the size of the expected bailout increases. A pattern of rising risk premia as fundamentals worsen is also found for sub-sovereign entities when the central government faces borrowing constraints...|$|R
