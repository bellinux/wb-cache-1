5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a {{predominantly}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats in his canvasses for public office. His 1879 loss {{in an election}} for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky Senate marked the first in a string of political defeats. He failed in bids to represent Kentucky's Fifth District in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1884, 1886, 1888, and 1892. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1884, 1888, 1892, 1904, 1908, and 1916. In 1897, {{he was a member of}} the executive committee at the national monetary conference in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he advocated a sound money position.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a {{primarily}} Democratic state, Willson suffered several defeats {{for public}} office, but was elected governor of Kentucky {{on his second}} attempt. Due to {{his handling of the}} Black Patch Tobacco Wars and his pardoning of several individuals involved in the assassination of Democratic governor William Goebel, Willson drew the ire of the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. As a result, few of his proposed reforms were considered by the legislature. His term ended in 1911, and in 1914, he made an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Following this defeat, Willson retired to Louisville, where he died in 1931.|$|E
5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E

5|$|After being urged into {{politics}} by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled far behind Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{served as}} a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. He was awarded a Bronze Star, an Air Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal for his efforts on the battlefield. Upon his return home, Hunter pursued a career in law and was {{admitted}} to the bar in 1976. Four years later, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the Reagan Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{routinely}} {{votes for}} the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County. Pockets of Republican strength are in the central areas along the I-495 crescent, Hampden County, and communities on the south and north shores, but {{the state as a}} whole has not given its Electoral College votes to <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a presidential election since Ronald Reagan carried it in 1984. Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the 1980 and 1984 elections.|$|E
5|$|Only one Republican {{candidate}} for Mayor, Squirrel Hill resident Joshua Wander, filed a petition {{prior to the}} March 12 filing deadline to run as <b>a</b> <b>Republican.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Wander had stated an intention to run as a write-in {{candidate for}} the Democratic nomination. Wander had previously run as a write-in candidate for the Republican Mayoral nomination in the 2009 election, but was defeated by incumbent Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, also a write-in candidate in the Republican primary. The Republican primary took place alongside the Democratic primary on May 21, 2013. Wander, having run unopposed, won the nomination.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> {{a heavily}} Democratic state, Bradley found little success {{early in his}} {{political}} career. He was defeated for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate twice each. After rising to national prominence with his speech seconding the presidential nomination of Ulysses S. Grant at the 1880 Republican National Convention, he was nominated for governor in 1887. Although he lost the contest to Simon Bolivar Buckner, he reduced the usual Democratic majority substantially. He was again nominated for governor in 1895. Capitalizing on divisions in the Democratic Party over the issue of free silver, he defeated Parker Watkins Hardin in the general election. His term was marked by political struggles and violence. He was an advocate for blacks and did much to advance their status in the state, but was unable to enact much of his reform agenda because of a hostile Democratic majority in the state legislature.|$|E

5|$|Bradley's {{political}} career began in 1870, {{when he was}} elected prosecuting attorney of Garrard County. <b>A</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> the heavily Democratic Eighth District, Bradley was defeated by Milton J. Durham for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1872. In 1875, his party honored him with a nomination to serve in the U.S. Senate, even though he was too young to legally qualify for the office. Nevertheless, he received the vote of every Republican in the state legislature. The following year, he again lost to Durham for a seat in the House of Representatives, but received 3,000 more votes than any Republican candidate had ever received in that district. He refused his party's nomination for the Senate in 1878 and 1882, and declined a nomination for state attorney general in 1879 because of ill health.|$|E
5|$|In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, {{this time}} {{set in the}} upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's {{newspaper}} district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The World's Columbian Exposition was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery {{was used as a}} mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights of the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by Bertha Palmer, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.|$|E
5|$|Lilly's friends often {{urged him}} to seek public office, and they {{attempted}} to nominate him to run for Governor of Indiana as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> 1896, but he refused. Lilly shunned public office, preferring to focus his attention on his philanthropic organizations. He did regularly endorse candidates, and made substantial donations to politicians who advanced his causes. After former Indiana governor Oliver P. Morton and others suggested {{the creation of a}} memorial to Indiana's many Civil War veterans, Lilly began raising funds to build the Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. Construction began in 1888, but the monument was not completed until 1901, three years after Lilly's death. The interior of the monument houses a civil war museum, established in 1918, that is named in Lilly's honor.|$|E

5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out which side had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E
