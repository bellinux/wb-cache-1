He sent down 408 balls without reward {{in the three}} Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an over in his Test career.

His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in <b>all,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> best of 162, {{at an average of}} 28.06.
