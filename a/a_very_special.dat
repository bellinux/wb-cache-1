5|$|Perforator veins play <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>special</b> {{role in the}} venous system, {{carrying}} {{blood from}} superficial to deep veins. During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins. When their valves become insufficient, {{they are responsible for}} a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers. Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured. However, the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery, for example a minimally invasive CHIVA. The ultrasonography report will include insufficient and continent perforators, which will also be shown on venous mapping. To test these veins properly, the examiner will need to use some techniques like the Paraná maneuver, toe and foot flexion, and hyper-extension on tip toes.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, McCarthy {{was back}} as joint-coach of the Cork senior hurling {{team with the}} Rev. Michael O'Brien. It {{was the second time}} that he was coach of his native county. That year McCarthy helped guide Cork to their third Munster title in succession. The provincial final win over Tipperary was truly {{remarkable}} given the fact that Cork were trailing by four points with four minutes to go and ended up winning the game by four points. This victory allowed Cork to advance directly to the centenary year All-Ireland final. Offaly provided the opposition on that occasion in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>special</b> championship decider at Semple Stadium in Thurles. It was their first meeting {{in the history of the}} championship, however, Cork were the favourites. A 3–16 to 1–12 victory gave McCarthy's Cork a reasonably easy but <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>special</b> victory nonetheless.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>special</b> instrument.

But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E

25|$|Local {{coordinates}} mean {{a set of}} coordinates {{that travel}} with the particle, and have orientation determined by {{the path of the}} particle.

His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display for all to see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E
