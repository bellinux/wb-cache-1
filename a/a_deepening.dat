5|$|<b>A</b> <b>deepening</b> trough {{over the}} eastern United States was {{forecast}} {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced {{from the center of}} circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can be {{attributed}} to <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low off the coast of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was located {{to the south}} of the subtropical ridge, resulting in a west-northwest track which brought the center over Guadeloupe. The circulation was initially broad, and dry air temporarily entrained the northwest quadrant of the storm. However, environmental conditions were favorable enough for further development, with <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> trough to its west providing beneficial flow. Banding features improved around the circulation, and the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Jeanne on September 13 about 135mi (220km) southeast of Saint Croix. While crossing the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought locally heavy rainfall, with a total of 12inches (305mm) reported in Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, especially to the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E
5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward {{along the edge of}} a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system and found that it had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring. The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving {{quickly to the}} east-northeast, due to <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> mid-level low south of the Canadian Maritimes. It maintained good upper-level outflow, and its track over the gulf stream allowed for steady strengthening. Early on July 15, convection increased over the center and developed an organized rainband southwest of the center; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Arthur. After continuing to steadily intensify, Arthur attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 16 about 490miles (790km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Upon reaching peak intensity, the convection had become well-organized over the center despite westerly wind shear. Subsequently, the center became separated from the area of deepest convection, and Arthur maintained its peak intensity as it began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The storm turned northward around the larger mid-level low, and by July 17 Arthur completed extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter, the extratropical remnants crossed eastern Newfoundland. On July 19, the remnants of Arthur turned to a southeast drift between Newfoundland and Greenland, and by {{late in the day}} its winds decreased to below gale force.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{off with}} {{pioneering}} work by Ernest Mandel from 1964, various {{attempts have been}} made to link the long waves of capitalist development to long-term fluctuations in average profitability. Mandel's influential Phd thesis Late Capitalism (in German 1972, English version 1975) was a critical response to Henryk Grossman's theory. Like Henryk Grossman, Mandel was convinced of the centrality of profitability in the trajectory of capitalist development, but Mandel did not believe that Marx's reproduction models could be used to create a theory of capitalist crises. In Grossman's profitability model, there was only a series of business cycles and, sometime after the 34th cycle, a general breakdown of capitalism, because insufficient surplus value was being generated. Leaving aside the issue of the validity of Grossman's model, his picture of capitalist development did not explain historical phases of faster and slower economic growth lasting about 25 years or so. After World War 2, a long boom occurred, instead of <b>a</b> <b>deepening</b> capitalist crisis which many Marxists had expected. That was what Mandel wanted to explain (Mandel's and Grossman's growth models both ignore the accumulation of non-productive capital assets and profits not arising from new surplus-value).|$|E
