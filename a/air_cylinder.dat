5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, {{but quickly}} {{discovered}} {{that they were not}} as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an emergency <b>air</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{are made}} of aluminium, steel, or of a {{composite}} construction (usually carbon-fiber wrapped.) The composite cylinders are the lightest in weight and are therefore preferred by fire departments (UK: fire and rescue services previously called fire brigades), {{but they also have}} the shortest lifespan and must be taken out of service after 15 years. <b>Air</b> <b>cylinders</b> must be hydrostatically tested every 5 years. During extended operations, empty <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> can be quickly replaced with fresh ones and then refilled from larger tanks in a cascade storage system or from an air compressor brought to the scene.|$|R

25|$|The diver {{and tender}} {{on the surface}} are {{connected}} by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even {{if he or she}} must remove the <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> or buoyancy control device. The harness fits over the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically {{the changes}} to the car had {{focussed}} on improving the traction, rather than increasing the already generous power. Double wheels and tyres were fitted to the rear axle, to improve grip. The final drive was also split into separate drives to each side. This reduced the load on each drive, allowed the driver position to be lowered, but required the wheelbase to be shortened asymmetrically on one side by 1½"(37mm). Airbrakes were fitted, actuated by a large <b>air</b> <b>cylinder.</b> For extra streamlining the radiator air intake could be closed by a movable flap, {{for a brief period}} during the record itself.|$|E
25|$|While the {{hydraulic}} suction anchors cut the bow free, the salvage crews raised several smaller pieces of wreckage. This included {{a piece of}} a torpedo tube weighing about a ton which was analysed to try to learn if the explosion occurred inside or outside the tube. They salvaged a high-pressure compressed <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> weighing about half a ton, {{to learn more about the}} nature of the explosion. They also brought up a part of the cylindrical section of the hard frame and part of the left forward spherical partition, to determine the intensity and temperature of the fire in the forward compartment. Finally, they raised a fragment of the sonar system dome.|$|E

25|$|Early scuba divers dived {{without a}} {{buoyancy}} aid. In an emergency {{they had to}} jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, {{which can be used}} to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled <b>air</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.|$|E
25|$|In {{conjunction}} with London Transport from 1937 Leyland developed the Tiger FEC, the initials stood for flat-engined coach. The Leyland 8.6-litre engine (with revised sump) was mounted horizontally in mid wheel-base driving through a Wilson fluid-flywheel and an air-actuated AEC mechanical pre-selector gearbox. The gearbox was {{basically the same}} as used in the STL but it was fitted with an externally mounted <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> which actuated the bus bar to engage and disengage the gears. It worked in the opposite way from that in the slightly later RT type double decker in that air pressure was used to disengage the gears instead of being used to keep them engaged. When the gear change pedal was released it allowed the selected gear to engage by means of spring pressure in that {{same way as the}} gearbox in the STL. The system caused problems in that if a vehicle was left with a gear engaged and the air pressure leaked off {{it was not possible to}} disengage that gear until air pressure had been built up again. Because of this, there were a number of garage incidents caused by vehicles being left overnight with a gear still engaged. 88 of this type were built and 12 were destroyed during World War Two, the rest serving until 1954-5 as Green Line coaches.|$|E

Three <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> and a compressor selection design for shedding; weft insertion and beat-up operations were based on Pascal’s law with load factors including losses considered.

There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit.|$|E

It was put on before putting on the cylinder harness.

40|$|Abstract: By using {{numerical}} simulation method,the {{three-dimensional flow field}} of <b>air</b> supply <b>cylinder</b> using for displacement ventilation in industrial plant is analyzed. The internal structure, effective wind sent area and the shape of wind outlet small hole which affected the air outlet wind speed of <b>air</b> supply <b>cylinder</b> are researched. While compared with the simulated and measured result of the outlet velocity of the wind outlet small hole, the best feature parameters of wind speed in <b>air</b> supply <b>cylinder</b> has been gained. The result shows that: by changing the internal structure and decreasing the effective air supply area of the <b>air</b> supply <b>cylinder,</b> the wind speed from the air-outlet on the small hole can be more reasonably distributed; although by increasing the effective air supply area and changing the shape of outlet hole on <b>air</b> supply <b>cylinder</b> will make the air outlet be more effectively distributed, its value is unreasonable. Foreword In the 1970 s, as an emerging technology, the displacement ventilation was used in industrial workshop in order to solve the ventilation problem in the industrial plants. In recent years, displacement ventilation has been vigorously promoted in the industrial and civil buildings due to its good ventilation performance.

50|$|In I Corps (the northernmost {{military}} district in Vietnam) boats based at Da Nang, Tan My and Cửa Việt had three man crews of various rates and ranks.

One of the two crewmen was almost always an Engineman, and could be an ENFA, ENFN, or an EN3 in rank. The LCM-8s there all had two sets of the twin 6-71 Detroits paired up to a hydro transmission.

50|$|Thermoforming {{has benefited}} from {{applications}} of engineering technology3, although the basic forming process {{is very similar to}} what was invented many years ago. Microprocessor and computer controls on more modern machinery allow for greatly increased process control and repeatability of same-job setups from one production run with the ability to save oven heater and process timing settings between jobs. The ability to place formed sheet into an inline trim station for more precise trim registration has been hugely improved due to the common use of electric servo motors for chain indexing versus <b>air</b> <b>cylinders,</b> gear racks, and clutches on older machines. Electric servo motors are also used on some modern and more sophisticated forming machines for actuation of the machine platens where form and trim tooling are mounted, rather than <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> which have traditionally been the industry standard, giving more precise control over closing and opening speeds and timing of the tooling. Quartz and radiant-panel oven heaters generally provide more precise and thorough sheet heating over older cal-rod type heaters, and better allow for zoning of ovens into areas of adjustable heat..|$|R
