5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are fairly}} large and rounded. The {{origin of the}} first dorsal fin lies over {{the last third of}} the pelvic fin bases, while the origin of the much larger second dorsal fin lies over the rear of the anal fin. The claspers of adult males are moderately long and tapering, though those of some individuals may be knob-shaped and spiky. The anal fin is roughly equal in size to the pelvic fins, and smaller but longer-based than the second dorsal fin. The short caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The skin is thick; the dermal denticles have three-pointed crowns and are widely spaced compared to other species in the genus. Coloured yellowish brown above and cream below, this shark has a characteristic series of ten dorsal saddles from the head to the tail; each saddle is dark brown with a darker edge and a lighter middle. Unlike in the similar lined catshark, there are no spots or <b>additional</b> <b>markings</b> between the saddles.|$|E

25|$|In 1905 Widor and Schweitzer {{were among}} the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society, a choir {{dedicated}} to performing J.S. Bach's music, for whose concerts Schweitzer took the organ part regularly until 1913. He was also appointed organist for the Bach Concerts of the Orféo Català at Barcelona and often travelled there for that purpose. He and Widor collaborated on a new edition of Bach's organ works, with detailed analysis of each work in three languages (English, French, German). Schweitzer, who insisted that the score should show Bach's notation with no <b>additional</b> <b>markings,</b> wrote the commentaries for the Preludes and Fugues, and Widor those for the Sonatas and Concertos: six volumes were published in 1912–14. Three more, to contain the Chorale Preludes with Schweitzer's analyses, were {{to be worked on}} in Africa: but these were never completed, perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought.|$|E

These are relevant at a penalty corner; the former is the mark from which the attacking team takes the penalty corner and the latter is the closest position which a defender may stand. These marks had been [...] in earlier versions of the rules. There is a similar mark 5m from along the side line (from where long corners were formally taken) and a mark 14.6m along the side line indicating {{the level of the}} top of the penalty circle. There are also 150mm long markings where the goal posts are situated.|$|E

2500|$|Of the 38 crew, {{there were}} three fatalities. The captain had {{suffered}} a heart attack and two crew members were reported lost when they jumped overboard after the torpedo hit. She was the first American ship to be torpedoed during World War I, although another ship, the Cushing, had been bombed shortly before, again by mistake because no American markings could be seen from what was then a somewhat novel air attack. The German government apologized for attacking Gulflight, but refused to change its strategy of unrestricted submarine warfare. A report by the British admiralty into the attack concluded that the German commander had behaved properly according to [...] "Cruiser rules" [...] defined in international law. A merchant ship under escort by military vessels forfeited any right to be warned before being attacked, so the patrol ships had made Gulflight a legitimate target by taking her under escort. As an American ship, the submarine would not have attacked had he seen her nationality, but apart from an ordinary flag Gulflight was not carrying any <b>additional</b> <b>markings</b> painted on the hull to make clear her nationality, which other ships were then doing. The report also suggested that the tanker being stopped and then slowed down by the accompanying patrol had made her an accessible target. The Admiralty report was not published at the time and official comment did not explain the circumstances.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the Baroque repertoire available to nineteenth-century pianists by looking at piano tutors as well as published music editions and concludes {{that only a small}} proportion of music by Bach, Hadel and Scarlatti was available, along {{with a small amount of}} music by some other (predominantly) German and Italian composers. Only a handful of pieces by Francois Couperin and Rameau were available before the 1840 s. Some editors of this repertoire took a surprisingly modern approach by including very few <b>additional</b> performance <b>markings</b> (Clementi), or by distinguishing between their own text and the composer's (Kollmann), but later nineteenth century editors, led by figures such as Czerny, were more interventionist in their approach...|$|R
40|$|Disasters {{can cause}} {{extraordinary}} service demand by the public, while concurrently causing outages that reduce network capacity {{to serve the}} surging demand. It is imperative that services supporting disaster response management perform with minimal degradation during such events. Mechanisms exist within Internet Protocol (IP) -based networks to provide preferential treatment for services such as voice and video using Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP) in the packet headers and Per Hop Behaviors in the routers. However, there is currently no way to identify voice and video packets supporting response management and to ensure their timely delivery during network overload periods. We have applied simulation to evaluate the benefit of <b>additional</b> DSCP <b>markings</b> {{to be applied to}} such voice and video packets, and several router configurations. The results demonstrate significant value of the additions in preserving disaster response management performance even when aberration in demand causes ordinary voice and video performance to degrade. ...|$|R

Females with incomplete markings or all-black abdomens occasionally occur. The cephalothorax is {{much smaller than the}} abdomen, and is black. Redback spiderlings are grey with dark spots, and become darker with each moult. Juvenile females have <b>additional</b> white <b>markings</b> on the abdomen. The bright scarlet red colours may serve as a warning to potential predators. Each spider has a pair of venom glands each attached to each of its chelicerae with very small fangs.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of a white}} brow band in siamang is documented for the first time. The characteristic occurs in 4. 4 % of 250 siamang. Among adult sia-mang the characteristic occurs more often in females than in males (11. 3 % of 71 females vs. 1. 4 % of 73 males). In a particular family lineage of captive siamang (not included in the numbers above), the characteristic was unusu-ally frequent (42. 9 % of 14).

In contrast to other studies, our results suggest that the presence of white facial markings, and possibly also of white hands and feet and of a bright corona are prim-itive gibbon traits. In addition, some degree of sexual dichromatism in the circumfacial markings appears to have occurred in the common ancestor of all gibbons.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the clinical features, and diagnostic {{findings of a}} chronic respiratory condition in 29 West Highland white terriers. Typically, the dogs were coughing chronically, had dyspnoea and tachypnoea of varying severity, and had deteriorated progressively over months to year. The mean (sem) survival time in months from the clinical signs being first noted by the owners was 17. 9 (2. 3). Most cases had a combination of respiratory signs, but coughing was the predominant sign in 18 cases. Inspiratory crackles were audible on chest auscultation in 28 cases, 10 of which were also wheezing. Rhonchi were the predominant sound in the remaining case. The main radiographic changes were mild to severe increased interstitial markings in all cases, with <b>additional</b> bronchial <b>markings</b> in 14 of the dogs. Right-sided cardiomegaly (cor pulmonale) was recorded in 15. Bronchoscopic findings in 17 of the dogs were either normal or involved a mild airway mucoid reaction in eight. Chronic mucosal changes were observed in eight, but in two this finding was equivocal. Dynamic changes to the lumen of the airway were present in seven cases. No significant haematological or biochemical changes could be detected in 20 cases, but four cases were hypercholestrolaemic. A histopathological assessment of four cases revealed alveolar septal fibrosis to be the predominant change. Prednisolone, with or without bronchodilators, was {{the most commonly used}} therapy, and the response was variable. The condition appears to be associated with significant pulmonary interstitial fibrosis of unknown aetiology and has clinical similarities to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) in human beings...|$|R
