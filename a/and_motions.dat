Stereo <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> image analysis are intimately connected and can provide complementary information to obtain robust estimates of scene structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> We present an information fusion based approach for multi-camera and multi-body structure <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> that combines bottom-up and top-down knowledge on scene structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> The only assumption we make is that all scene motion consists of rigid motion. We present experimental results on synthetic and nonsynthetic data sets, demonstrating excellent performance compared to binocular based state-of-the-art approaches for structure <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches <b>and</b> <b>motions</b> before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo <b>and</b> <b>motions,</b> rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E

50|$|Newton {{asserted}} that time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> {{can be distinguished}} into absolute/relative, true/apparent, mathematical/vulgar.

He described an absolute time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion</b> that are distinguished from relative or apparent time, space, <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b> Berkeley disagreed. To him, all motion is relative because the idea that Berkeley had of motion necessarily included relation. By pure space, I mean that I conceive that I can move {{my arms and legs}} without anything resisting them. Space is less pure when there is more resistance by other bodies. Space, therefore, is an idea that is relative to body <b>and</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|R
