40|$|Like most {{indigenous}} populations {{throughout the}} world who have undergone innumerable cultural changes, the mental health care needs of <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> are great. Some surveys conducted by the Indian Health Service show high rates of suicide, mortality, depression and substance abuse.

5|$|Churchill {{has been}} active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement of Colorado, now an {{autonomous}} chapter of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T.

The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T.

25|$|When <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> {{first arrived}} {{in what is now}} Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape.

This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago), <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.|$|R

50|$|Like United States v. Nice, the United States Supreme Court case of United States v. Sandoval (1913) {{rose from}} efforts to bar <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> {{from the sale}} of liquor. As <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> were granted citizenship, there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was {{distinct}} from regular citizens. The Sandoval Act reversed the U.S. v. Joseph decision of 1876, which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians. The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were “not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution.” This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to <b>American</b> <b>Indians.</b> The ruling continued to suggest that <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> needed protection.|$|R
