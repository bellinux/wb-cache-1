5|$|Philip and {{his army}} joined {{his son in}} 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after {{stubborn}} resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favour, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on {{the request of the}} Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes, who both rejected it.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A feeble attempt at a common peace {{had been made in}} 375 BC, but desultory fighting between <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta had resumed by 373BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.|$|E
5|$|After having reconquered Ionia, the Persians {{began to}} plan their next moves of {{extinguishing}} {{the threat to}} their empire from Greece; and punishing <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria. The resultant first Persian invasion of Greece consisted of two main campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's {{early life}} alternated between the Royal Palace in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> Tatoi Palace in the city's suburbs. With his parents he {{undertook}} several trips abroad and regularly visited Schloss Friedrichshof, {{the home of}} his maternal grandmother, who had a particular affection for her Greek grandson.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, {{the only}} {{unfinished}} business that remained {{by the end}} of 493 BC was to exact punishment on <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E

5|$|Hetairai {{could be}} the most independent, wealthy, and {{influential}} women in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> could form long-term relationships with rich and powerful men. The most successful hetairai were free to choose their clients, and sometimes became concubines of their former clients.|$|E
5|$|PerdiccasII {{sided with}} Sparta in the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC) between <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta, and in 429 BC Athens retaliated by persuading Sitalces to invade Macedonia, {{but he was}} forced to retreat owing to a {{shortage}} of provisions in winter. In 424 BC, Arrhabaeus, a local ruler of Lynkestis in Upper Macedonia, rebelled against his overlord Perdiccas, and the Spartans agreed to help in putting down the revolt. At the Battle of Lyncestis the Macedonians panicked and fled before the fighting began, enraging the Spartan general Brasidas, whose soldiers looted the unattended Macedonian baggage train. Perdiccas then changed sides and supported <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> he was able to put down Arrhabaeus's revolt.|$|E
5|$|The Cretan War (205–200 BC) {{was fought}} by King Philip V of Macedon, the Aetolian League, many Cretan cities (of which Olous and Hierapytna {{were the most}} important) and Spartan pirates {{against the forces of}} Rhodes and later Attalus I of Pergamum, Byzantium, Cyzicus, <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> Knossos.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{states of}} <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria allowed {{themselves}} {{to be drawn into}} this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis. After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria.|$|E
5|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{for such a}} transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including Pythagoras traveling as far as India; Indian philosophers visiting <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> meeting Socrates; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse; or, intermediated through Persia.|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> {{within sight of the}} city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|At present, the {{majority}} of the frieze is at the British Museum in London (forming the major part of the Elgin Marbles); the largest proportion of the rest is in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> the remainder of fragments shared between six other institutions. Casts of the frieze may be found in the Beazley archive at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, at the Spurlock Museum in Urbana, in the Skulpturhalle at Basel and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Despite these events, Pisander and {{the other}} envoys of the conspirators arrived at <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his {{promises}} at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.|$|E
5|$|In 499 BC, {{the tyrant}} of Miletus, Aristagoras, {{embarked}} on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos, with Persian support; however, the expedition was a debacle and, pre-empting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians. This {{was the beginning of}} the Ionian Revolt, which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria, and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis. The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade, the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year.|$|E
5|$|In Justinian's reign, {{and partly}} under his patronage, Byzantine culture {{produced}} noteworthy historians, including Procopius and Agathias, and poets such as Paul the Silentiary and Romanus the Melodist flourished. On the other hand, centres of learning as the Platonic Academy in <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> the famous Law School of Beirut lost their importance during his reign. Despite Justinian's {{passion for the}} glorious Roman past, the practice of choosing Roman consul was allowed to lapse after 541.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} his accession in 359 BC, the Macedonian king, Philip II, had rapidly strengthened and expanded his kingdom into Thrace and Chalkidiki {{on the northern}} coast of the Aegean Sea. He was aided in this process by the distraction of <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes, the two most powerful city-states in Greece at that point, by events elsewhere. In particular, these events included the Social War between <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> her erstwhile allies (357–355 BC), and the Third Sacred War which erupted in central Greece in 356 BC between the Phocians {{and the other members}} of the Delphic Amphictyonic League. Much of Philip's expansion during this period was at the nominal expense of the Athenians, who considered the north Aegean coast as their sphere of influence, and Philip was at war with Athens from 356–346 BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of these events, both the Spartans and their opponents {{prepared}} for more serious fighting to come. In late 395 BC, Corinth and Argos entered the war as co-belligerents with <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes. A council was formed at Corinth to manage the affairs of this alliance. The allies then sent emissaries {{to a number of}} smaller states and received the support of many of them.|$|E
5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first peace between <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean. Kagan believes that Pericles used Callias, a brother-in-law of Cimon, {{as a symbol of}} unity and employed him several times to negotiate important agreements.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, 1939, White married Mary Ann Williamson near Malvern in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Williamson was {{a native}} of Berkeley County, West Virginia, but resided in Athens, West Virginia, {{at the time of her}} marriage. Williamson was a {{graduate}} of Shepherd College in Shepherdstown, of Concord College in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> of the University of Kentucky in Lexington. She had been a member of the faculty at Marshall College in Huntington since 1934.|$|E
5|$|Other {{artefacts}} in {{the cathedral}} include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events {{in the cathedral}}'s history. The ornate pulpit (1710), the largest in Sweden, was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht. It {{was a gift from}} Queen Hedvig Eleonora after the fire of 1702. Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert, Saint Paul in <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria. An army was assembled in Susa, and marched into Cilicia, where a fleet had been gathered. Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Chaeronea {{was fought}} in 338 BC, {{near the city}} of Chaeronea in Boeotia, between the Macedonians led by Philip II of Macedon and an {{alliance}} of some of the Greek city-states led by <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes. The battle was the culmination of Philip's campaign in Greece (339–338 BC) and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Halmyros, {{known by}} older {{scholars}} as the Battle of the Cephissus or Battle of Orchomenos, was fought on 15 March 1311 between {{the forces of}} the Frankish Duchy of <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> its vassals under Walter of Brienne and the mercenaries of the Catalan Company, resulting in a devastating victory for the Catalans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Eurymedon was {{a double}} battle, taking place both on water and land, between the Delian League of <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> her Allies, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. It {{took place in}} either 469 or 466 BC, in the {{vicinity}} of the mouth of the Eurymedon River (now the Köprüçay) in Pamphylia, Asia Minor. It forms part of the Wars of the Delian League, itself part of the larger Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt {{constituted}} {{the first major}} conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents {{the first phase of}} the Greco-Persian Wars. Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, but Darius had vowed to punish <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria for their support for the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire, he decided to embark on the conquest of all Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Oracle of Athens– An oracle {{that lived}} in Athens. Shocked at Athena's {{decision}} for choosing Kratos, the Oracle directed him to find Pandora's Box. Kratos later returned to <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> found her mortally wounded due to Ares' war on the city. The character was voiced by Susan Blakeslee in God of War.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Philocrates {{eventually}} {{broke down}} as hostilities reignited between <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered {{a series of}} speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, a task that instead fell to his son and successor, Alexander the Great.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{having given}} clear warning of his plans, Darius sent ambassadors {{to all the}} cities of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta, both of whom instead executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now also effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.|$|E
5|$|The relay began 24 March 2008, in Olympia, Greece. From there, it {{traveled}} across Greece to Panathinaiko Stadium in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> then to Beijing, {{arriving on}} 31 March. From Beijing, the torch followed a route passing through every continent except Antarctica. The torch visited cities on the Silk Road, symbolizing ancient links between China {{and the rest}} of the world. A total of 21,880 torchbearers were selected from around the world by various organizations and entities.|$|E
5|$|When Aristagoras {{organized}} the Ionian Revolt, Eretria and Athens supported him by sending ships and troops to Ionia and by burning Sardis. Persian military and naval operations {{to quell the}} revolt ended in the Persian reoccupation of Ionian and Greek islands, {{as well as the}} re-subjugation of Thrace and the conquering of Macedonia in 492 BC under Mardonius. Macedon had been a vassal kingdom of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained autonomy. Mardonius' 492 campaign made it a fully subordinate part of the Persian kingdom. These military actions, coming as a direct response to the revolt in Ionia, were the beginning of the First Persian invasion of (mainland) Greece. At the same time, anti-Persian parties gained more power in <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> pro-Persian aristocrats were exiled from <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta. Darius responded by sending troops led by his son-in-law across the Hellespont. However, a violent storm and harassment by the Thracians forced the troops to return to Persia. Seeking revenge on <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Eretria, Darius assembled another army of 20,000 men under his Admiral, Datis, and his nephew Artaphernes, who met success when they captured Eretria and advanced to Marathon. In 490 BCE, at the Battle of Marathon, the Persian army was defeated by a heavily armed Athenian army, with 9,000 men who were supported by 600 Plataeans and 10,000 lightly armed soldiers led by Miltiades.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to Euboea {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both <b>Athens</b> <b>and</b> Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of <b>Athens,</b> <b>and</b> his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
