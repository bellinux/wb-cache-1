25|$|I Was Looking at the Ceiling <b>and</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> the Sky (1995): A stage {{piece with}} {{libretto}} by June Jordan and staging by Peter Sellars. The main characters are seven young Americans from different social and ethnic backgrounds, all living in Los Angeles. The story {{takes place in}} the aftermath of the earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Watkins {{remembers the}} first time they saw the group: [...] "I saw Mark Fox. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> these little girls {{skipping}} and running around. And they looked about thirteen. This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It was my fault entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
60|$|He moved a {{few steps}} towards them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> paused. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that my father was}} leaning forward, and in his shaking hand was a tiny gleaming revolver. A certain desperate courage seemed to have come to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{some of the}} old {{soldiers}} laughing, I {{began to}} understand that this man was trying to frighten us; so I began to laugh also, and the others as well, {{but it was not a}} very hearty laugh either.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood on}} the jetty {{for a minute or}} two, {{trembling}} all over with cold <b>and</b> temper. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> he 'ad got a light in 'is cabin, and I crept aboard and peeped down the skylight. And I just 'ad time to see some sovereigns on the table, when he looked up and blew out the light.|$|R
500|$|Henning Solberg, meanwhile, {{went off}} the road and into a ditch as he entered one of the corners on the stage, and his brother Petter had a similar problem in the same corner, but his quick {{reactions}} were able to control the car so he just drove into the scrub and got back on track. Henning finished in seventeenth place, and Petter finished joint-fifth with Cuoq on [...] Loeb ran his slowest time on this stage after he reduced speed and his tyres went cold. [...] "I was a bit faster than Dani [...] on the start of the stage, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my splits [...] and then I tried to slow down," [...] he explained. [...] "We had hard tyres and when you slow down the tyres [...] and then you lose the grip more and more, and at the end it was really tricky and I had cold tyres, so I just tried to slow down. The end [...] was really tricky so I didn't want to take any risks." [...] was won by Hirvonen with a time of [...] Loeb was 1.2s slower and finished second. Atkinson lost all the time he made up in [...] by finishing in eighth place, [...] slower than Hirvonen. This reduced the gap between the two in the overall classifications to just [...] Sordo, meanwhile, had his worst stage and finished in [...]|$|E
2500|$|... (1995) I Was Looking at the Ceiling <b>and</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> the Sky (song play) ...|$|E
2500|$|All I {{can tell}} you is that it {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I was a white hippie boy <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Love {{makes us}} hypocrites, I fear, my Ferdinand; for, a moment before, I was so wearied that I {{was lying on}} my sofa quite wretched. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him, <b>I</b> pretended that I had not been out, and was just {{thinking}} of a stroll. Oh, my Ferdinand! will you pardon me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't," [...] he said gently. [...] "It {{was perhaps}} worth very little; {{but it was}} all I had, and--since that day by the river--I never asked for {{anything}} in return. It was very hard not to now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that you had only kindness to spare for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{all at once}} {{a strange}} thing happened. The scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes. He looked astonished, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> foolish. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the color {{creeping}} up into his cheeks. As for me, I still stood there staring at him, not able to say a single word.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{performed}} in the 2007 WOMAD (World of Music, Arts and Dance) festival concert, and in reviewing his performance BBC Radio referred to his voice as [...] "sensational". D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. I closed my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before. I don't know why this world...is choosing...always...war and hate, because things are much easier to solve if you just want to solve them, that's what I feel. And maybe it's naïve, but this is my belief." ...|$|E
60|$|Softly I {{moved across}} the room towards him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that he was asleep.|$|E
60|$|Patt started--seemed surprised; {{her cheeks}} flushed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that {{pleasure}} was the feeling predominant.|$|E
6000|$|Silent, {{only for}} a moment. As the sails rose to the wind, and the ship began to move, there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers, which those on board took up, and echoed back, and which were echoed and re-echoed. My heart burst out when I heard the sound, and beheld the waving of the hats <b>and</b> handkerchiefs--and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her! ...|$|R
60|$|To {{these things}} {{they gave him}} no answer; only they looked upon each other, <b>and</b> laughed. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that they went on all, save that Christian kept before, who had no more talk but with himself, and {{sometimes}} sighingly, and sometimes comfortably; also he would be often reading in the roll {{that one of the}} Shining Ones gave him, by which he was refreshed.|$|R
60|$|I {{squeezed}} myself {{against the}} wall and looked down upon the never-ending procession. The street was continually blocked with motor cars and taxicabs. On {{the other side of the}} way streams of people were moving all the time. I recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> suddenly <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the gray motor car. I held out my hand to Mr. Bundercombe.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a {{helpless}} {{young man in}} their midst, who was being beaten and no doubt robbed.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, with a {{crashing}} in the bushes, the cub was {{hauled away}} from me, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Hiram at the rope.|$|E
60|$|He {{smiled in}} his {{superior}} way; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{come out in}} his face the singular, eager, consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried treasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Felix trembled violently {{as he said}} this. He and his {{companion}} entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> departed. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> any {{of the family of}} De Lacey more.|$|R
60|$|He {{was silent}} {{again for a}} while, uncertain, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> without comprehending, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the man's eyes grow smaller and a smile play about his mouth. He looked at the Vicomtesse with a new admiration to which she paid no heed.|$|R
6000|$|... "That you've been fooling me!" [...] {{the girl}} interrupted, {{a faint smile}} {{at the corners of}} her lips. [...] "Do you know, {{sometimes}} I suspected that you weren't in earnest! <b>And</b> <b>then</b> one day <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> your wife--and <b>I</b> wasn't sure!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you just}} found that out?" [...] he sneered; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that he had}} gone {{over to the door}} of the office only to close it.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> she {{was going}} to start something, and I bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea. But she had begun before I could get it.|$|E
60|$|Lindy set {{her lips}} with a mighty resolve to be silent. I heard some one coming along the gallery, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Nick's tall figure looming up behind her.|$|E
6000|$|... "The patent {{bush has}} got {{loose in the}} hub," [...] he resumed. [...] "I took the pin out <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> might have trouble if the wheel came off. It has been {{threatening}} to play this trick for some time." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} to drink a long draught, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> there was no exit, I could not but make myself more fit to be seen, for my hair had been pulled down and hung on my shoulders, and my face--ah! it had never looked {{anything}} like that, save on the one day when Eustace and I had the great battle, and our grand-mother punished us both by bread and water for a week.|$|R
60|$|The repulsive creature, {{squatting}} {{there in}} terror, attempted to escape me and leap {{into a trap}} behind her. But this time I {{was not to be}} outwitted by any such petty subterfuge. Before she had half arisen I had grasped her by the arm, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the guard starting to make a concerted rush upon me from all sides, I whipped out my dagger and, holding it close to that vile breast, ordered them to halt.|$|R
6000|$|... 15. I {{looked on}} them nine several days, <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that they were}} bad; A friend, too, spoke in their dispraise,-- [...] 530 He never read them;--with amaze I found Sir William Drummond had.|$|E
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that the}} giant was blind, And the dwarf a shrewd-eyed little thing; The giant, mild, timid, obeyed the string As {{if he had}} no {{independent}} mind, [...] Or will of any kind.|$|E
60|$|It was {{twilight}} when {{we turned}} to go, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that many of the}} warehouses along the wharves were heaps of ruins. My father said this was that the town might be the better defended.|$|E
6000|$|One {{morning at}} dawn, {{as we came}} into a village, we saw nearly the whole {{population}} mounting the marble steps of the temple, all the holiday dress of the Voluntaries, which they put on here every afternoon when the work is done. Last of the throng came a procession of children, looking something like a May-Day party, and midway of their line were {{a young man and}} a young girl, hand in hand, who parted {{at the door of the}} temple, and entered separately. Aristides called out, [...] "Oh, it is a wedding! You are in luck, Eveleth," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my first Altrurian wedding.|$|R
50|$|When I was {{a little}} kid, and I was reading these comics in the '40s, I kind of got sick of them because after a while, they were just formulaic. I figured {{there was some kind}} of a flaw that keeps them from getting better than they are, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Robert Crumb's work in the early '60s, when he moved from Philadelphia to Cleveland, and he moved around the corner from me, I thought 'Man, comics are where it's at'.|$|R
60|$|This was superstition. I did {{not feel}} thus franticly when first I knew that the holy name of father was become a curse to me: but my lonely life {{inspired}} me with wild thoughts; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Woodville & day after day he tried to win my confidence and I never dared give words to my dark tale, I was impressed more strongly with the withering fear that I was in truth a marked creature, a pariah, only fit for death.|$|R
