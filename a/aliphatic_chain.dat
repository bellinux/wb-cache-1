40|$|Abstract: The factor analysis, used in {{this work}} for the {{interpretation}} of maturation parameters observed in an exploration study {{of a group of}} surface sediments of diverse age originating from different localities in Serbia, resulted in two significant factors. Factor 1 involved parameters related mainly to maturation changes within the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>chains</b> of the organic matter and factor 2 involved parameters based mainly on changes in the terpane and sterane rings. A statistically significant inversely proportional linear dependence between factors 1 and 2 was observed with older, in contrast to younger sediments, suggesting that the reactions of the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>chains</b> in the older sediments did not occur simultaneously with the reactions in the rings and, also, that the older surface sediments examined in this study may be characterized by a degree of thermal maturity corresponding to changes in the biomarker sterane and terpane rings, while the younger sediments by intensive changes in the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R

The attachment of a hydrophobic <b>aliphatic</b> <b>chain</b> as those present in farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups allows small G-proteins to tether from membranes and carry out effector functions.|$|E
