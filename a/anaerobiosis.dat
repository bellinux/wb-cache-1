50|$|Arc A is {{regulated}} by FNR in anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic activation of arcA transcription is increased three- to fourfold {{in the presence}} of Fnr. The arcA upstream regulatory region contains five putative promoter sequences and a putative Fnr-binding site. Identification of the transcription start sites indicates that transcription occurs in aerobiosis from three constitutive upstream promoters (Pe, Pd, Pc).

50|$|In kinesiology, the {{ventilatory}} threshold (VT1) {{refers to}} the point during exercise at which ventilation starts to increase {{at a faster rate}} than VO2 (V - volume, O2 - oxygen). One's threshold is said to reflect levels of <b>anaerobiosis</b> and lactate accumulation. As the intensity level of the activity being performed increases, breathing becomes faster; more steadily first and then more rapid as the intensity increases. When breathing surpasses normal ventilation rate, one has reached ventilatory threshold. For most people this threshold lies at exercise intensities between 50% and 75% of VO2 max. A major factor affecting one's ventilatory threshold is their maximal ventilation (amount of air entering and exiting lungs). This is dependent on their personal experience with the activity and how physically fit the person is. Comparison studies of more athletic people have shown that your ventilatory threshold occurs at a higher intensity if you are more active or have been training for that exercise; although, in some cases shorter continuous tests can be used because of rapid alterations in ventilation.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, Gaffron and Rubin may be {{credited}} with conducting an experiment that sparked H2 production research in green algae using Scenedesmus obliquus. Algae produce H2 gas under anaerobic conditions by providing hydrogenases with hydrogen ions derived from splitting of water molecules via photosynthesis. However, enzyme activity is transient due to inhibition from O2 production via photosynthesis, {{a problem that}} continues to plague H2 production.S. obliquus is traditionally known to utilize a nickel-iron hydrogenase, but usage of other iron hydrogenases in H2 production is also reported. Hydrogenase enzyme activity of Scenedesmus sp. {{is reported to be}} lower than that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. H2 production independent of Photosystem II in Scenedesmus has also been performed using redox equivalents of fermentative metabolism under dark anaerobic incubation. Research findings suggest that a sulfur-deprived environment triggers an imbalance in the photosynthesis and respiration relationship, resulting in net consumption of O2, causing <b>anaerobiosis,</b> and switching to hydrogen production. Ultrasonication pretreatment has been effective in increasing fermentative bioenergy production from Scenedesmus oliquus YSW15. Bio-hydrogen production research using Scenedesmus is actively spurred by its applications to wastewater treatment. (See subsequent section on waste management by Scenedesmus).|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of <b>anaerobiosis</b> on the formation of Bacillus cereus spores and their resulting properties. For this purpose, an appropriate sporulation medium was developed (MODs). Sporulation of 18 strains from different phylogenetic groups of B. cereus was studied in MODs medium in aerobiosis and <b>anaerobiosis.</b> In <b>anaerobiosis,</b> sporulation ability was weaker and more heterogeneous than in aerobiosis. Among tested strains, B. cereus AH 187 produced {{the highest level of}} spores in <b>anaerobiosis.</b> This strain was therefore chosen to study spore properties. Spores produced in <b>anaerobiosis</b> were more resistant to wet heat at 90 °C, 92. 5 °C, 95 °C, 97. 5 °C and 100 °C. For example, D 90 were 21, 09 1. 70 and 81. 87 2. 00 for aerobiosis and <b>anaerobiosis</b> conditions, respectively. Spores produced in <b>anaerobiosis</b> have a z-value of 7. 70 °C compared with 10. 52 °C for spores produced in aerobiosis. Spores produced in <b>anaerobiosis</b> were also more resistant to 1 M NaOH, 1 M nitrous acid and pulsed light at fluences of 0. 34 J cm- 2 and 0. 49 J cm- 2. No difference in resistance to UV-C, 5 % hydrogen peroxide or 0. 25 mM formaldehyde was observed between these two conditions. In the presence of L-alanine, spores produced in <b>anaerobiosis</b> germinated more efficiently than spore produced in aerobiosis. No difference in germination was observed with inosine as inducer. No difference in the size of spores produced in the different conditions was observed by transmission electron microscopy. However, spores obtained under anaerobic conditions had a damaged exosporium, or in some cases a completely detached exosporium, unlike spores produced under aerobic conditions. This study shows that few spores are formed under anaerobic condition; nevertheless, this condition has an impact on the spore properties of B. cereus AH 187 strain. Spores obtained under anaerobic condition were more resistant to heat and to some chemical compounds. This is an important feature, considering the risk associated with the presence of this pathogen in thermally processed and packaged food in absence of oxygen...|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} {{of a new}} class of mutants permitting facultative <b>anaerobiosis</b> in Neurospora crassa is described. Backcross analyses to the obligate aerobe prototroph (An-) indicate single nuclear gene inheritance (An-/An+). An+ and An- are indistinguishable in morphology and growth rates under aerobic conditions. Anaerobic growth requires nutritional supplements that are dispensable for aerobic growth. Conidiogenesis, conidial germination, and vegetative growth rate are suppressed by <b>anaerobiosis.</b> An+ mutants produce substantial quantities of ethanol under anaerobic conditions. <b>Anaerobiosis</b> and chloramphenicol both affect mitochondrial enzyme activity and morphology. Chloramphenicol inhibition leads to reduction in cytochrome oxidase and swollen mitochondria with few cristae. <b>Anaerobiosis</b> leads to reduction in both cytochrome oxidase and malate dehydrogenase activities, enlarged mitochondria with fewer cristae, enlarged nuclei, and other alterations in cellular morphology. The fine structure of anaerobically grown cells changes with the time of anaerobic growth.

40|$|Proton-equivalent ion {{transfer}} processes between animals and ambient water were determined under normoxic control conditions during <b>anaerobiosis</b> {{and the subsequent}} recovery period in the marine worm Sipunculus nudus L.

The typical initial alkalosis induced by phosphagen cleavage during early <b>anaerobiosis</b> was reflected by a loss of basic equivalents. The acidosis, which developed later, reflecting production of acidic metabolic intermediates, resulted in a relatively small net extrusion of protons into the water. The coelomic acidosis during recovery was greatly exaggerated by the release of protons during phosphagen repletion and by the considerable elevation of PQCH afte r normoxia had been reattained.

40|$|The {{normal habitat}} of enteric {{bacteria}} is largely anaerobic. Expression {{of the three}} characteristic properties of R-plasmids, drug resistance, vegetative replication, and fertility, was therefore studied in Escherichia coli K- 12 during <b>anaerobiosis.</b> Replication and drug resistance functions were not altered in the 45 R-plasmids studies, whereas the expression of fertility varied considerably among different R-plasmids during <b>anaerobiosis.</b> The R-plasmids could be divided into three groups, one showing a strong, the second a moderate, and the third little or no reduction of fertility by <b>anaerobiosis.</b> Plasmid-determined sensitivity to F-, N-, and I-specific phage, respectively, was well, although not absolutely, correlated with each of three groups mentioned. Anaerobiosis-aerobiosis appears to change the fertility of type F R-plasmids by influencing the degree of repression of their fertility functions such as the formation of sex pili.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the impact of <b>anaerobiosis</b> on the growth of two psychrotrophic B. cereus strains exposed to acidic pH at a cold temperature in a laboratory medium. At 10 °C, growth occurred at pH values equal to or higher than 5. 7 during <b>anaerobiosis,</b> whereas aerobic growth was observed from pH 5. 4. Growth rates during aerobiosis were similar at pH 5. 4 and pH 7. No growth was observed for the two tested strains at 8 °C without oxygen regardless of the pH; however, both strains grew at this temperature from pH 5. 4 in the presence of oxygen. These pH growth limits in aerobiosis are consistent with those reported for different strains and different foods or media, but no other studies have described anaerobic growth at acidic pH values. The maximal B. cereus concentration was approximately 6. 0 log 10 CFU/ml for cultures in the absence of oxygen and approximately 8. 0 log 10 CFU/ml for cultures in the presence of oxygen.
