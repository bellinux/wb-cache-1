Spruance and drummer Mike Bordin were also involved, and Patton claimed to have [...] "had to look at <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the face" [...] as a result. The band used art from the graphic novel Flood by Eric Drooker for the album's cover and those of its singles.|$|E

500|$|The band's main songwriter, Thistlethwayte, {{inadvertently}} wrote a [...] "break-up album", which The Sydney Morning Heralds Brett Winterford noted was unusual, [...] "that the {{articulate and}} intelligent 27-year-old has strung together 12 such stock-standard, radio-friendly songs about broken hearts". Thistlethwayte described his influences: [...] "Jazz taught me about spontaneity ... Central to jazz is improvisation. It's also great {{to get that}} knowledge of theory, {{an understanding of the}} geeky side of music" [...] and writing advertising jingles had showed him how to [...] "do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> differing genres and recording styles – but had to try to be authentic about it". After writing the tracks, the other members [...] "choose the songs that had the ultimate emotional impact".|$|E

500|$|In 1995, the McNair and {{the band}} parted ways, with neither party giving a {{definitive}} rationale. Hopper explained [...] "We {{had a hard time}} recording Hot Boxing, because our drummer had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the way... Nobody wants to hurt anyone, or to cut them out, but it was just like four adults getting a divorce, and their child is the band." [...] She has alternately explained that the split was due to the [...] "alternative lifestyles" [...] of McNair {{and the rest of the}} group and that McNair's musicianship was not as competent as the other members. The remaining trio recruited session drummer Josh Freese and engineers Sandy Solomon and Bernie Zwass to record a cover of Tom Waits' [...] "Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis" [...] at Plus Four Recordings Studios, in Sherman Oaks, California in June 1995 for the compilation album [...] Freese joined the group in November–December of that year in Los Angeles, California to record Rubbing Doesn't Help. Mould was unavailable, so the band relocated to Los Angeles and worked with producer Geza X at his home studio in attempt to make a more [...] "eclectic" [...] album that would represent the diversity of their songwriting. After hearing some demos, the band decided to hire him to produce the actual album and moved to Los Angeles for recording. The album produced the singles [...] "Open the Door" [...] and [...] "This Family" [...] (the former also had a music video), as well as the EP Fire All Your Guns at Once. The band immediately set out to tour in promotion.|$|E

She felt that it is almost like the characters should not be friends, but acknowledged that opposites attracted in this instance. Lynsey is attracted to Mercedes as she sees qualities in Mercedes that she wishes she had herself, such as Mercedes being straight-talking, ballsy and someone who [...] "calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto". When Mercedes begins working at the hospital as a cleaner and becomes involved with Doctor Browning (Joe Thompson), Metcalfe explained that the pair gp through everything which is a [...] "real ride of emotions".|$|E

[...] Several days later, music journalist Gary Graff reported that a 'confirmed source within the band' had told him that Ron Thal was no longer in Guns N' Roses and had left after the 2014 tour. No official announcement from Thal or the band has been made regarding his status. Tommy Stinson then left the band, citing personal reasons keeping him unable to tour.

Our relationship, which was the only truly solid relationship in the group, although Matt [...] and I are still great, Ryan [...] and I still briefly talk. I mean, the only way I personally would want to do Mudvayne is if everybody licked their wounds and got over it. There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> that band that tore us apart. Maybe Mudvayne was the martyr for people that stopped supporting music. You sell 159,000 records the first week, and then the next record is like, 'Whatever, f--k it.' Maybe it's a subliminal message if you don't support things... Mudvayne's probably bigger now than it ever was. So, people want what they can't have." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and take <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in....</b> When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E

[...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> my career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off.

2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
