40|$|Quantum {{communication}} with systems of dimension larger than two provides advantages in information processing tasks. Examples include {{higher rates of}} key distribution and random number generation. The main disadvantage of using such multi-dimensional quantum systems is the increased complexity of the experimental setup. Here, we analyze a not-so-obvious problem: the relation between randomness certification and computational requirements of the postprocessing of experimental data. In particular, we consider semi-device independent randomness certification from an experiment using a four dimensional quantum system to violate the classical bound of a random access code. Using state-of-the-art techniques, a smaller quantum violation requires more computational power to demonstrate randomness, which at some point becomes impossible with today's computers although the randomness is (probably) still there. We show that by dedicating more input settings of the experiment to randomness certification, then by more computational postprocessing of the experimental data which corresponds to a quantum violation, one may increase the <b>amount</b> of <b>certified</b> randomness. Furthermore, we introduce a method that significantly lowers the computational complexity of randomness certification.

Though the <b>amount</b> of <b>certified</b> organic land is increasing, the supply of organic foods lags behind demand in the United States. The reasons for this gap include a lack of government support for organics, and the peculiarities of organics as an innovation. In an attempt to close this gap, and increase the environmental sustainability of U. S. agriculture, this paper has two objectives. The first is to document the structural and institutional constraints to organic adoption. This is accomplished through a review of organic programs and policies in the U. S., in particular the National Organic Program. The second objective is to investigate the predictors of interest and the perceived barriers to organic adoption among pragmatic conventional producers in Texas, compared to organic and conventional producers. This is accomplished through a survey of a representative sample of producers in Texas. The results indicate that more than forty percent of producers who currently have conventional operations have at least some interest in organic production (pragmatic conventional producers). There are significant differences among the three groups in their structural and attitudinal characteristics related to organic adoption. For the pragmatic conventional producers, an increase in revenue would be a major facilitator of organic adoption. Their high levels of uncertainty regarding organic production and marketing, and especially organic certification constrain organic adoption. The results also reveal that the institutional setting in the U. S. hindered adoption. The paper concludes that increased institutional support would facilitate organic adoption. organic agriculture; adoption; barriers...|$|R

Comparing host country variables to CDM activity finds that human capital and greenhouse gas emission levels are important determinants of which countries have hosted projects and the <b>amount</b> of <b>certified</b> emission reductions (CER) created. Countries that offered growing markets for CDM co-products such as electricity {{were more likely to be}} CDM hosts, while economies with higher carbon intensity levels had greater CER production. All of these findings work against least developed countries and help to explain the lack of CDM activity in these settings. Meanwhile, case study results of potential CDM projects in a least developed country, Niger, demonstrate that the most common variety of CDM project, renewable energy efforts, do not produce enough emission reductions to justify the CDM registration costs. Forestry projects that sequester carbon offer the best combination in terms of financial returns and the dual goals of the CDM. Unfortunately, a ban on forestry-related emission reductions in the European Union Emissions Trading System has significantly reduced the demand for these types of projects. Policy modifications such as simplified methodologies to reduce registration costs and project bundling to increase CER production would improve the chances for least developed countries to host projects. Through stakeholder interviews, a two-tiered framework of mitigative capacity is applied to Niger to identify impediments to CDM implementation. The framework is also used to analyze a proposed CDM project that is approaching registration. The insights drawn from these applications help to identify successful strategies for navigating through impediments in this setting including targeted capacity building and assistance from outside actors, support for an initial suite of projects, and funding data needs for project registration. These strategies can serve as a roadmap for future efforts in Niger and other least developed countries...|$|R
