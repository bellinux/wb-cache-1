5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were. And I think we showed too much. I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E
500|$|With {{the opening}} of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles became fashionable in London, making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot {{give you a good}} reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, it was {{announced}} that Hammer Films and Dark Horse Comics were producing a four-issue comic book limited series based on the film. Marc Andreyko wrote the comic. The series, titled Let Me In: Crossroads, is a prequel to the film. The first issue has Abby and her [...] "guardian" [...] facing a ruthless real-estate tycoon who wants to steal their home and was released in December 2010. Original author John Ajvide Lindqvist said [...] "Nobody has asked me about [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project stinks. I am looking into this matter and hope that they have no right to do this." [...] Later, he informed fans that he had in fact unwittingly sold the rights for the comic to be made, stating that the producers had misinformed him as {{to the nature of the}} contract he had signed.|$|E

5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy}} to wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what her shows always have is a real sense of optimism <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what we all need today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> came through in the bright patterns <b>and</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> something that she does so well.” ...|$|R

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
500|$|Tom {{establishes}} {{that the}} island has {{some control over}} whether characters can die, as demonstrated when Michael unsuccessfully attempts to commit suicide three times. Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show about what constitutes free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated." [...] Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "the island doesn't let you go until it's done with you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rest of our characters are going to feel the reverberations of that, as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Obviously, {{some of my}} {{personal}} drama was about feeling alone, and feeling like I was searching {{the world for the}} right person". [...] "And {{one of the things we}} want for this song and this record – even though it has personal stuff in it – is to be something everyone can relate to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> concept of people trying to find the right person is something that's universal." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{philosophy}} discovers {{something wrong}} with science, sometimes science has to be changed—Russell's paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley's attack on the actual infinitesimal—but more often it is philosophy {{that has to be}} changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that [...] "philosophical interpretation" [...] is just what mathematics doesn't need.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R

2500|$|Populist {{politicians}} Geert Wilders and Jan Roos {{were the}} only ones reacting positively. Wilders wrote on Twitter [...] "A historic victory! A revolution." [...] He added that: [...] "We also will give our country back {{to the people of the}} Netherlands." [...] The day after the election, Wilders stated that [...] "America regained its national sovereignty, its identity. It reclaimed its own democracy, that’s why I called it a revolution. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of America, as in Europe, feel insulted by all the politicians that ignore the real problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} dramatised in more-or-less this {{form in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. However, even though the 1885–87 Japanese {{exhibition}} in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, [...] "I cannot {{give you a good}} reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea of a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{the tournament}} as {{defending}} champions, Lithuania proved their favoritism by beating Turkey, Croatia and Bulgaria with solid differences {{and an average}} of 88 points. However, the knockout rounds had the team eliminated with an underwhelming performance, scoring only 47 points in a quarterfinal with France. National team coach Antanas Sireika said: [...] "We played the worst game in the championship <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main reason {{of this is that}} the players failed to deal with the psychological tension. This is the main losing reason". The only consolation was the remaining opportunity to qualify into the World Championship, which the Lithuanians achieved by beating Russia and Slovenia for fifth place. Lithuania won 5 of 6 games in the tournament. Consequently, the competition scheme was questioned in its reliability.|$|E

2500|$|Loaded was a {{commercial}} effort aimed at radio play, another {{step away from}} the Warhol-influenced experimental days of their earlier albums. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album [...] "loaded with hits". Singer/bassist Doug Yule said, [...] "On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like {{this is sort of a}} Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss the case. Sharpton began the {{interview}} by commending the [...] "blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community {{to stand up for}} this girl." [...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't know yet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proper {{thing to do is to}} support those that want justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E
