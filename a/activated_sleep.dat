40|$|Sleep {{is known}} to play an {{important}} role in cognition, learning and memory. As Drosophila melanogaster have stable circadian rhythms and behavioral states similar to those of human sleep, they have been a useful model to investigate the effects of sleep on learning and memory. General anesthesia has been shown to cause cognitive impairments in humans. However, anesthesia also induces a behavioral state similar to <b>sleep</b> and may <b>activate</b> <b>sleep</b> pathways. This study examined learning and memory after an acute exposure of isoflurane in a Drosophila mutant model of restless leg syndrome. There were two possible outcomes: isoflurane (an anesthetic) could have impaired cognitive functioning or enhanced learning and memory by <b>activating</b> <b>sleep</b> pathways. Given the acute cognitive impairments often observed postoperatively, we believed the former outcome to be the most likely. Flies with fragmented sleep had impaired performance on an aversive phototaxic suppression learning and memory task compared to wildtype flies. This deficit was rescued with isoflurane exposure, as no differences in learning were observed between mutant and wildtype flies treated with anesthesia. This result suggests that anesthesia exposure can ameliorate impaired learning and memory due to sleep fragmentation. Further investigations are required to determine the type of memory impacted by anesthesia and the mechanisms by which anesthesia induces this effect...|$|R

To enhance security in MANETs, Trust and Reputation Management systems (TRM) have been developed to serve as measures in mitigating threats arising from unusual behaviours of nodes. In this paper we propose a candour-based trust and reputation system which measures and models reputation and trust propagation in MANETs. In the proposed model Dirichlet Probability Distribution is employed in modelling the individual reputation of nodes and the trust of each node is computed based on the node???s actual network performance {{and the quality of the}} recommendations it gives about other nodes.

Amazonian shamans may have made use of this chemical for its visionary properties for thousands of years, and take it as part of a decoction frequently called ayahuasca, which translates from Quechua as "vine of the spirits" or "vine of the dead". The psychedelic brew is taken because it gives rise to extraordinary mental phenomena that have shamanic and supposed healing qualities, such as synaesthesia, ostensible extra-dimensional percepts, out-of-body experiences, psi experiences and, perhaps most commonly, encounters with discarnate entities. When described by independent and seemingly naïve DMT participants the entities encountered tend to vary in detail hut often helong to one of a very few similar types, with similar behavioural characteristics.

The tricyclic antidepressant drug clomipramine suppressed the duration of REM sleep and EEG power density in the frequencies between 1. 5 and 13. 5 Hz in nonREM sleep. During the administration of clomipramine, 24 h of sleep deprivation by forced locomotion significantly reduced the duration of waking and increased the duration of nonREM sleep.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} autobiographical memory (AM) {{activity}} across sleep and wake can {{provide insight into the}} nature of dreaming, and vice versa. Activated memories within the sleeping brain reflect one’s personal life history (autobiography). They can appear in largely fragmentary forms and differ from conventional manifestations of episodic memory. Autobiographical memories in dreams can be sampled from non-REM as well as REM periods, which contain fewer episodic references and become more bizarre across the night. Salient fragmented memory features are <b>activated</b> in <b>sleep</b> and re-bound with fragments not necessarily emerging from the same memory, thus de-contextualizing those memories and manifesting as experiences that differ from waking conceptions. The constructive nature of autobiographical recall further encourages synthesis of these hyper-associated images into an episode via recalling and reporting dreams. We use a model of AM to account for the activation of memories in dreams as a reflection of sleep-dependent memory consolidation processes. We focus in particular on the hyperassociative nature of AM during sleep...|$|R

This suggests that the synaptic release machinery, centered on the highly conserved SNARE complex, is an important target of general anesthetics in all animals.

However, up to this point, {{there has been no}} direct evidence to support this assertion in humans, and the physiological processes supporting such reactivation are unknown. Here, simultaneous electroencephalographic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recordings were conducted during post-learning sleep to directly investigate the spindle-related reactivation of a memory trace formed during motor sequence learning (MSL), and its relationship to overnight enhancement in performance (reflecting consolidation). We show that brain regions within the striato-cerebello-cortical network recruited during training on the MSL task, and in particular the striatum, were also <b>activated</b> during <b>sleep,</b> time-locked to spindles. Interestingly, the consolidated trace in the striatum was not simply strengthened, but was transformed/reorganized from rostrodorsal (associative) to caudoventral (sensorimotor) subregions. Moreover, the degree of the reactivation was correlated with overnight improvements in performance. Altogether, the present findings demonstrate that striatal reactivation linked to sleep spindles in the post-learning night, is related to motor memory consolidation...|$|R

Re-discovery of cue-dependent amnesia, wide availability of functional imaging tools and increased dialog among clinicians, cognitive psychologists, behavioral neuroscientists, and neurobiologists have provided impetus for the search for new paradigms for the study of memory. Memory is increasingly viewed as an open-ended process, with retrieval being recognized as an intricate part of the encoding process. New memories are always made on the background of past experience, so that every consolidation is, in fact reconsolidation, serving to update and strengthen memories after retrieval. Spontaneous reactivation of memory circuits occurs during sleep and there is converging evidence from rodent and human studies that this {{is an important part of}} the extended off-line memory processing. The noradrenergic neuromodulatory system is engaged at retrieval, facilitating recall. The noradrenergic system is also <b>activated</b> during <b>sleep</b> after learning and noradrenergic neurons fire in concert with cortical oscillations that are associated with reactivation of memory circuits.

Nevertheless, designing a WSN requires considering a set of constraints and low energy {{is one of the most}} important of them [1]. From previous approaches we saw that the energy efficiency issue is addressed at different levels, including MAC and network protocols, physical layer communication, operating system, algorithms, etc. All these should be able to dynamically adapt in order to minimize power consumption [2]. Therefore, several optimizations have been proposed such as adaptive modulations and power, MAC protocols such as T-MAC, S-MAC, B-MAC, power aware routing algorithms like SPIN or LEACH, etc [2]. Our implementation is related to cross-layer design which is based on interaction between non-adjacent layers. Such approach can improve energy efficiency by joining design optimizations across hardware, link layer, MAC and routing protocols [2]. Our solution is based on accessing, from the application layer, the services provided by lower layers. These services are available as libraries and they perform power aware operations on the nodes without sacrificing the abstraction of low-level functionality. The power consumption is reduced using two methods: minimizing the communication process as it is one of the most consuming processes within the network, and periodically <b>activating</b> deep <b>sleep</b> mode for the nodes...|$|R

In four cases, EEGs showed posterior spike-and-wave complexes, which were <b>activated</b> by <b>sleep.</b> No patient had status epilepticus or prolonged seizures. Brain MRI revealed colpocephaly and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum and brainstem in four patients; three of them also had hypertrophic massa intermedia. FISH analysis revealed a 6 q terminal deletion in all patients, which ranged between 9 Mb (cases 2 and 3) and 16 Mb (case 4). We suggest that epilepsy associated with 6 q terminal deletions is a new entity. Patients with dysmorphic features associated with focal occipital epilepsy, colpocephaly, and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, thalami, and brainstem should be considered candidates for testing for 6 q subtelomere deletions...|$|R
50|$|Sixty years later, FBI agent John Myers is {{transferred}} to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) {{at the request of}} Broom and he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named Abe Sapien. He learns that a third BPRD member, Liz Sherman, has recently checked into a mental hospital to protect others from her volatile pyrokinetic abilities. Despite regular visits and coaxing from Hellboy, she is determined not to return. Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin in the mountains of Moldova and the three unleash a hellhound known as Sammael. Rasputin imbues Sammael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature's eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Rasputin visits Liz as she <b>sleeps,</b> <b>activating</b> her powers and almost destroying the hospital. Myers convinces her to return to the Bureau.|$|R
