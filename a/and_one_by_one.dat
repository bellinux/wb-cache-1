5|$|Early {{development}} {{for a third}} film began in 2002, with a working title of Fantasia 2006. Plans were made to include The Little Matchgirl by Roger Allers <b>and</b> <b>One</b> <b>by</b> <b>One</b> by Pixote Hunt in the film before the project was shelved in 2004, with the proposed segments released as individual short films.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access {{to all of the}} club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E

5|$|As the laneway {{meant that}} the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also {{had to learn to}} play the ball {{straight}} in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard (using a marble instead of a ball) that sharpened their reflexes, and a miniature bat. All were right-handed batsmen with the exception of Neil. All the siblings attended the nearby George Street State School <b>and,</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens.

5|$|In June 1341, Andronikos III died suddenly, and a power {{struggle}} developed between Kantakouzenos, who initially assumed the powers of regency over Andronikos's underage son John V Palaiologos, and a powerful faction around the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, the Empress-dowager Anna of Savoy and Alexios Apokaukos on the other. The dispute soon developed in outright conflict when the Patriarch, the Empress, and Apokaukos replaced Kantakouzenos as regent and imprisoned his family and supporters. In response, Kantakouzenos proclaimed himself emperor at Didymoteichon in October. The news of Kantakouzenos's proclamation sparked a wave of popular resistance across Macedonia and Thrace. The common people, impoverished by an exploitative and over-powerful aristocracy, viewed Kantakouzenos {{as a representative of}} the hated aristocrats and rallied behind the legitimate Palaiologos line <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one,</b> the cities were seized in the name of the Constantinopolitan regency. Thessalonica at first remained tranquil, and Synadenos contacted his old friend Kantakouzenos with the intention of surrendering the city to him. Such a move might well prove decisive, as possession of Thessalonica would enable Kantakouzenos to control Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, and in March 1342, he set out from Didymoteichon with his army in the direction of the city. Before he arrived there, however, Synadenos was overthrown and driven from the city by a rebellion led by a radical popular faction, the Zealots. Apokaukos with a fleet came to reinforce the new regime, and one of his sons was installed as its new governor.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{war reparations}} to the Soviet Union had been paid, the {{rebuilding}} of the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet began with the commissioning of the new Voima in 1954. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, a series of slightly smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> the old steam-powered icebreakers were decommissioned and scrapped. From 1960 Tarmo was the only state-owned steam-powered icebreaker in service.|$|E

In the story, Oola-boola-woo had six daughters, Mimosa, Wilga, Lilli Pilli, Wattle, Clematis and Geera.

25|$|The Noldor {{for a time}} besieged Morgoth's {{stronghold of}} Angband, {{resulting}} in the Long Peace. This Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time Men arrived over the Blue Mountains.

The initial battle that allowed Morgoth's forces to break free of the Siege of Angband was aptly named Dagor Bragollach, or The Battle of Sudden Flame. Morgoth issued flames and lava from Angband which enveloped the surrounding area. A mighty force was then sent forth to break their centuries long siege.|$|E
25|$|Hazelton {{would later}} {{come under the}} command of Captain Joseph Bucey and would work on the Skeena until 1912 when the {{construction}} of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was completed from Prince Rupert to Hazelton.

25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>by</b> <b>one</b> they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first radio officer, and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning.

Smith sat back and waited for them to finish, then responded {{that there was nothing}} stopping them from going home at any time and living peacefully if they so wished, and that they were in this situation by their own hand. They themselves, he said, had refused the Anglo-Rhodesian accord agreed four years previously, which he said had offered Rhodesian blacks [...] "preferential franchise facilities", and they themselves had chosen to use [...] "unconstitutional means and terrorism in order to overthrow the legal government of our country." [...] The UANC delegates countered by railing against Smith even more strongly than before, repeating their previous arguments and rejecting the right of Britain to negotiate on their behalf. This argument went on for nine and a half hours before the conference broke up, Smith refusing outright to grant diplomatic immunity to the UANC's [...] "terrorist leaders who bear responsibility for... murders and other atrocities". Muzorewa said that he doubted Smith's sincerity in seeking a resolution if he was unwilling to grant such a [...] "very small thing" [...] as immunity to the nationalist leaders.
