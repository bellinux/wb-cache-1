5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> a factor in the reception of the work. Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended.

5|$|As {{they share}} many {{cross-platform}} games and {{compete for the}} same <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> their predecessors, frequent comparisons are made between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The PS3 uses the Blu-ray format, while the Xbox 360 uses a standard DVD9. The Xbox 360 is less expensive to produce, and analysts expect that a mid-revision will allow Microsoft to break-even on manufacturing costs, while industry consensus is that the Xbox 360's conventional architecture is easier to develop for.|$|E
5|$|EastEnders: E20 {{originally}} aired {{as part of}} {{the main}} show's 25th anniversary celebrations. It was devised in a bid to develop and nurture new talent, including writers, actors, composers and remixers, and target a younger <b>audience,</b> <b>as</b> well as to attempt to drive more people onto the Internet. The series was the idea of executive producers Diederick Santer, who wanted a show where regular EastEnders characters would be in the background, and John Yorke, who wanted to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

5|$|The WWE Hall of Fame is a {{hall of fame}} for {{professional}} wrestling personalities maintained by WWE. It was announced on the March 22, 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw where André the Giant, who had died nearly two months prior, was announced as the sole inductee. The 1994 and 1995 ceremonies were held {{in conjunction with the}} annual King of the Ring pay-per-view events. In 1996, the ceremony was held with the Survivor Series event, {{for the first time in}} front of a paying <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> well as the wrestlers, after which, the Hall of Fame went on hiatus.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 to 1914 Jolin {{started to}} paint {{in his own}} naïve {{interpretation}} of Expressionism. By {{the end of the}} 1910s his works became more expressed and the shapes more plastic, but in 1916, Jolin's paintings were still inspired by the years he spent in France. That spring, members of the Konstnärsförbundet (The Artists Association) and their young pupils, were invited to present the new style, Expressionism, to the Swedish <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> exhibition number two (number one being Anders Zorn, Bruno Liljefors and Carl Larsson) at the new art venue, the Liljevalchs konsthall, in Djurgården. Participating in the second exhibition were a number of noted Swedish artists at that time, including Leander Engström, Isaac Grünewald, Gösta Sandels, Birger Simonsson and Jolin who exhibited thirteen paintings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1764, five Cherokee visited Timberlake, seeking an {{audience}} with the governor of Virginia and requesting passage to London. The Cherokee wished to appeal to King George to enforce the Proclamation Line of 1763, which restricted colonists to east of the Appalachians, due to continuing encroachment by white settlers on Cherokee land. The governor denied their request, but Timberlake agreed to help them. He accompanied three Cherokee to London {{in the fall of}} 1764. Not long after their arrival, the benefactor of the trip fell ill and died. Lord Halifax refused to grant the Cherokee an <b>audience,</b> <b>as</b> the trip was unauthorized. Timberlake was accused of attempting to profit off the public attention given to the Cherokee. The government sent the Cherokee back to North America in March 1765. Shortly after their departure, Timberlake was arrested for failing to pay the debt for the last bill for lodging of himself and the Cherokee. He likely wrote his Memoirs while incarcerated.|$|E

5|$|O'Hara {{played the}} love {{interest}} of Henry Fonda in the 1943 war picture Immortal Sergeant. O'Hara noted that Fonda was studying for his service entry exams {{at the time}} and had his head in books between takes, and that 20th Century Fox publicized one of the last love scenes between them in the film as Fonda's last screen kiss before entering the war. She next portrayed a European school teacher opposite George Sanders and Charles Laughton, in their last film together, in Jean Renoir's This Land Is Mine for RKO. At the end of a court case in the film, during a hearty speech by Laughton, O'Hara is shown teary-eyed on screen for a prolonged period. Malone thought her performance was effective, both crying and smiling, though considered Renoir to have overdone the film and confusing the <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> a result.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{combined}} poetic genius with {{a practical}} {{sense of the}} theatre. Like all playwrights of the time, he dramatised stories from sources such as Plutarch and Holinshed. He reshaped each plot to create several centres of interest and to show as many sides of a narrative to the <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> possible. This strength of design ensures that a Shakespeare play can survive translation, cutting and wide interpretation without loss to its core drama. As Shakespeare's mastery grew, he gave his characters clearer and more varied motivations and distinctive patterns of speech. He preserved aspects of his earlier style in the later plays, however. In Shakespeare's late romances, he deliberately returned to a more artificial style, which emphasised the illusion of theatre.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the release}} of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity, {{critical}} acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted a wide adult <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> well as younger readers, and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. The series has also had its share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence it depicts. , the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into seventy-three languages. The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty-four hours of its release.|$|E

5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> well as children.|$|E
5|$|The Broadcasting Act 1990 led to {{the brief}} decline of UK pirate radio by {{encouraging}} diversity in radio and opening up the development of commercial radio. Many pirate radio stations such as the London-based dance music station Kiss FM applied for licenses to the new Radio Authority and went legitimate. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasts has since increased, partly because many non-licensed broadcasters believed that the 1990 Act had actually undermined community-based stations and small scale radio entrepreneurs. Of the pirate radio stations that gained a license in the 1990s, such as Kiss FM, FTP in Bristol, WNK Radio in Haringey and KFM Radio in Stockport, only a few, such as Sunrise Radio in London, remained {{in the hands of}} the original owners. Most have become significantly more mainstream and target a broad <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> a result of commercial pressures to achieve greater audience numbers and a particular audience type sought by advertisers.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Songs chart is {{a record}} chart {{compiled}} by Billboard magazine. Launched on June21, 2003, the chart is ranked by overall audience impressions (the approximate number of audience impressions made for each play, as determined by BDS data cross-referenced with Arbitron listener information). While all Christian radio formats are covered by the Christian Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult <b>audience.</b> <b>As</b> opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E

5|$|The Way I See It was {{released}} by Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, and was initially overlooked by consumers. It sold steadily and spent 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 albums chart, reaching sales of 282,000 copies in the United States by May 2011. It also performed well in European countries such as France, where it charted for 51 weeks. The Way I See It received generally positive reviews from critics and {{was seen as an}} exemplary release of the classic soul revival at the time. It also garnered Saadiq a newer, more diverse <b>audience</b> <b>as</b> he toured extensively in support of the album, performing concerts in the US, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} {{generally}} sold well during its lifetime. The series' strongest sales base has been Japan: in 2007, sales distribution was 87% in Japan, 8% in North America, 3% in Europe and 2% in mainland Asia. The best-selling titles {{of the series}} {{at the time were}} Symphonia (953,000 copies for the GameCube, 486,000 for PlayStation 2), Destiny (1.1 million copies for PlayStation), Xillia (1 million copies for PlayStation 3) and Destiny 2 (977,000 copies for PlayStation 2). The sales data did not include mobile and online games. The success of entries has also been linked with the consoles they are released on: Vesperias release on the Xbox 360 caused the console to sell {{out for the first time}} in Japan, while Namco decided to release Zestiria on the PlayStation 3 due to the low sales prospects for next-gen consoles in their target <b>audience.</b> <b>As</b> of December 2013, the series has shipped 16 million units worldwide across 100 different countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Werblin's co-owners {{gave him}} an ultimatum– either buy them out or be bought out. He chose the latter option, {{reportedly}} profiting $1.4million for his 1963 investment of $250,000. Prior to Werblin's departure, the Jets had considered firing Ewbank. They attempted to secure Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, but Lombardi decided to remain in Green Bay one more season. The season started with the usual three road games due to the team's status as secondary tenant to the Mets at Shea Stadium. The Jets rose {{to the top of}} the AFL East; they had lost only two games by mid-November and built a three-game lead over second-place Houston. New York's next game was at Oakland. In what became known as the Heidi Game, the Jets took a 32–29 lead with 68seconds left, only to have Oakland score two touchdowns to win the game. However, the touchdowns went unseen by much of the national TV <b>audience,</b> <b>as</b> NBC had switched at 7:00p.m. to a TV movie of Heidi. Nevertheless, the Jets won their remaining games to finish 11–3. In the playoffs, the Jets defeated the Raiders for the AFL Championship at Shea Stadium, 27–23, a game in which Namath threw three touchdowns, including the game winner to Don Maynard in the fourth quarter.|$|E
