5|$|The {{life span}} of T. fluviatilis is 2–3 years. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few snails was {{estimated}} to be 3.5 years. The mortality rate is low in summer. However, it is higher in winter because ice and storms can dislocate the substrate, which can result in mechanical damage to the snails.|$|E

5|$|As of the 2006 census, 48.3 {{percent of}} {{residents}} were male and 51.7 percent were female. 24.3 percent were 19 {{years old or}} younger, 27.4 percent were between 20 and 30 years old, and 34.0 percent were between 40 and 64 years old. The average <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Winnipegger in May 2006 was 38.7, compared {{to an average of}} 39.5 for Canada as a whole. Between the censuses of 2006 and 2011, Winnipeg's population increased by 4.8 percent, compared to 5.2 percent for Manitoba as a whole. The population density of the city of Winnipeg averaged 1,430 people per km2, compared with 2.2 for Manitoba.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} {{cities and towns}} in the United Kingdom, the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of the {{buildings}} in Chew Stoke, including the church, school, and several houses, reflects {{the long history of}} the village. For example, Chew Stoke School has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils attend Chew Valley School. These two buildings were built in 1858 on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718. The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> snake.|$|E
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To determine the amount of Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E

5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dugong.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids. Analysis of bone {{histology}} can determine the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specimen when it died. Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph. Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles, tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives. After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity, growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. A tyrannosaurid growth curve is S-shaped, with the maximum growth rate of individuals around 14 years of age.|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bog turtle is determined by {{counting the number of}} rings in a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} was lavishly decorated with colourful Byzantine-style mosaics, cornices, and ceramics. With {{the exception of}} the Corinthian and Doric column capitals, which are of Roman or Byzantine origin, the rest of the decoration was created specifically for and during the church's construction. Vlasto finds a Proto-Bulgarian flavour in the church's interior and a relationship with the art of Persia or Central Asia. Thus, he believes that it is not based on Byzantine examples of that <b>age.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>a</b> contrary opinion is Miyatev, who points out significant similarities between the decoration of the Round Church and that of the Church of the Mother of God (now part of the Fenari Isa Mosque) from 908 in Constantinople. Mavrodinov goes a step further to claim that the architect of the Round Church was directly inspired by ancient examples, citing in particular the rich sculptural decoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E

5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence <b>age,</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sample whose activity has been measured by beta counting, {{the ratio of}} its activity to {{the activity of the}} standard must be found. To determine this, a blank sample (of old, or dead, carbon) is measured, and a sample of known activity is measured. The additional samples allow errors such as background radiation and systematic errors in the laboratory setup to be detected and corrected for. The most common standard sample material is oxalic acid, such as the HOxII standard, 1,000lb of which was prepared by NIST in 1977 from French beet harvests.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1s first {{images of}} Io {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} impact craters, suggesting a very young surface. Craters are used by geologists to estimate the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planetary surface; the number of impact structures increase with {{the age of the}} planetary surface. Instead, Voyager 1 observed a multi-coloured surface, pockmarked with irregular-shaped depressions, which lacked the raised rims characteristic of impact craters. Voyager 1 also observed flow features formed by low-viscosity fluid and tall, isolated mountains that did not resemble terrestrial volcanoes. The surface observed suggested that, just as Peale and colleagues had theorized, Io was heavily modified by volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have {{prominent}} horn-like structures called ossicones, {{which are}} formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularized, the ossicones {{may have a}} role in thermoregulation, and are also used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges {{at the front of the}} skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple sinuses. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.|$|E

Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults. Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for Daspletosaurus; this would change {{the magnitude of the}} growth rate but not the overall pattern.|$|E
