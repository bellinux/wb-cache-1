40|$|This paper {{considers}} Aspect-based Opinion Summarization (AOS) of reviews {{on particular}} products. To enable real applications, an AOS system needs to address two core subtasks, aspect extraction and sentiment classification. Most existing approaches to aspect extraction, which use linguistic analysis or topic modeling, are general across different products but not precise enough or suitable for particular products. Instead {{we take a}} less general but more precise scheme, directly mapping each review sentence into pre-defined aspects. To tackle aspect mapping and sentiment classification, we propose two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods, cascaded <b>CNN</b> <b>and</b> multitask <b>CNN.</b> Cascaded CNN contains two levels of convolutional networks. Multiple CNNs at level 1 deal with aspect mapping task, <b>and</b> a single <b>CNN</b> at level 2 deals with sentiment classification. Multitask CNN also contains multiple aspect <b>CNNs</b> <b>and</b> a sentiment <b>CNN,</b> but different networks share the same word embeddings. Experimental results indicate that both cascaded <b>and</b> multitask <b>CNNs</b> outperform SVM-based methods by large margins. Multitask CNN generally performs better than cascaded CNN...|$|R
