For example, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) utilizes an [...] "entity's business model for managing the financial assets" [...] as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its financial instruments accounting standard, IFRS 9. In their 2013 proposal for accounting for financial instruments, the Financial Accounting Standards Board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments. The concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under International Financial Reporting Standards with 2010 <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 12 addressing deferred taxes related to investment property.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{paper is}} a {{response}} to the exposure draft of proposed <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 1 Presentation of Financial Statements published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in March 2006. The objective is to bring to the standard setter's attention research that is relevant to the issues raised in the exposure draft. We review analytic, empirical and experimental research that addresses the presentation of income and the format of the income statement. Overall, there is some support for a single statement of (total) recognised income and expense. However, net income is on average more relevant than comprehensive income, which may favour a two-statement approach. While this result is in line with the IASB's option of the two formats, it does not support the IASB's preference for a single statement. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{reform of}} {{international}} accounting standards, {{as a consequence}} of the process of harmonization of European accounting systems, involves significant changes to the financial instruments that affect all types of enterprises. Both the equity and liabilities of cooperatives, added to the impact of their very definition, should be considered in the light of the specific characteristics of their application in participating companies. An important debate arose when share capital was first considered as an instrument of debt in IAS 32, which was developed in the IFRIC 2 interpretation, although this was later questioned in the draft of <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 32 by the IASB. Reform in Spain seems to ignore this controversy. The aim of this article is to provide a critical yet constructive approach with alternative proposals for the classification and accounting of share capital in cooperatives, reviewing opinions that go against the initial proposals of international standards and the Spanish solution.

It first provides a brief analysis of IAS 39 and fair value accounting for financial instruments. It then sets out the relationship with the Basel II banking regulatory regime. The main part of the paper is a chronological presentation of the events of 2008 as they impact upon the international standard-setting institution.

40|$|Background: On 1 January 2009 <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 1 {{concerning}} {{the presentation of}} comprehensive income came into force. The amendments were one outcome of the IASB’s performance reporting project {{with the purpose of}} enhancing the usefulness of information presented in the income statement. It is now required to present certain items, referred to as other comprehensive income, in a statement of comprehensive income which can be either a single statement or two statements where net income and other comprehensive income are presented separately. Research objectives: We examine whether the presentation of other comprehensive income provides useful information. Additionally, we examine whether the one or two statement approach to comprehensive income reporting is more appropriate in providing investors with information. These issues will be examined from the perspective of producers and users of financial statements respectively. Research design: The attitude of producers to comprehensive income reporting is examined by means of an annual report study, a study of comment letters and an interview with one producer whereas the attitude of users is examined by means of a statistical association study. Limitations: The annual report study examines the time period 2008 – 2009 and is restricted to the Swedish market whereas the statistical study examines the time period 2006 – 2010 and focuses on European markets. Throughout the paper, ‘users’ refers to investors. Empirical findings: Our results suggest that producers do not consider other comprehensive income relevant in evaluating firm performance but that users take it into account, although they regard net income as more value relevant. Accordingly, the IASB’s requirements regarding comprehensive income reporting can be considered legitimate in terms of enhancing the usefulness of information available to investors. Our results indicate that other comprehensive income contains useful information for evaluating firm performance, but that net income is much more value relevant. Hence, the two statement approach to comprehensive income reporting may seem appropriate. Further research: Further research could clarify differences in attitudes to other comprehensive income between producers and users. Additionally, it could examine whether the importance of other comprehensive income has increased over time after the <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 1 came into force. It could also control for parameters not taken into account in this paper that might impact the perceived relevance of other comprehensive income...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMeasurementas value {{determination}} is {{very important}} in the field of property and financial sources reporting. The choice of measurement base influences all accounting information necessary for making decisions by investors, creditors, suppliers, employees and other subjects in order to realize their plans. The paper aims, firstly, to characterize the processes of evaluation of biological assets and agricultural produce in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 41 in its current wording; secondly, to present the results of research conducted within the project SGS 2013 - 040 titled “A paradigm of development in the 21 st century and its influence on the behaviour of economic agents”, and, finally, to compare the findings with the solutions contained in Exposure Draft ED/ 2013 / 8 Agriculture: Bearer Plants (Proposed <b>Amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 16 and IAS 41), which was published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) for comments to be received by 28 th October 2013. In the paper the results of the research, conducted through a questionnaire survey on a sample of 104 agricultural enterprises, will be compared with the IASB's proposed solutions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to verify the hypothesis that can be formulated as follows: The opinions of most respondents, participating in the questionnaire survey are rather restrained as for the use of value measurement of biological assets and agricultural produce and therefore are not inconsistent with a solution adopted in the aforementioned Exposure Draft...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{subsequent}} measurement of financial instruments under IAS/IFRS. After giving {{an overview of the}} general approaches to the subsequent measurement of financial instruments and some background on the development of IAS 39, this paper first {{deals with the}} current provisions of IAS 39. The paper then presents and discusses the proposed changes to subsequent measurement as suggested by the Exposure Draft on proposed <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 32 „Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation“ and IAS 39 „Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement“ (ED) issued in summer 2002. Especially the issue whether those proposed changes may alleviate the need {{for the use of the}} specific hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 will be discussed. In summary, the reasons for some of the proposed changes in subsequent measurement are sometimes far from being convincing. While, for example, the changes in designation may overall be welcomed, especially the removal of reversals of impairment for available-for-sale financial instruments departs significantly from the treatment of impairment in other IAS and leads to inconsistencies within IAS 39. In general, with respect to hedge accounting the IASB is well short of target. Even minor changes which could ease the implementation of the standard without touching the fundamental concepts were obviously not even considered (e. g. lowering the ex ante hedge effectiveness level. required, introducing the short cut method, removal of the restriction of portfolio/index hedging etc.). financial instruments, IAS 39, international accounting, measurement issues...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{fair value}} {{to measure the}} worth of {{biological}} assets allows discretionary choices when using discounted cash flow {{in the absence of}} an active market, influencing the quality of accounting information. The objective of this study was to investigate evidence of earnings management among Brazilian companies that have adopted fair value based on the discounted cash flow method. The firms were investigated with regard to: a) disclosure of the discount rate, b) BM&FBovespa corporate governance levels; and c) adherence to disclosure requirements in the Brazilian accounting standard CPC 29 (IAS 41). We analyzed 31 firms with significant biological assets from 2010 to 2012. The earnings management measurements were calculated according to the modified Jones, the Teoh, Welch and Wong (1998), and the KS models. The Mann-Whitney test of the means was applied and revealed evidence of greater earnings management for companies that use discounted cash flow, and the ones that least meet CPC 29 disclosure requirements, considering the KS model estimates. Regarding the other proposals, testing did not offer enough evidence of differences in discretionary accruals. In this sense, only hypotheses 1 and 4 are partially accepted, demanding more research in this area. We also present evidence in favor of adopting Exposure Draft ED/ 2013 / 08 Agriculture: Bearer Plants, Proposed <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 16 and IAS 41, which proposes to measure biological assets at cost, because firms already following these rules showed lower earnings management in this study...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{apparent}} global economic conditions, {{at the end}} of 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement and IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures in October and November, 2008. The amendments allow banks to reclassify their non-derivative financial instruments in rare circumstances. This thesis investigates whether banks in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) reclassify financial instruments, in their financial statements of 2008 and 2009. The result of the study shows that 47 % of the sample Nordic banks reclassified financial instruments in 2008 and 12 % in 2009. All banks increased their net profit as a result of reclassifying financial instruments in 2008. The return on equity (ROE) increased significantly compared to whether the banks would not had reclassified their financial instruments. Tendencies found among the sample Nordic banks are that larger and less profitable banks used the possibility to reclassify financial instruments to a greater extent. Because none of the banks made losses on their choice to reclassify in 2008, the conclusion is that the opportunity given due to the amendments are mostly used by the banks to enhance the net income and the key ratio ROE. This shows that management decisions are short-term. This also indicates that the amendments may be misused by management to enhance current profit for their own benefit. The thesis also concludes that the departure from fair-value as the valuation method for financial instruments, due to recent massive critic, is unlikely...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{background}} to the problem: The IASB and FASB started a joint project in April 2004 on financial statement presentation {{with the goal}} of further developing convergence of international standards. Proposed <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 1 resulted in a revision of the standard in September 2007, which came into force in January 2009. The new presentation requires all owner changes in equity to be separated from non-owner changes, and a statement of comprehensive income was introduced due to the revision. Most research regarding comprehensive income concludes that it is not considered superior compared to other measures, with a few exceptions. Furthermore, previous research also discusses that comprehensive income might contribute useful information for the users of financial statements. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is twofold: first to come to an understanding of which income measures analysts use and if this is consistent with IAS 1; second to assess whether the IASB's view on what is needed to achieve enhanced usefulness of the financial statements is in line with what analysts use and demand. Limitations: This thesis focuses on analyst reports concerning firms listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, which follows the IFRS, since it is relevant for the thesis to study information about firms who produce their financial statements according to IAS 1. Furthermore, the periods these analyst reports concern are 2006 - 2007 and 2010 - 2011. Method: This study employs both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The main part of the empirical investigation is performed through an investigation of analyst reports. Furthermore, the study of analyst reports is supplemented by qualitative interviews with analysts. Results and conclusions: The investigation of analyst reports provided evidence that analysts hardly use CI at all when creating their forecasts, and {{the fact that most of}} the respondents do not use CI in a great extent, it may indicate that the IASB's motivation regarding the revision of IAS 1 do not correlate with analysts' demands...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of financial reporting is to provide users with useful information for decision-making. Standard-setters, such as the IASB, have therefore added to disclosure requirements in attempts to increase the level of transparency. However, transparency comes with a cost and information overload is a current perception of the outcome. The disclosure problem {{is the result of}} poor application of the concept of materiality. The underlying challenges are that there is not enough relevant information, too much irrelevant information, and that the communication of information is poor. As a consequence, entity-specific information is lost, and users view disclosures as generic and boilerplate. To show how materiality is applied in practice, this study investigates the reasoning behind disclosure decisions in financial statements. Since materiality is entity-specific, a case study in a single organization is performed. Further, this study employs both a qualitative and quantitative approach with interviews and an investigation of financial statements. While the interviews show the reasoning behind disclosure decisions, the aim of the investigation of financial statements is to show the outcome and development of disclosures. The findings of this study show that several determinants impact disclosure decisions. These are the materiality of items, internal and external actors, disclosure requirements from accounting standards, unchanged assumptions, and how information is constructed in other firms and accounting standards. These determinates impact disclosure decisions differently due to an underlying cost-benefit approach undertaken by firms. However, the findings indicate that this might {{have a negative impact on}} disclosure quality since the cost-benefit approach is conducted at the cost of the best reflection of the underlying economic situations at firms. This, in turn, questions the strength of enforcement in principles-based standards. The findings also show that the <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>IAS</b> 1 have impacted the preparer’s disclosure decisions and resulted in a decrease of copied words from IFRS. However, the general view on IASB’s work on materiality is mixed. A question is raised and remains unanswered; whether an entity-specific concept such as materiality can, or should, be defined. Instead, the study shows a need for clarification on the purpose of financial statements and its users. MSc in Accountin...|$|E

The following two results are special cases of the main theorems in the present paper: (1) If R is a Noetherian integral domain, then there exists a finite integral extension ring A of R such that the nilradical of IA is projectively equivalent <b>to</b> <b>IA.</b> (2) If also R contains a field of characteristic zero, then there exists a finite free integral extension ring A of R for which the nilradical of IA is a projectively full ideal that is projectively equivalent <b>to</b> <b>IA...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Ia alloantigens and xenoantigens detected by immunosuppressive heterologous anti-lymphocyte sera has been investigated. Three rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte sera were examined {{for the presence}} of antibodies <b>to</b> <b>Ia</b> antigens. Two of these sera, an anti-thymus membrane and anti-lymphocyte sera detected labelled cell-surface Ia antigens (mol. wt 35, 000 and 27, 000) present on rat spleen B cells. The third antiserum, prepared against fractionated soluble lymphocyte antigens, was essentially non-reactive with these antigens. Of these three heterologous antisera, the anti-membrane serum reacted with the same antigens detected by two alloantisera. It seemed possible that such an antiserum could modify a recipient animal's immune response in vivo in a fashion identical <b>to</b> alloantibody <b>to</b> <b>Ia</b> antigens. In fact, all three heterologous antisera, including one devoid of antibody <b>to</b> <b>Ia</b> proved immunosuppressive in vivo. These results suggest that antibodies to antigens other than Ia can induce prolonged allograft survival. Since heterologous sera bind Ia antigens, it remains to be determined whether monospecific heterologous antisera <b>to</b> <b>Ia</b> antigens can allograft survival. The results raise the prospect that more than one antibody specificity may contribute to the immunosuppression achieved with ALS...|$|R
