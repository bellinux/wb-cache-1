500|$|The {{result of}} the {{election}} was announced on 17 December 2011 and saw Lamont secure an overall majority with 51.77% {{of the vote in}} the first round. Her closest rival was Macintosh with 40.28%, while Harris was third with 7.95%. Lamont also won majorities in two groups of Labour's three-tier electoral college system, securing the support of parliamentarians and <b>affiliated</b> <b>bodies</b> such as trade unions. Macintosh was backed by the majority of individual party members. In her acceptance speech, Lamont told party activists, [...] "Together we will change the Scottish Labour Party and win the chance to serve the people of Scotland again and make Scotland all that we know it can be." [...] On the same day, MP Anas Sarwar was elected to the position of Deputy that Lamont had vacated.|$|E
500|$|Voting {{took place}} between 17 November and 10 December using the three-tier electoral college system, which gives parliamentarians, {{individual}} members, and <b>affiliated</b> <b>bodies</b> such as trade unions an equal say in the outcome. During this time, the candidates toured Scotland {{for a number of}} hustings meetings, at which they set out their direction for the party if elected. Policy options raised were centred on issues such as health, education, employment, and the prospect of further devolution to Scotland. The three leadership candidates were from different wings of the party–Murphy from the Labour right, Boyack from the centre, and Findlay from the left. Controversy ensued when the Unite trade union issued a mock ballot paper instructing members on which candidates to elect, and when two prominent Labour figures engaged in an argument about the contest on social media. On 13 December, Murphy was elected to lead the party, while Dugdale was chosen to become his deputy. In his victory speech, Murphy said that his election was a [...] "fresh start" [...] for Scottish Labour.|$|E
500|$|Anas Sarwar {{announced}} {{details of}} the timetable for the contest on 26 October 2014, following a meeting of Scottish Labour's executive committee. Potential candidates would be invited to declare their interest from the following day, with nominations open from 31 October to 4 November. Balloting would begin on 17 November, and {{the announcement of the}} new leader would occur on 13 December. Sarwar said that voting would be held using the three-tier electoral college, in which three groups – individual party members, parliamentarians, and <b>affiliated</b> <b>bodies</b> such as trade unions – each make up a third of the electorate. Plans to change Scottish Labour's electoral system to a one-person, one-vote ballot like that of the UK Labour Party were under review {{at the time of the}} leadership contest, but as forging ahead with these changes before the election of a new Scottish leader would delay the process, the decision was taken to use the existing method instead. Explaining this decision on the day the contest was announced, Sarwar told BBC News, [...] "We have had unanimous agreement to get the balance right between moving quickly to elect a new leader and also allowing a period of time to have an open, frank and honest debate about the future direction of the Scottish Labour party." [...] The deputy leadership contest followed the same timetable after Sarwar relinquished that role.|$|E

500|$|An {{international}} {{design competition}} was {{launched by the}} Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institute of Civil Engineers, and their <b>affiliated</b> <b>bodies</b> throughout the British Empire, because the Minister for Home Affairs, King O'Malley insisted that the final decision was {{for him to make}} rather than an expert in city planning. A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him, but they could not reach unanimity. On 24May 1911, O'Malley came {{down on the side of}} the majority of the board, the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin of Chicago, Illinois, United States being declared the winner. Second was Eliel Saarinen of Finland, and third was Alfred Agache of Brazil but resident in Paris, France. [...] O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. [...] On 25November 1912 the board advised that it could not support Griffin's plan in its entirety, and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising, incorporating the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913. [...] In 1913 Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began. On 23 February King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.|$|E
