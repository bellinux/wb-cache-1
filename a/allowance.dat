5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash <b>allowance</b> for those under {{the rank of}} {{lieutenant}} (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the <b>allowance</b> is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the <b>allowance</b> is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension benefits are exempted from income tax. In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|E

5|$|Men with {{wives and}} dependents found it {{difficult}} to support their families. Beyond a small <b>allowance,</b> the men did not get paid for their service, nor were their dependents given an <b>allowance.</b> To be closer to their husbands, women sought employment near their husband's assignment. Later, when jobs on dairy farms became available, families could live together in housing provided for farm workers.|$|E

50|$|The RGGI {{states have}} also {{established}} a Cost Containment Reserve (CCR) of CO2 <b>allowances</b> {{that creates a}} fixed additional supply of CO2 <b>allowances</b> that are only available for sale if CO2 <b>allowances</b> prices exceed certain price levels - $4 in 2014, $6 in 2015, $8 in 2016, and $10 in 2017, rising by 2.5 percent each year thereafter. The CCR was 5 million CO2 <b>allowances</b> in 2014, and 10 million CO2 <b>allowances</b> each year thereafter.|$|R
30|$|With 149.2 million <b>allowances</b> {{allocated}} for free (see above), airlines {{will need to}} buy <b>allowances</b> for about 74.4 million tonnes of CO 2 -emissions. Taking into account the estimated price span of 25 € to 40 € for <b>allowances,</b> the cost for the acquisition of <b>allowances</b> will be between 1.9 and 3.0 billion € for the entire aviation sector subject to the EU-ETS (in 2012). The results also show that CO 2 <b>allowances</b> for about 48.1 million tonnes {{will have to be}} purchased by aircraft operators from other sectors, as only 175.5 million new <b>allowances</b> will be available to the aviation sector on the basis of Directive 2008 / 101 /EC.|$|R
40|$|Slotting <b>allowances</b> are fees paid by {{manufacturers}} {{to get access}} to retailers’ shelf space. Both in the USA and Europe, the use of slotting <b>allowances</b> has attracted attention in the general press as well as among policy makers and economists. One school of thought claims that slotting <b>allowances</b> are efficiency enhancing, while another school of thought maintains that slotting <b>allowances</b> are used in an anti-competitive manner. In this paper, we argue that this controversy is partially caused by inadequate assumptions of how the retail market is structured and organized. Using a formal model, we show that there are good reasons to expect anti-competitive effects of slotting <b>allowances.</b> We further point out that competition authorities tend to use an unsatisfactory basis for comparison when analyzing welfare consequences of slotting <b>allowances.</b> slotting <b>allowances,</b> retail competition, anti-trust policy...|$|R

5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual <b>allowance</b> (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the <b>allowance</b> if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's <b>allowance</b> from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} is the claimed possibility of non-existent emission reductions being recorded under the Kyoto Protocol {{due to the}} surplus of <b>allowances</b> that some countries possess. For example, Russia had a surplus of <b>allowances</b> due to its economic collapse {{following the end of}} the Soviet Union. Other countries could have bought these <b>allowances</b> from Russia, but this would not have reduced emissions. Rather, it would have been simply be a redistribution of emissions <b>allowances.</b> In practice, Kyoto Parties have as yet chosen not to buy these surplus <b>allowances.</b>|$|R

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters.

To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily <b>allowance</b> and a ration card, the <b>allowance</b> being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks.

40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts of meal voucher sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features of the Czech meal voucher scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison of the Czech meal voucher system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects of meal <b>allowances</b> on various income deciles, quantify the impact of meal <b>allowances</b> tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment of current meal <b>allowances</b> by flat meal <b>allowances</b> according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the meal <b>allowances</b> tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form of meal <b>allowances</b> widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent households receive meal <b>allowances</b> more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement of current meal <b>allowances</b> scheme by one with a flat meal <b>allowances</b> (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|R
