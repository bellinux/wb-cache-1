5|$|Delahaye {{was one of}} many gardener-botanists {{employed}} on European colonial voyages {{of scientific}} exploration in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Their duty was to assist with the collection, transport, cultivation and distribution of economic plants. They worked with the naturalists on these expeditions, but gave particular assistance to the botanists by collecting live plants <b>and</b> <b>seed,</b> as well as plant specimens for herbarium collections. They often maintained journals and records of their collections and made observations on the vegetation encountered during the voyage. On this particular expedition, Delahaye assisted the naturalist and botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de Labillardi√®re‚Äîwho accumulated one of the largest herbarium collections of that era and published what was, in effect, the first Flora of Australia based on the collections he made on the New Holland (Australian) leg of the expedition. Delahaye also made numerous botanical collections of his own.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with drooping leaflets <b>and</b> <b>seed</b> branches in 'hands' of 3‚Äì5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E
5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem.

They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2‚Äì2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering <b>and</b> <b>seed</b> release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
