5|$|So {{there is}} an {{infinity}} of values which <b>are</b> <b>possible</b> candidates {{for the value of}} i'i, one for each integer k. All of them have a zero imaginary part so one can say i'i has an infinity of valid real values.|$|E
50|$|Ain Wazein grotto has {{beautiful}} calcareous formations {{found in}} its passages and sides. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to organize scientific tours {{for high school}} and university students. This <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> because all geologic elements are clear in the grotto. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> also to carry out scientific research on its structural features.|$|R

5|$|Weather {{conditions}} often change rapidly, {{and afternoon}} thunderstorms {{are common in}} the summertime; hailstorms and snow <b>are</b> <b>possible</b> year-round. An electrical storm on the mountain's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science.|$|E
5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{argument}} for ex nihilo creation comes from Claude Nowell's Summum philosophy that states before anything existed, nothing existed, and if nothing existed, {{then it must}} have <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> for nothing to be.

5|$|Based on what rank Cole holds {{at the end}} of InFamous, two endings <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> If Cole defeats Kessler as a Hero, he restores {{peace to}} Empire City and is hailed as a savior. Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya, coupled with the {{responsibilities}} of heroism, lead him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to slip further into chaos, and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to be the strongest to ever exist.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere. The planar Apollonius problem can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse stereographic projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere.
