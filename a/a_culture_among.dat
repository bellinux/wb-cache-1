If the horse used to be naughty and disobedient they used to bring it to Hazrat Qutubuddin. Qutubuddin used to take a small ride on it and the horse would become obedient. Once a horse that would not let anyone even touch his back was brought to him. Qutubuddin sat on the horse at one go and went for a ride. The horse tried vigorously to get him dashed on any wall, tree, or, any solid surface but all its {{attempts}} went in vain. Qutubuddin pushed his thighs slightly and the horse started gasping but kept on behaving badly. Qutubuddin at last got down, lifted the horse and thrashed him on the ground. This incident occurred near Ghandhi Maidan (it was then known as Church ka maidan (field)). Oldham, the then District collector of Gaya was sitting in his garden, was shocked to see this happen and remarked [...] "Is he a man or a giant? He lifted and thrashed the horse on the ground with his hands!".|$|E

30|$|If we {{look into}} {{the root of the}} social {{practice}} of property distribution in Bangladesh, we notice that it results from the misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the Islamic system (Mohammad 2013). The inheritance property was distributed among the Muslims in Bangladesh based on Islamic law (Kamal 2015). However, over the course of time people violated the Islamic laws. Some of them practice part of Islamic law of property distribution. Eventually, it became <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>among</b> the people of Bangladesh (Bulbul 2013) leading some to believe that the social practice of property sharing is the Islamic law. Based on this, some people urged changing the Islamic property sharing law. However, the Islamic property sharing system is far different from the social practice in Bangladesh. The Islamic property law is based on fairness and justice while the social model is based on injustice between male and female (Mohammad 2013).|$|E

40|$|Reading is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most critical skills for learners to succeed in their academic pursuits. In view of this, this study attempts to find various strategies to inculcate the reading culture in learners. Methodologically, the study is premised within the community engagement project of the researcher through observation and informal interviews. The study shows that reading is a serious problem among learners partly because of the high illiteracy rate and partially because of the use of First Additional Language as the language of teaching and learning. The study used critical Discourse Analysis within interpretivism to bring out the perspectives of the researcher on how reading could be made exciting among the learners. The findings showed that there is need for parents, teachers and the community at large to motivate reading among learners for they say charity begins from home. Furthermore, it was suggested that once an interest in reading is developed and the learners have a positive attitude towards reading, then it can become <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>among</b> them. The study concludes that reading needs to be taught as social practice so as to reduce the level of anxiety among the learners...|$|E

So, lahure practice has been developed as <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> <b>among</b> them. This research has tried to analyze the impact of British Gurkha recruitment on the higher education of Gurung young men. The social value of being a lahure and an educated professional in the Gurung community is a major discourse of the study. The study {{is based on the}} field work carried out in Pokhara Sub-metropolis. It is basically qualitative in nature and interview was adopted as the main tool to collect the necessary information. Being a lahure is a matter of great craze among the Gurung youths. The socio-cultural circumstances also encourage them to try for recruitment. There is high social value of being a lahure in the Gurung community in contrast with getting higher education. The educational attainment of the Gurung youths is inter-related with these social values. It has an adverse effect on the educational status of the Gurung youths. The educational achievement of the Gurung community would have been far better if the community was not dominated by the pro-lahure culture.

The result of this study showed that there are three meanings according to Roland Barthes 2 ̆ 7 s semiotic, dennotative meaning that seen in the scenes of ToBa Dreams is representating Batak Toba through the actors/actress, literal meaning from dialogues, nature condition, Tourist attraction at Toba Lake, and monuments of the custom home and typical graves of Batak Toba.

This, in its turn, shows the enhancement possibilities it provides for participating teachers, both professionally and personally, and for students, in the improvement of teaching and learning in the classroom. The dissertation opens with a glance at education in Ireland to date in relation to the topic of collaboration / networking.

The attitudes and perceptions of these ANR agents in overall programming efforts will be extremely important for adoption and further dissemination of Emergency Preparedness and Management education to all clientele; therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine what Extension ANR agents perceived as advantages and obstacles associated with the organization and implementation of Emergency Preparedness and Management education and the necessity for establishing local animal issues committees. The study population was Texas AgriLife Extension Service ANR agents. The agents were from both rural and urban counties, in various stages in their careers and various stages of the organization, facilitation and implementation of Emergency Preparedness and Management education and animal issues committee establishment. An online instrument was developed based on a review of related literature. The instrument had 19 total question sets pertaining to the 4 objectives of the study and included matrix, multiple choice and yes/no questions. Questions to obtain demographic information (gender, age, Extension affiliation, years of employment with Extension, and county size) were also asked. Results indicated ANR agents felt Extension should be involved in the organization, planning and implementation of educational efforts in Emergency Preparedness and Management and also the establishment and maintenance of Animal Issues Committees. ANR agents indicated Extension?s best approach would be to help identify innovators, adopters and the resources needed for Emergency Preparedness and Management and Animal Issues Committees. The success or failure of educational programming for Emergency Management depends on the help or assistance that is provided by the key stakeholders and agencies in counties. From this study, it is apparent local stakeholder and agency involvement has been an advantage and obstacle for Texas AgriLife Extension ANR agents in the state of Texas...|$|E
