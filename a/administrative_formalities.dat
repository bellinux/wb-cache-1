40|$|The {{questions}} concerning the use of individual action plans at labour offices represent a highly charged issue, mainly {{in connection with the}} current system requiring that applicants for jobs who have been registered at a labour office for more than 5 months be compulsorily included in the action plan. Therefore, I set out to deal in detail with two domains in this Bachelor?s degree dissertation. The key aim of this work is firstly to map the job mediation consultants' opinions of whether the individual action plan increases the chances on the job market and secondly to find out whether the individual action plan makes the consultants? and job applicants? cooperation easier. The theoretical part of this contains theoretical definitions of this issue including related topics. The information necessary for this work was amassed by a qualitative research through directed interviews with the staff of the Czech Republic?s Labour Office at České Budějovice, Český Krumlov and Kaplice contact points. I interviewed six job mediation consultants and one job consulting department manager. The interviews took place from June to August 2011. The results of the research show that the job mediation consultants to a large extent agree that the individual action plan does not increase the applicant?s chances on the labour market and does not benefit the applicant. Most of the people interviewed regard this consulting tool as a mere <b>administrative</b> <b>formality</b> and claim that it does not provide clients with activities not available without any IAP in place. The results of the work also show that it does not make the job consultants' cooperation with the clients significantly easier and can only, as the consultants hold, be used as a constraint forcing the client to join in the project and as a means to perform the active steps listed in this document...|$|R

In this paper we go further into this question and investigate the heterogeneity of this effect depending on firms’ characteristics and on different indicators measuring the accessibility of destination countries (time and number of documents necessary to export to the country, weighted demand and riskiness). Our results show that an increase in the number of neighboring exporters has a greater impact on the probability that a firm starts exporting when the targeted country is riskier, is characterised by a lower weighted demand and imposes numerous and costly <b>administrative</b> <b>formalities</b> for foreign exporters. ...|$|E

European unification would considerably reduce the burden of <b>administrative</b> <b>formalities</b> that hold back telemedicine in France, and would lead to the emergence of community-based, non-hospital-dependent eHealth projects, in line with recommendations in the literature. The creation of cooperation protocols and the formal recognition of the patient’s role via therapeutic education are valuable tools for achieving this goal. It would be an error to dismiss these tools because of the overly rigid regulations, especially now that financial incentives are shifting from cure to care...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{reflection}} of aspects and factors in social work within the agenda of benefits in material distress, affecting {{the human rights of}} clients of social workers of HN at CoP LO. The scope of ordinary social workers of HN at CoP LO on the agenda of benefits in material distressis the processing of applications, providing advice and appropriate services, which affect both legislative, ethical and other documents of the organization, as well as the role of social workers in their work representing their competence, attitudes and values that imply to intervention with clients. Other aspects and factors that have a relevant impact on the human rights of clientsare the cooperation with other entities active in the environment and working conditions of social workers. Research of the thesis was through quantitative methods in the form of semi-standardized interview focused on mapping and factors that affect the implementation of the rights of clients. Questions have been targeted on subjective perceptions and opinions of the respondents in the area of benefits in material distress in Ceske Budejovice, regarding examined aspectsand factors that I have outlined above. The result of my thesis is the finding that the fulfilment of the rights of clients is negatively affected by the high administrative participation rates of social workers, which subsequently affects the individual approach, roles, competencies, values of social workers, and in cooperation with other agencies and organizations that are important to the saturation ofclients' needs. Officers of benefits of benefits in material distress from the position of the first-line workers do not have sufficient powers in defending the rights of their clients.

This is also considered {{as some sort of}} de-judicialization and the owners of such documents do no need to attend the courts as plaintiff and prove their claims and also they are not required to pass the formalities and the long procedures of trials and having such documents at hand they can refer to the notary enforcement circles or the notary public offices {{to take advantage of the}} rights justified for them therein. It is in this manner that they should first observe the rules of formal documents enforcement approved and ratified in the indispensable formal documents rules of procedure and the other sanctioned regulations. In the present study, the formative and the natural issues pertaining to the indispensable formal documents and the ordinary documents which can be enforced as ruled by the law (such as cheques) via the notary enforcement circles and transiently via the judicial courts will be investigated. The author’s intention of writing the present research paper has been, firstly, the elaboration of the legal principles and concepts of indispensable formal documents, explication of the formative and the natural issues related to the indispensable formal documents enforcement and the ordinary documents which can be enforced as decreed by the law, as well as the expression of the <b>administrative</b> <b>formalities</b> and the legal processes such documents are required to undergo in public notary offices (enforcement unit), and, secondly, the exposition of the study subject matter from the legal status perspective of documents enforcement through notary enforcement and, finally, there is this possibility that after a judicial writ of execution is issued the obliged individual or the third party may have objections regarding the judicial writ of execution issuance or the executive operations. Therefore, their objection rights should be accepted and taken into consideration regarding the judicial writ of execution or the executive operations based on the relevant statutory cases and this is analyzed in the fourth chapter of the present study. It is necessary to explain that justice ministry courts are sometimes qualified to deal with the objections to the judicial writ of execution issuance or operations and this is exactly the very topic of “special legal regime”...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWithin the MEDNET project “Mediterranean Network for Custom Procedures and Simplification of Clearance in Ports” {{funded by}} the MED {{programme}} (2007 – 2013), Taranto Port Authority (TPA) in Italy has designed and developed newly automatic system (prototype) for an effective and seamless management of port operators enrolment and access in the port area. Taranto Port Authority developed and tested an effective Information Technologies (IT) based on a multi-user management tool with a single interface for all port operators. The interface is based on functionalities coming from the integration and re-engineering of two different procedures managed by TPA: 1) enrolment in the TPA's Register foreseen in art. 68 of the Italian Navigation Law, mandatory for all private companies and individuals operating in the port; 2) the procedure of issuing of passes for vehicles and people to enter in the port area. The scope of this initiative was to re-engineer the two aforementioned procedures into a single IT based procedure with a single management interface. It enables to accelerate the process for passes release {{as well as to}} improve port accessibility by reducing the number of potential errors and transforming the nature of the procedure from “preventive” to “fact-finding”. In this way, the port community of Taranto will be able to provide relevant services in less time. The prototype is able to speed up the issuing of passes for persons and vehicles entering in the port area by reducing the time needed to check documents provided by companies as well as informing relevant authorities. The developed prototype enables to automatically manage different categories of passes for entering in the port of Taranto: annual passes, provisional passes as well as visitors passes. The combined effect of the new local regulation (TPA's Ordinance no. 04 / 14 of April 28 th 2014) and the prototype enables to issue passes in 7 – 8 days against the previous 60 days required to complete (annual) pass request procedure. The benefits in terms of time saving have been also achieved for the other categories of passes (provisional and visitors). The prototype leads to seamless procedures management as well as to simplification of checks in entering in the port area. Streamlining procedures enables not only a reduction in terms of needed time for regular control of requests, but also a real-time control of the handled requests in parallel with the traditional ways (paper protocols). Taranto Port Authority {{as well as the other}} competent bodies are now able to check each single person and vehicle accessing in the port of Taranto, improving actual procedure and related controls, through an efficient check-in/check-out reporting. Seamless <b>administrative</b> <b>formalities</b> related of both companies’ enrolment and passes requests enable to reach an overall improvement of port accessibility and transit of vehicles and goods in the area, positively affecting its competiveness as well as quality of provided added-value services. The prototype is able to significantly reduce relevant administrative and bureaucratic aspects. Simplification of the procedures is expected to positively influence the door-to-door transport time and costs for business accessing and circulating in the port area and beyond...|$|E

Anhand einer Voruntersuchung über die Arbeit von Familien- und Sozialpflegehelferinnen (AFS), eine Tätigkeit, die der der Krankenpflegehelferin in Frankreich entspricht, in einer öffentlichen Einrichtung zur häuslichen Betreuung von Pflegefällen (MAD) in Quebec, konnte die tatsächlich geleistete Arbeit als auch die von den Entscheidungsträgern aufgezwungene Struktur der Arbeitsorganisation dokumentiert und analysiert werden. Die Ergebnisse dieser interdiziplinären Untersuchung, an der Arbeitswissenschaftler und Soziologen beteiligt waren, zeigen, dass die emotionale und geistige Komponente dieser Pflegetätigkeit genauso wichtig ist wie die physische Komponente und auch nicht von ihr getrennt werden kann. Ferner zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass diese wichtige Arbeitskomponente der AFS verschiedene Geschicklichkeiten und Fähigkeiten erfordert, die jedoch von der Dienstleitung nicht anerkannt werden, da sie zur Wahrnehmung «unsichtbarer» Aufgaben genutzt werden. Diese Tendenz lässt sich bereits für die Ausbildung feststellen, die in erster Linie auf die Ausubung physischer Tätigkeiten ausgerichtet ist, die - wie gemeinhin angenommen - den Kern dieser Pflegearbeit dar- stellen. So lernen die AFS erst durch individuelle oder kollektive Erfahrungen das notwendige Know-How zur Wahrnehmung dieser nicht offensichtlichen Aufgaben. Diese Fähigkeiten, die feinere und komplexere Strategien im Umgang mit dem Zeitdruck erfordern, helfen den AFS aber doch nicht ganz, sich den Folgen einer zu starken Belastung zu entziehen. Sie versuchen also den Zeitdruck durch andere individuelle Strategien zu kompensieren, die sie auf privater Ebene teuer zu stehen kommen : nicht deklarierte, zusätzlich verbrachte Zeit bei den Patienten, zusätzlich zu Hause anfallende Zeit zur Bewältigung von Verwaltungsarbeit, Teilzeitarbeit, jeden Abend körperliche Schmerzen, hohe berufliche Verletzungsrate trotz ihrer Ausbildung im sicheren Umgang mit Patienten. Die AFS leisten einen beachtlichen Beitrag im Rahmen der häuslichen Betreuung. Die Entscheidungsträger sollten sich dessen bewusst werden und diesen Pflegedienst so organisieren, dass diese «verdeckten» Fähigkeiten voll ausgeschöpft werden können. Esther Cloutier, Hélène David, Catherine Teiger and Johane Prévost, The {{ability of}} {{experienced}} social and family workers to handle severe time constraints and health risks. In {{a recent study}} on the activity {{of a group of}} social and family workers (whose status {{is similar to that of}} hospital aids) working for a public home health care department in Quebec, the tasks actually performed by these workers were documented and the effects of public decisions on the way their work was organized were analysed. The results of this multidisciplinary research project, in which ergonomie and sociological approaches were combined, showed that the emotional and mental components of the care dispensed by these people are as important as the physical ones, from which they are inseparable. They also show that these components of the work require several skills and abilities, although these are not recognized by the decision-makers, since they serve to perform invisible tasks. This minimization of vital aspects is also reflected in these workers' training, which focuses mainly on the physical tasks which are assumed to constitute the main part of their job. They therefore acquire the know-how required to perform the invisible tasks only as the result of individual and collective experience. Despite frequent recourse to delicate and complex time-management strategies, these family and social workers inevitably suffer from the consequences of their excessively heavy workload. They attempt to compensate by adopting other individual strategies at their own personal expense : spending extra time with their patients for which they are not paid, completing <b>administrative</b> <b>formalities</b> at home rather than during working hours, and going onto part-time employment. They often suffer from physical pain at the end of the day, and occupational lesions have a high rate of occurrence among these workers, although they are trained how to manipulate their patients safely.

Une recherche exploratoire sur le travail des auxiliaires familiales et sociales (AFS), emploi équivalent à celui d'aide-soignante, d'un service public de maintien à domicile (AAAD) au Québec a permis de documenter et d'analyser leur activité réelle de travail de même que sa structuration par les modalités de l'organisation du travail imposées par des décisions politiques. Les résultats de cette recherche multidisciplinaire, associant l'ergonomie à la sociologie, font voir que la composante affective et mentale de ce travail de soins est aussi importante que la composante physique et en est inséparable. Ils indiquent aussi que cette importante composante du travail des AFS requiert plusieurs habiletés et compétences, mais celles-ci ne sont pas reconnues par les gestionnaires, puisqu'elles sont utilisées à réaliser des tâches invisibles. Cette occultation touche aussi la formation qui est surtout axée sur les tâches physiques qu'on croit être l'essentiel de ce travail. C'est donc surtout par l'expérience, individuelle et collective, que les AFS développent les savoir-faire nécessaires à l'exécution de ces tâches invisibles. Illustrées par le recours à des stratégies fines et complexes de gestion du temps, ces compétences ne permettent toutefois pas aux AFS d'échapper complètement aux conséquences d'une charge trop lourde. Elles compensent donc par d'autres stratégies individuelles coûteuses sur le plan personnel : temps supplémentaire non déclaré auprès des patientes, temps supplémentaire à domicile pour compléter leurs tâches administratives, travail à temps partiel, douleurs physiques quotidiennes en fin de journée, taux de lésions professionnelles très élevé malgré une formation à la manipulation sécuritaire des patients. La contribution des AFS à la mission du AAAD est majeure. II importe donc que les gestionnaires en prennent conscience et organisent le travail du service de façon à pouvoir recourir pleinement à ces compétences cachées.
