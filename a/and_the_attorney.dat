5|$|The {{manner in}} which {{certain aspects of the}} case were {{reported}} by the British media led to television broadcaster ITN being temporarily banned from attending press conferences, and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates' former landlord, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that votes are cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
5|$|No country {{recognised}} the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively {{returned to}} power in the first election held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise election victory in the UK. Edward Heath took over as Prime Minister while Douglas-Home became Foreign Secretary. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Sir Peter Rawlinson flew to Salisbury on 15 November for negotiations over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.|$|E

25|$|In June 1982, a Cabinet {{committee}} {{had been set}} up to look at local government finance, on which Brittan sat.

25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> General who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E

25|$|As {{scientific}} evidence {{mounted in the}} 1980s, tobacco companies claimed contributory negligence as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility.
