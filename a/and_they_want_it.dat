2500|$|The {{impact of}} boho {{illustrated}} certain broader trends in what Shane Watson {{referred to as}} [...] "the way we dress now": that fashion was increasingly being dictated, not by the main houses, but what Watson called [...] "the triple-F crowd" [...] (the F referring to the f's in [...] "famous and fashion-forward"), of which Kate Moss, Lindsay Lohan and Sienna Miller were exemplars. Once they had spotted new fashions, young women were not prepared to wait a season for them to become available and, consequently, the familiar boundaries between summer wear and that for autumn and winter were becoming blurred. As Jane Shepherdson, brand director of the clothing chain Topshop, put it, [...] "when Sienna wore that gilet, we had to pull them forward fast ...

The making of a theatrical success {{is a much more}} complicated and curious thing than such persons fancy it to be. Immense are the pains taken to get a good word from Mr. This of the Star, or Mr. That of the Courier, to propitiate the favour of the critic of the day, and get the editors of the metropolis into a good humour,--above all, to have the name of the person to be puffed perpetually before the public.

[...] This piece of intelligence the Hammersmith Observer will question the next week, as thus:--"A contemporary, the Brentford Champion, says that Blazes is engaged to give Shakspearian readings at Windsor to [...] "the most illustrious audience in the realm." [...] We question this fact very much. We would, indeed, that it were true; but the MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AUDIENCE in the realm prefer FOREIGN melodies to THE NATIVE WOOD-NOTES WILD of the sweet song-bird of Avon.

We've got to go back on the side of pure science--literature untrammeled by the preconceptions of the social schemers--art free from the urgency of immediate utility--and a new, a regal, a god-like sincerity in philosophy. And, above all, we've got to stop this Jackdaw buying of yours, my dear, which is the essence of all that is wrong with the world, this snatching at everything, which loses everything worth having in life, this greedy confused realization of our accumulated resources!

The proposed division of the two bands relates to the history of the destruction of Gwayasdums in 1856 when the surviving Kwicksutaneuk of that village were mostly taken in by the Mamalilikulla, and subsequent Indian Reserve Commissions by Peter O'Reilly and other actions and documentation by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs effectively amalgamated the two peoples as one band.

50|$|Undeniably, the Boyce {{train station}} is a {{surprisingly}} large building {{for a community}} the size of Boyce. It was {{much bigger than the}} Berryville (county seat) station, constructed at about the same time. The reason for such an elegant station can probably be attributed to the wealth of many of the local citizens around Boyce and Millwood. Early in the twentieth century, Clarke County experienced an influx of wealthy settlers from the west <b>and</b> north. <b>They</b> were drawn to the county {{because of the presence of}} fox hunting, cheap land, and good climate.

It has amazing cameos, and genius script twists that it keeps you interested for long enough". Ghana Celebrities comments: [...] "The writers paint a picture that's relatable to the audience", [...] "No matter what caste or class you find yourself in, whether a socialite in Lagos or a pauper in the slums of Nima-Ghana, these are themes you can identify with".

CherryChatter commends the character development, music and states: [...] "…the series captures the face of new Lagos; paying homage to the 'new' career paths, articulating the angst and generally lending itself to defining who the new Lagosian is". [...] "Lagos was presented as such a beautiful and vibrant city; the director's ability to capture the essence of contemporary Lagos was completely spot on - It showed a Lagos I was familiar with". Idara Owodiong-Idemeko of Culture Custodian commended the choice of soundtrack, but faulted the sound mixing, She gave a rating of 8.8 out of 10 stars and concluded by stating: [...] "Jadesola Osiberu has birthed real life characters that are relatable in every way.

40|$|Abstract We {{wanted to}} {{investigate}} how the Danish Peoples party {{could get the}} success they got. The party had gained a lot of negative response on their immigration and refugee policy, but they still only gained more mandates for the parliament from each election. We saw the party as a populist radical right party, {{so we wanted to}} analyze it as one, by using different theories as under categories to populism in general. We use populism theory as the main course of how the Danish people party gained their success and next we used nationalism, globalization, fear and a “you and them” theory. To analyze the party we used speeches from their year meetings and one from constitution day. Furthermore we used statistics to show the success they got in mandates for the parliament since they started as a party. We can conclude that they gained their success by using a lot of fear in their speeches and nationalism, and that’s a classical sign of a populism party. The Danish people party see the Danish population as homogenous <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to stay that way, by using the point of nativism. Some of the biggest under categories of their success to populism, we conclude is fear and nationalism(nativism) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Title: Engelska (Svenska) Number of pages: 40 (47 {{including}} appendix) Author: Carl Strand Tutor: Göran Svensson Course: Media and Communication Studies C Period: Fall 2005 University: Division of Media and Communication, Department of Information Science, Uppsala University Purpose/Aim: The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyze how young people, in the ages 18 to 25, relate {{to the subject of}} file sharing, and what their attitudes to this phenomenon are. I aim to describe how they use file sharing, their knowledge about it, how their usage have changed due to the new copyright law, what their stands are on the question of resource control and management on the Internet, and what they think of the future of file sharing. Material/Method: The method being used is a qualitative focus group interview model, used to investigate how young people look at the subject of file sharing. The results of the interviews is then applied to a theoretical framework based on thoughts of Denis McQuail, Lawrence Lessig concerning creativity, copyright, resource management and file sharing on the Internet Main Results: My conclusion is that the widespread file sharing habits of young people is not only caused by the temptation of getting free stuff, but of the lack of commercial and legal alternatives. Youths {{are willing to pay for}} media if the distribution is superior to the illegal file sharing alternative. They are a generation of young people that has grown up in a society where the tendency in many fields has been to make everything faster and more effective.
