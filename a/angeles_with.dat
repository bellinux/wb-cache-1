5|$|Recorded in Los <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> {{producer}} David Schiffman, {{the album}} was initially released on October 20, 2009, by Indica Records in Canada.

5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los <b>Angeles</b> <b>with</b> Rubin.

This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E
