25|$|Effective {{management}} of allergic diseases {{relies on the}} ability to make an accurate diagnosis. Allergy testing can help confirm or rule out allergies. Correct diagnosis, counseling, and avoidance advice based on valid <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> results reduces the incidence of symptoms and need for medications, and improves quality of life. To assess the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, two different methods can be used: a skin prick test, or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended, and they have similar diagnostic value.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} chronic {{urticaria}} can rarely be determined. In some cases regular extensive <b>allergy</b> <b>testing</b> {{over a long}} period of time is requested in hopes of getting new insight. No evidence shows regular <b>allergy</b> <b>testing</b> results in identification of a problem or relief for people with chronic urticaria. Regular <b>allergy</b> <b>testing</b> for people with chronic urticaria is not recommended.|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of allergic diseases in childhood has increased considerably in developed {{nations in the}} last 2 - 3 decades, and accordingly the need of <b>allergy</b> <b>testing</b> has increased steadily. Hong Kong is also facing similar challenge. <b>Allergy</b> <b>testing</b> is an important prerequisite for both early identification of infants at increased risk of allergic disease and for specific allergy treatments. In this review, we shall discuss the <b>allergy</b> <b>tests</b> currently practised in Hong Kong. We have made practical recommendations to local practitioner for <b>testing</b> <b>allergy</b> related dermatological problems. It is desirable to strengthen the co-operation between the specialist sector/hospitals and general practitioners in order to let the right children get the right tests at the right time. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Determination of specific IgE to alpha-gal testing is commercially available. The highest sensitivity is observed with skin and basophil activation tests with cetuximab which is, however, limited by its high costs.|$|E

50|$|Many {{people have}} no idea that they have OAS. However, if swelling, {{tingling}} or pain develops while eating certain foods, then it is wise to see an allergy specialist. Before a diagnosis can be made, keep a food diary. This is important as the physician can then perform an <b>allergy</b> <b>test.</b> Before testing is started, a comprehensive history is obtained so that random testing is avoided. The diagnosis of OAS may involve skin prick tests, blood tests, patch tests or oral challenges. When OAS is suspected, the oral challenge test is ideal.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{research}} on these topics is extrapolated from studies on laboratory workers, however there are a few specific studies for zoo employees. Most studies have been in the form of voluntarily questionnaires. Using tools including the skin prick test,a skin <b>allergy</b> <b>test,</b> zoo employees were identified to have allergies or not. In these studies, {{the research}}ers took into account confounding variables such as pet presence at home. They also accounted for duration of work with animals. This study determined significant allergic reaction for employees who work with parrots.|$|E
50|$|Antihistamines, {{which are}} {{commonly}} used to treat allergy symptoms, interfere with skin tests, as they can prevent the skin from reacting to the allergens being tested. People who take an antihistamine need either to choose a different form of <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> or to stop taking the antihistimine temporarily before the test. The period of time needed can range from {{a day or two}} to 10 days or longer, depending on the specific medication. Some medications not primarily used as antihistamines, including tricyclic antidepressants,phenothiazine-based antipsychotics, and several kinds of medications used for gastrointestinal disorders, can similarly interfere with skin tests.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the active}} {{ingredients}} is PPD, p-Phenylenediamine, which can cause a reaction in some people. Studies have shown that less than 5% of the population may experience some allergy, which can range from minor irritation, rashes and swelling to burning, though severe reactions are rare. [...] Manufacturer directions instruct users to do a 48-hour skin <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> prior to use to detect and avoid any reactions. PPD was voted Allergen of the Year in 2006 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. [...] Henna based products are a non-permanent alternative, though come with similar allergy risks of their own.|$|E

50|$|With {{respect to}} P. digitatum, this species {{is known to}} cause {{generalized}} mycosis in humans, although the incidence of such events are very low. Various studies have also noted a presence of circulating antibodies to the extracellular polysaccharide of P. digitatum in both human and rabbit sera. This presence is suggested {{to be due to}} the intake of contaminated fruits and/or breathing air contaminated with extracellular polysaccharide. In terms of allergy testing, P. digitatum is present in various clinical <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> formulations, testing for allergy to moulds. There has been one case report identifying P. digitatum as the cause of a fatal case of pneumonia through molecular methods.|$|E
5000|$|Allergy testing {{can help}} confirm or rule out allergies and {{consequently}} reduce adverse reactions and limit unnecessary avoidance and medications. Correct allergy diagnosis, counseling and avoidance advice based on valid <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> results {{is of utmost}} importance and can help {{reduce the incidence of}} symptoms, need for medications and improve quality of life. A healthcare provider can use the test results to identify the specific allergic triggers that may be contributing to the symptoms. Using this information, along with a physical examination and case history, the doctor can diagnose the cause of the symptoms and tailor treatments that will help the patient feel better. A negative result can help the doctor rule out allergies in order to consider other possibilities. Ruling out allergies is as important as confirming them to limit unnecessary avoidance, worry and negative social impact.|$|E
5000|$|House (Hugh Laurie) is {{convinced}} {{that one of the}} actors on his favorite soap opera [...] "Prescription: Passion" [...] (guest star Jason Lewis) has a serious medical condition after observing his symptoms on television. House decides to intervene, kidnaps the actor and convinces him to run a test, but both the actor and House’s own team dismiss House’s assessment and do not believe there is anything wrong with him. However, the actor develops more symptoms: His leg goes numb preventing him from leaving the hospital, and after subsequent tests and more symptoms he eventually goes into a coma. The team gives him antibiotics for a possible infection, but when this has no effect House has an epiphany and administers steroids for a floral allergy. The steroids work but the floral <b>allergy</b> <b>test</b> comes back negative. Not until after the actor has been discharged does House realize that he is allergic to quinine from the tonic water in the fake gin and tonics that he has to drink on set.|$|E

50|$|<b>Allergy</b> <b>testing</b> {{may reveal}} the {{specific}} allergens {{to which an}} individual is sensitive. Skin testing {{is the most common}} method of <b>allergy</b> <b>testing.</b> This may include a patch test to determine if a particular substance is causing the rhinitis, or an intradermal, scratch, or other test. Less commonly, the suspected allergen is dissolved and dropped onto the lower eyelid as a means of <b>testing</b> for <b>allergies.</b> This <b>test</b> should be done only by a physician, since it can be harmful if done improperly. In some individuals not able to undergo skin testing (as determined by the doctor), the RAST blood test may be helpful in determining specific allergen sensitivity. Peripheral eosinophilia can be seen in differential leukocyte count.|$|R
