40|$|The Philippine Sea {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic oceanographic environments in world; moreover, the {{seafloor}} is rough. These two factors lead to doppler and range (time) spreading of forward scattered signals. ONR supported <b>an</b> <b>multiyear</b> experiment, PhilSea_ 09 / 10 / 11, where a water column vertical array (DVLA) by SIO, a towed array (FORA) MPL/SIO, SOFAR axis sources (T 1 – T 6) (SIO), J 15 a moored and towed source (MIT & WHOI), and a SOFAR channel source (MP 200) (U of Wash). All the sources and receivers were designed to operate in the 50 – 500 Hz band. The long term objective of the experiment is to characterize the short and long term variability of signal propagating in the Philippine Sea. A second long term goal is to measure the horizontal directivity of the ambient noise. OBJECTIVES The short term variability useful for charcterizing the performance of a sonar system can be specified by the scattering function. This function specifies the spreading terms of how a signal randomly redistibutes itself in a range (travel time) – doppler plane. This redistribution can be calculated as the two dimensional convolution of the signal ambiguity function and the scattering function in the range – doppler plane.
