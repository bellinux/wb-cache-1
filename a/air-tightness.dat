5000|$|The overbend is a {{difficult}} technique to master. To facilitate overbending, many players use specially modified or customised harmonicas.

The primary needs are tight tolerances between the reed and reed-plate and a general level of <b>air-tightness</b> between the reed-plate and comb. The former often necessitates lowering the [...] "gap", the space between the tip of the reed and the reed-plate. Another often used technique called embossing is to make the space between the sides of the slots in the reed-plate and the reed itself as small as possible by drawing in the metal {{on the sides of the}} reed-plate slots towards the reed. While these modifications make the harmonica overbend more easily, overbending is often possible on stock diatonic harmonica, especially on an airtight design.|$|E
50|$|In the hot season, solar {{radiation}} predominates {{as the source}} of heat gain. Radiative heat transfer is related to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (measured in degrees Kelvin = degrees Celsius + 273.16; Stefan-Boltzmann law). Therefore, such transfer is at its most significant when the objective is to cool (i.e. when {{solar radiation}} has produced very warm surfaces). On the other hand, the conductive and convective heat loss modes play a more significant role during the cooler months. At such lower ambient temperatures the traditional fibrous, plastic and cellulose insulations play by far the major role: the radiative heat transfer component is of far less importance and the main contribution of the radiation barrier is in its superior <b>air-tightness</b> contribution.In summary: claims for radiant barrier insulation are justifiable at high temperatures, typically when minimizing summer heat transfer; but these claims are not justifiable in traditional winter (keeping-warm) conditions.|$|E
50|$|There is dispute among players {{about whether}} comb {{material}} affects {{the tone of}} a harmonica.

Among those saying yes {{are those who are}} convinced by their ears. Few dispute, however, that comb surface smoothness and <b>air-tightness</b> when mated with the reedplates can greatly affect tone and playability. The main advantage of a particular comb material over another one is its durability. In particular, a wooden comb can absorb moisture from the player's breath and contact with the tongue. This can cause the comb to expand slightly, making the instrument uncomfortable to play, and to then contract, potentially compromising air tightness. Various types of wood and treatments have been devised to reduce the degree of this problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{responding}} to the recent framework convention on climate change, {{and the rise of}} the need for energy efficient buildings, such as Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB), domestic insulation standards and energy conservation regulations are being reinforced, to prevent heat loss. Accordingly, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport have made amendments in Chapter 21 “Enforcement regulations for building facilities standards etc. ”, and Chapter 22 “Energy conservation standard”, to reflect these changes. To effectively implement these regulations, it is required to propose <b>air-tightness</b> test methods, and establish <b>air-tightness</b> standards, based on the air leakage characteristics of domestic apartment housings. This research has been done primarily to collect basic technical data, to provide guidance for the establishment of domestic <b>air-tightness</b> standards for new apartment housing, through studying <b>air-tightness</b> test methods, field measurement on <b>air-tightness</b> of new apartment housings, and air leakage characteristics of major developed countries...|$|E
40|$|In Sweden, {{the energy}} usage in {{existing}} residential buildings amounted to 147 TWh in 2012, equivalent to almost 40 % {{of the final}} overall national energy usage. Among all the end users in building service sectors, 60 % of the final energy in Sweden is used for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production in 2013. In {{order to reduce the}} supply temperature for space heating in existing buildings, combined approaches are favorably adopted: to reduce the net energy demand by <b>air-tightness</b> and insulation retrofits; and renovate the conventional high temperature heating to low temperature heating (LTH) systems. As an energy-efficiency alternative, LTH technology has shown promising advantages and shortcuts to improve the coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pump system, which further saves primary energy. However, existing modeling achievements and field testing reveal that the attained application of LTH has a relatively high requirement to the <b>air-tightness</b> in new constructed single-family houses. Moreover, in some leaky multi-family building stock with low envelope surface temperature, LTH may have limited energy saving potentials. How to evaluate the impact of <b>air-tightness</b> for the LTH implementation and energy saving potentials in existing houses are not sufficiently attained so far. This paper presents a modeling approach combining LTH simulation with <b>air-tightness</b> evaluation, aimed to estimate whether the selected existing building types can cope with LTH with upgraded primary energy savings. In addition, the impact of <b>air-tightness</b> retrofits for LTH implementation in selected Swedish residential buildings is of interests. In the simulation Consoli Retro are employed to simulate the energy performance. It is revealed that the combined effect of floor heating/ ventilation radiators and <b>air-tightness</b> retrofits to 1 / 1. 5 ACH can contribute 19 % to 36 % primary energy savings in total. However, different LTH systems and archetypes have varies sensitivities to <b>air-tightness</b> retrofits.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a conference paper. Nowadays, {{buildings}} {{are responsible for}} the 40 % of energy consumption (36 % of greenhouse gas emissions) in the European Union. The European Council pointed out the need to refurbish a large amount of the existing building inventory, as new buildings are related to the 1 - 2 % of the total energy consumption. Air-infiltration and tightness of buildings are usually neglected parameters during retrofitting or building design, especially in the Southern European counterparts, where <b>air-tightness</b> standards are absent from the national building regulations. To this effect, this study investigates the impact of tightening existing residential envelopes, focusing on the impact to the default construction and synergies arisen between <b>air-tightness</b> and other interventions (i. e. thermal insulation). The study was undertaken in the Mediterranean climate conditions, examining detached houses located in Cyprus. This is the first study in national level, presenting the <b>air-tightness</b> characteristics of buildings as these were collected by a blower door test. In general, the outcome shows that the improvement of <b>air-tightness</b> primarily reduces the energy associated with winter thermal loads.

This paper reports on the air permeability test results of 287 post- 2006 new-build dwellings in the UK. The paper explores the relationships between <b>air-tightness</b> and its influencing factors including build method, dwelling type, management context, design target, season, number of significant penetrations, and envelope and floor area. One-way ANOVA analysis was utilised to compare means of air permeability {{in relation to the}} individual factors, and two- and three-way ANOVA analyses were applied for examining the interactions between them. The <b>air-tightness</b> of the dwellings averaged 5. 97 m 3 /(hm 2) at 50 Pa, which has improved from UK historic data. Dwellings built using precast concrete panels were significantly air-tighter than those built using timber frame, whilst those masonry and reinforced concrete frame dwellings were most leaky. Greater extent of innovative practice and 'self-build' procurement led to achieving superior <b>air-tightness.</b> Interaction was observed between 'build method' and 'dwelling type' and between 'dwelling type' and 'management context'. A modest positive correlation was noticed between air permeability and design target, which became weak in relation to the number of significant penetrations and envelope area. Applying the linear regression technique a predictive model is developed for estimating air permeability of dwellings. This model integrates the influencing factors and their significant interactions. The findings should contribute to future research in predicting impacts of controlling the influencing factors on achieving <b>air-tightness</b> of dwellings more consistently. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Energy saving is {{strongly}} affected by air leakages which also influence IAQ. Particularly, several {{studies show that}} the <b>air-tightness</b> energy losses contribution of the windows ranges up to 40 %, with a value 15 % higher than that predicted by the ASHRAE. Such values confirm the high influence of the windows and the possibility to significantly reduce heat losses by ventilation by only operating on the windows. Furthermore, inefficiency of windows is often combined with unsealed rolling-shutter boxes and a bad mounting of the window. On the other hand, in the ventilation system design, <b>air-tightness</b> is generally neglected and included in the air change rate due to mechanical ventilation system. Such a practice increases energy consumptions and improves indoor air quality; on the contrary, a wrong assessment of the contribution of air infiltration can lead to the over-sizing of the ventilation system in the design phase. To better understand the influence of the windowed components on the air change rate under a pressure difference value of 50 Pa, the class of <b>air-tightness</b> should be assessed for each tested component, in compliance with EN 12207 Standard, and as a function of: (i) the type of material, (ii) the presence of the seal; (iii) the type of closure; (iv) the sealing of the door; (v) the maintenance condition. In this paper, the Authors present the first experimental results of <b>air-tightness</b> measurements carried out in three residential buildings in which windows retrofit consisted in sealing gasket on the wooden window and replacing them with PVC or aluminum windows. Moreover, the effectiveness of investigated windows retrofits has been estimated in terms of energy saving by using the fan pressurization method.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{energy-efficient}} and sustainable buildings requires {{the knowledge of}} all relevant parameters for the energetic quality of building envelopes. So far, {{there is no scientific}} background for the determination of the energetic quality of building envelopes made of steel sandwich panels and its influence on the energy demand for buildings available. In particular the numerical values of the parameters governing the energetic quality are not known. Therefore, the energetic quality, so far, cannot be assessed and optimized and its effect on the energy demand for a building cannot be determined. This work gives a systematic analysis of the thermal protection and <b>air-tightness</b> of buildings to obtain the necessary parameters and their qualities for an accurate rating of the energetic quality of buildings made of steel sandwich panels. For particular reference buildings with envelopes made of steel sandwich panels the consistency of directives, design standards, test standards and declarations of producers are checked and proposals are made for improving the situation for assessments. The work focuses on the design and structural detailing of steel sandwich products and their connections that govern the formation of thermal bridges and the <b>air-tightness.</b> This leads to recommendations for the structural design and execution of steel sandwich structures. The analysis has shown that an accurate determination of the effects of thermal bridges caused by metallic components in the building envelope requires the use of finite element methods. The determination of the <b>air-tightness</b> of joints between steel components in reproducible and economic way is only possible by experimental tests. A conclusion of the systematic analysis is that the relevant criteria for the assessment of the thermal protection and <b>air-tightness</b> of steel sandwich panels are the local requirements of <b>air-tightness</b> of a joint and the minimum requirements for thermal protection. Where these local and minimum requirements are met and the thickness of the sandwich panels is greater or equal to 120 mm, the building envelopes are practically free of thermal bridges and air-tight. The longitudinal joints of steel sandwich panels should be further developed {{in such a way that}} they are air-tight not only for full fit but for a certain variation of the gap in the joint. The variation should be limited by a vertical and horizontal tolerance of equal or more than 5 mm. The product standard for steel sandwich panels EN 14509 should be completely revised as far as “heat transfer” and “air-tightness” are concerned taking the results of this work into account. In future, light weight steel buildings should be all optimized in view of heat transfer and durable <b>air-tightness.</b> To this end, the products and joints should be further developed to reduce thermal bridges and to tolerate imperfections of fit of joints. The atlas for structural detailing to reduce thermal bridges for steel polyurethane sandwich panels as developed in this work should be extended to all structural solutions for light weight metal buildings. The procedure presented in this work and the results obtained for steel sandwich components permit to assess the energetic quality of building envelopes made of any other light-weight metal component. Therefore, this work may be considered as a basic contribution to energy efficient and sustainable construction of any building made of light weight metal components...|$|E

The aim of this thesis is to inform UK public policy on social housing retrofit, as to whether we are pursuing the correct goal by retrofitting with insulation and <b>air-tightness,</b> a strategy to conserve heat, rather than one that would also combat summertime overheating. The community of Rushenden was used as a case study to develop a specific adaptation strategy for retrofitted social housing in the South-East of England. Gaps in knowledge were identified relating to the role that insulation and <b>air-tightness</b> has in reducing or increasing the overheating risk, and the analysis of a wider range of shading strategies. The measures were discussed with sixteen households during completion of the adaptations questionnaire and three focus groups. Six households completed daily a longitudinal comfort questionnaire, over a period of two months. Monitoring of internal and external temperatures was carried out as part of IFORE but in addition questions about overheating were included by the author within the three IFORE questionnaires that were submitted to one hundred households during the timescale of the project. Two models were built in ESP-r, a European standard building simulation tool: a singlestorey and a two-storey house type. Dynamic thermal modelling, incorporating future weather files, was used to evaluate different specifications of insulation and <b>air-tightness</b> and the climate change adaptation measures. Future heating and cooling loads were calculated and the overheating risk was assessed using the adaptive comfort algorithm. The first results from the simulations showed that the light type of retrofit installed by IFORE will reduce both the heating load and the cooling load in 2030 s, 2050 s and 2080 s. On the other hand, a deeper type of retrofit that complies with the Passivhaus standard U-value for wall insulation, and <b>air-tightness,</b> will reduce the heating load but increase the cooling load. Despite reduction of overheating risk using the lighter type of retrofit, {{the living room of the}} single storey house will not meet the adaptive comfort set of criteria and should be classed as “overheating”. The installation of internal white, opaque roller blinds, will meet the adaptive comfort criteria and eliminate the need for cooling in both the single and two storey houses. The adaptation measures were discussed in terms of their practicality, affordability and the interaction between occupant and technology.

40|$|Great {{potential}} for the reduction of energy consumption in the Flemish houses {{can be found in}} retrofit cavity wall insulation. This is due to the reduced costs and the reduced complexity of the procedure in comparison to interior and exterior retrofit wall insulation and to the vast amount of non-insulated cavity-walls in Flemish houses. Nevertheless, retrofit cavity wall insulation isn’t as widely applied, controlled and promoted in Belgium as it is in countries such as Great-Britain by Ciga and the Netherlands by Venin. This is mainly caused by some bad experiences from the past and a lack of local, well documented exemplary projects, performance analysis and quality control framework. As an attempt to respond to these demands, a study on this technique was launched, putting together several Belgian research institutes. As a part of this study, 25 houses were analyzed as case-studies. This test-group was composed as a sample of the main products used for retrofitted cavity wall insulation in Belgium. Performance analysis was applied on several complementary levels and aspects such as thermal properties, <b>air-tightness,</b> indoor climate, thermal bridges and energy consumption. Therefore, the following measurements were used: heat flux-measurements and infrared thermography, blowerdoor-tests, measurements of indoor-climate and surface temperatures, record-keeping of heating consumption. When possible, measurements were performed before and after retrofitting the walls. These measurements were put against lab-measurements, theoretical analysis and computer-based simulations of theoretical energy-consumptions and 3 D-simulations of thermal bridges. The results showed good correlations between theory and practice, except for energy consumption if individual user-related factors are not thoroughly analyzed and taken into account. U-values of the walls were reduced by a factor 2 to 3. Although the changes in <b>air-tightness</b> were relatively small, reductions of the air infiltration were measured in every case-study, regardless of the used insulating material.

There were significant inconsistencies in the simulation results, especially for the annual and peak heating demand. Moreover, among the different calculation methods, the surface emissivity, the infiltration rate and the specification of the internal gains were found to cause significant variations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Under the {{environment}} of complex electromagnetic interference at the airport, high frequency weak signal produced by gas leakage of aircraft <b>air-tightness</b> system, can’t be accurately judged alone by testing instrument. For better developing useful signal discrimination, and improving testing effect of gas leakage signal, in the paper, wavelet threshold denoising algorithm and chaos system are applied. Through revising Donoho wavelet threshold denoising algorithm, defects of traditional denoising methods, like lower signal reconstruction precision, additive vibration and so on, are avoided. Signal to noise ratio of useful signal is further advanced. Through improving nonlinear recovery force item of Duffing oscillator equation, effective discrimination of high frequency weak signal is realized under the background of strong noise...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Gangway bellows in {{this study}} is the double {{wrinkled}} neoprene rubber component to accept various deviations between the carriage end parts of the articulated type high speed railway vehicle(HSRV). The fatigue failure of the bellows has a harmful effect on the riding comfort for the passengers with the increase of noise and ringing in the ears due to <b>air-tightness</b> failure during pass through a long tunnel. In this study, to assure the safety of gangway bellows of the HSRV, non-linear analysis of the gangway bellows considering triaxial angular displacement(rolling /yawing/pitching) between the carriage end parts are performed. The non-linear properties of the rubber are determined by uniaxial tension and equi-biaxial tension test. Moreover, from th...|$|E
