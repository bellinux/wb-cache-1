5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that <b>approximate</b> <b>the</b> real situation {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} <b>approximate</b> <b>the</b> function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, while it may be very large at a distant point.
