5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Using A-constants is {{practical}} when {{a decision}} on the implant power {{has to be made}} during surgery because the power of the lens varies in a 1:1 relationship with the A-constants: if A decreases by 1 diopter, IOL power decreases by 1 diopter also. This straight relationship adds to the simplicity and popularity of the A-constant. Other constants used in modern IOL formulas include the ACD value in Binkhorst and Hoffer-Q formulas, the a0, a1, and a2 constants of the Haigis formula, and the Surgeon factor (SF) in Holladay formulas. True <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> depth (ACD) is measured between the posterior corneal surface and the anterior lens surface.

25|$|In {{advanced}} cases, bulging of {{the cornea}} {{can result in}} a localized rupture of Descemet's membrane, an inner layer of the cornea. Aqueous humor from the eye's <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> seeps into the cornea before Descemet's membrane reseals.

25|$|In close/narrow-angle, the iridocorneal {{angle is}} {{completely}} closed because of forward {{displacement of the}} final roll and root of the iris against the cornea, resulting in {{the inability of the}} aqueous fluid to flow from the posterior to the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> and then out of the trabecular network. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and pain.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} symptoms of Norrie disease are ocular. The first visible finding is leukocoria, a grayish-yellow pupillary reflex that originates from {{a mass of}} unorganized tissue behind the lens. This material, which possibly includes an already detached retina, may be confused with a tumor and thus is termed pseudoglioma. However, an affected baby may have a normally sized eye globe and inconspicuous iris, <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber,</b> cornea and intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|Most IOL power {{formulas}} use the axial {{length and}} keratometric reading (K) {{to predict the}} position of the IOL postoperatively (ELP). In post-LASIK eyes this causes an error in this prediction because the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> dimensions do not really change in these eyes commensurately with the much flatter K. In order to address this problem the double-K method was developed, which uses the pre-LASIK corneal power for the calculation of the ELP, and the post-LASIK corneal power for the calculation of the Vergence component of the formula.|$|E
40|$|A 47 {{year old}} man with episodes of attacks of pain, redness and mild {{blurring}} of vision was investigated for narrow angle glaucoma in view of shallow <b>anterior</b> <b>chambers</b> and a cupped optic disc. The history was reviewed following a spontaneous attack in hospital, which had features other than acute glaucoma. A diagnosis of cluster headache was {{made on the basis}} of tests. Cluster headache has been defined as unilateral intense pain, involving the eye and head on one side, usually associated with flushing, nasal congestion and lacrimation; the attacks recurring one or more times daily and lasting 20 - 120 minutes. Such attacks commonly continue for weeks or months and are separated by an asymptomatic period of months to years. This episodic nature, together with unilaterality and tendency to occur at night, closely mimics narrow angle glaucoma. Further, if patients have shallow <b>anterior</b> <b>chambers</b> and disc cupping, the differentiation becomes more difficult yet critical. Resource to provocative tests is often the only answer as the following case report demonstrates...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma and {{cataracts}} {{are both}} diseases associated with aging and, as a result, {{it is not}} unusual to find both conditions coexisting in the same patient. In the past, however, combined surgery was not a popular procedure since the indi-vidual surgeries have conflicting endpoints, namely satisfactory wound closure in cataract surgery and the maintenance of a filtering wound in glaucoma surgery. Earlier surgical techniques such as full-thickness glaucoma surgery – in which flat <b>anterior</b> <b>chambers</b> were commonplace and also an indication of success – were fundamentally at odds with cataract surgery, where this situation was specifically avoided. Improvements in cataract surgery (including small incision phacoemulsifi-cation and intraocular lens [IOL] designs), the conversion to guarded filtration surgery (in which flat <b>anterior</b> <b>chambers</b> are uncommon), and the use of antimetabolites have all contributed to improved outcomes both in terms of vision and intraocular pressure (IOP). The evolution of cataract surgery, IOL design, and filtration surgery is such that combined surgery is now relatively commonplace.

25|$|All {{formulas}} {{require an}} {{estimation of the}} position that the IOL will sit in the eye, a factor known as the ELP, which is defined as the distance between the cornea and the IOL. ELP correlates with the placement of the IOL inside the eye, whether it is in the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> in the sulcus or in the capsular bag. It also varies with the implant’s configuration and the location of its optical center. For example, the use of a meniscus lens calls for a smaller ELP value than a biconvex IOL.|$|E
25|$|As {{the disease}} progresses, severe nonproliferative {{diabetic}} retinopathy enters an advanced or proliferative (PDR) stage, where blood vessels proliferate/grow. The {{lack of oxygen}} in the retina causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills {{the inside of the}} eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the angle of the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} A-scan {{ultrasound}} biometry {{are currently in}} use. The first is contact applanation biometry. This technique requires placing an ultrasound probe on the central cornea. While this is a convenient way to determine the axial length for most normal eyes, errors in measurement almost invariably result from the probe indenting the cornea and shallowing the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber.</b> Since the compression error is variable, it cannot be compensated for by a constant. IOL power calculations using these measurements will lead to an overestimation of the IOL power. In shorter eyes, this effect is amplified. The second type is immersion A-scan biometry, which requires placing a saline filled scleral shell between the probe and the eye. Since the probe does not exert direct pressure on the cornea, compression of the <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> is avoided. A mean shortening of 0.25–0.33mm has been reported between applanation and immersion axial length measurements, which can translate into an error of IOL power by approximately 1 D. In general, immersion biometry {{has been shown to}} be more accurate than contact applanation biometry in several studies. The main limitation with the A-scan ultrasound is the poor image resolution due to the use of a relatively long, low-resolution wavelength (10MHz) to measure a relatively short distance. In addition, variations in retinal thickness surrounding the fovea contribute to inconsistency in the final measurement.|$|E

25|$|The main {{structures}} of the bird eye {{are similar to those}} of other vertebrates. The outer layer of the eye consists of the transparent cornea at the front, and two layers of sclera — a tough white collagen fibre layer which surrounds the rest of the eye and supports and protects the eye as a whole. The eye is divided internally by the lens into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour, and the posterior chamber contains the vitreous humour, a clear jelly-like substance.|$|E
25|$|Screening for {{glaucoma}} {{is usually}} performed {{as part of}} a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma should include measurements of the intraocular pressure via tonometry, <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber</b> angle examination or gonioscopy, and examination of the optic nerve to look for any visible damage to it, or change in the cup-to-disc ratio and also rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test should be performed.

Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 85% of affected males. Clinical diagnoses rely on ocular findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8–10 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris atrophy, shallowing of <b>anterior</b> <b>chamber,</b> and shrinking of the globe. By this point, people with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.|$|E
