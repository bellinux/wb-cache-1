5|$|After his tour, Dylan {{returned}} to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> a TV show. His publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula. Manager Albert Grossman had scheduled a concert tour {{for the latter}} part of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's <b>advance.</b> <b>For</b> Dutthagamani's forces, the capture of the city would mean that they could easily move on to Anuradhapura.|$|E

5|$|Bakker {{received}} a large <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> the novel from Bantam Books, {{rumored to be}} in the six-figure range. The book was prominently featured at the American Booksellers' Convention in Chicago, alongside Michael Crichton's The Lost World. Coverage of the event noted that both novels were on the trailing end of the dinosaur fad fueled by Jurassic Park, as the new trend in American books was shifting toward politics {{in the aftermath of the}} 1994 US elections.|$|E
5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would no longer be a deterrent.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Kesselring {{served with}} his {{regiment}} in Lorraine {{until the end}} of 1914, when he was transferred to the 1st Bavarian Foot Artillery, which formed part of the Sixth Army. On 19 May 1916, he was promoted to Hauptmann (captain). In 1916 he was transferred again, to the 3rd Bavarian Foot Artillery. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Arras, using his tactical acumen to halt a British <b>advance.</b> <b>For</b> his services on the Western Front, he was decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{finished}} writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent £10million to {{keep the}} book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel {{to be released in}} <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> press review, although two reviews were submitted early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it.|$|E
5|$|Shooting long {{scenes in}} a zero-g {{environment}} was a challenge. Eventually, the team {{decided to use}} computer-generated imagery for the spacewalk scenes and automotive robots to move Bullock's character for interior space station scenes. This meant that shots and blocking had to be planned well in <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> the robots to be programmed. It also made the production period much longer than expected. When the script was finalized, Cuarón assumed it would take about a year to complete the film, but it took {{four and a half}} years.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the company}} {{came under heavy fire}} {{from an old}} quarry {{occupied}} by over one hundred German soldiers who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained as they began to <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six German soldiers and capturing a machine gun. The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Square {{released}} Final Fantasy Tactics <b>Advance</b> <b>for</b> the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2003. The game {{setting and}} engine {{are similar to}} the ones of its predecessor, however the characters and plot are notably different; the cast of characters is considerably smaller, and the plot is considerably simpler. Additionally, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance has a shorter main campaign, but more side missions and a secret campaign {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes to assess the line of <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They were connected to Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they knew to be written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} of food supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction of food levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{prisoners of}} war {{captured}} by the US troops during the battle reported that the NK 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24–25. This brought {{it down to a}} strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the North Korean <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> several days, giving the UN forces valuable time to set up the Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit {{by the time it was}} placed on Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard Law Review {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August 2009, U Car Share started {{providing}} carsharing {{services with}} public {{pick up and}} drop off stops at several different TRAX stations {{as well as the}} University of Utah campus. Three secured bicycle lockers are also located on the facility, but must be rented from UTA in <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> an annual fee. Three ticket machines are located on the platform that provide single-ride, round trip, and all day passes, as well as family and discounted fare tickets. The ticket machines are cash-only and provide change in dollar coins and quarters only. TRAX ticket machines used to accept UTA fare tokens, which are still accepted on buses. On 1 September 2008 UTA discontinued the use of tokens at TRAX machines due to increased fraud.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} <b>advance.</b> <b>For</b> example, the introductory airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built {{in the four years}} preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E
5|$|The final {{budget of}} Krrish came to , {{which at the}} time was {{considered}} big-budget film by Bollywood standards. The film was released on 23 June 2006 with 1,000 prints, and in five languages simultaneously. It was the first Indian film to receive payments in <b>advance</b> <b>for</b> product placement, music, and international distribution rights. There was also related merchandise offered for sale prior to the film's release to maximize profits. These included action figures, masks and other toys. The film's DVD was released in Region 1 on 18 August 2006, by Adlabs. On 21 August 2006, it was released for all regions by Filmkraft. Adlabs also released a Blu-ray version. After the success of Krrish, Rakesh Roshan announced that he would be making a sequel, tentatively titled Krrish 3. He confirmed that Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra would reprise their roles, and that the main antagonist would be played by Vivek Oberoi.|$|E
