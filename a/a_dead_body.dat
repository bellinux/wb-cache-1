5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead. Within his classification of demons, he explained the concept through the notion that incubi and succubae could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body,</b> it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, four 12-year-old boys — Petey LaChance (Peter, with Richard Dreyfuss's voice in his head narrating the story), Quag Chambers (Quagmire), Joey Duchamp (Joe with Roy Scheider's voice in his head, who starts talking with Dreyfuss until Joe stops them), and Cleve Brown (Cleveland) — {{set out to find}} <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> in the woods, {{following}} a set of railroad tracks to find it. At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a train, which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him. The others end up going {{all the way back to}} Pressman's junkyard to get him a wheelchair.|$|E
500|$|When {{they were}} asked for a promotional image for use at Image Expo, Brubaker {{suggested}} [...] "a typewriter and some blood and <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body's</b> hands".

5000|$|For {{stricken}} climbers above 8000 m some experienced climbers {{have said}} that if you cannot walk at such a high altitude, you might as well be on the moon in terms of a possible successful rescue. That is why the area above 8000 m {{is referred to as the}} [...] "death zone". Even attempting to move <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> climber's <b>body</b> takes significant effort, and the recovery of <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> climber's <b>body</b> at high altitude is a monumental effort at a very slow pace. The recovery sometimes must be abandoned, and risks the lives of those attempting the recovery since these attempts have resulted in additional deaths while just attempting to move <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> climber's <b>body.</b> That is why <b>bodies</b> of <b>dead</b> climbers high on Everest are left where they died or just moved off the main climbing routes.|$|R
5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body,</b> that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E
5|$|In Charleston, South Carolina, the {{hurricane}} washed aground several ships and uprooted numerous trees, though {{damage to the}} city harbor was minimal. The lighthouse on North Island flanking Winyah Bay collapsed under high winds, and in Georgetown proper, {{the hurricane}} {{was considered to be}} the worst since the 1804 Antigua–Charleston hurricane, despite its storm surge being of a lesser size. A cotton field covering 94acres was ruined nearby. At Smithville, North Carolina, numerous ships experienced damage, while considerable destruction to structures was observed, with many wharves wrecked. Meanwhile, at Wilmington, the hurricane inflicted widespread damage, with many wharves severely damaged, and significant losses sustained by salt, sugar, rice, and lumber industries. The gable sections of three masonry houses were destroyed by wind or water, and wooden houses suffered especially badly, with many obliterated and those under construction flattened. One individual died after a wall collapsed and several slaves were killed, one by drowning, at local plantations. At Bald Head Island, the United States Revenue Cutter Service vessel Governor Williams was stripped of its foremast and subsequently ran ashore before being repaired and continuing on its journey. A second boat owned by the agency, the Diligence, was tethered at port in Wilmington and endured no damage; similarly, little impact occurred at New Bern. Throughout the storm, several vessels and supplies of stranded sailors were driven aground along the North Carolinan coast. On the Bogue Banks, the remains of the Adolphus and Atlantic were discovered, and at the Core Banks, <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> was washed ashore, partially eaten by fish.|$|E

25|$|If {{a person}} with Ebola disease dies, {{direct contact with the}} body should be avoided. Certain burial rituals, which may have {{included}} making various direct contacts with <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> <b>body,</b> require reformulation such that they consistently maintain a proper protective barrier between the dead body and the living. Social anthropologists may help find alternatives to traditional rules for burials.|$|E

25|$|The {{indigenous}} population of New Zealand also have strong views regarding organ donation.
