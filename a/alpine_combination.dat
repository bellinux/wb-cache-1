30|$|This {{decision-making}} process {{needs to be}} inverted. Subjects who operate in peri-urban areas should {{be put in the}} condition to decide, and a dialogue with the city to be established in order to maximize shared interests, the most important of which is keeping specific urban traits within a processes of sustainable development. This is made possible by a rooted tradition of self-government that is typical of the <b>Alpine</b> region, in <b>combination</b> with the special attention such regions devote to as scarce a resource as usable soil. As a result, the administrations of the towns adjacent to the city, although small, enjoy a certain degree of autonomy, or an authority that extends its jurisdiction on the city {{as well as on the}} surrounding territory may intervene in the management of territorial processes. The first scenario applies to the peri-urban areas around Trento, governed by administrations such as the Comunità di Valle (Valley Communities), while an example of the second instance would be the city of Bolzano, where agricultural terrains extending beyond the city lie under the protection of the Provincial government. In other cases, such as Grenoble, local actors (in this case farmers) replace an autonomous form of government in negotiating important territorial decisions with the city.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the bone development of two mountain sheep breeds during natural summer grazing either in the lowlands or on different characteristic alpine pastures. Pasture types differed in topographic slope, plant species composition, general nutritional feeding value, Ca and P content, and Ca:P ratio of herbage. Twenty-seven Engadine sheep (ES) lambs and 27 Valaisian Black Nose sheep (VS) lambs were divided into four groups of 6 to 7 animals per breed and allocated to three contrasting alpine pasture types and one lowland pasture type. The lambs were slaughtered after 9 wk of experimental grazing. The steep <b>alpine</b> pastures in <b>combination</b> with a high (4. 8) to very high (13. 6) Ca:P ratio in the forage decreased total bone mineral content as measured {{in the middle of}} the left metatarsus of the lambs from both breeds, and cortical bone mineral content and cortical bone mineral density of ES lambs. Breed × pasture type interactions occurred in the development of total and cortical bone mineral content, and in cortical thickness, indicating that bone metabolism of different genotypes obviously profited differently from the varying conditions. An altitude effect occurred for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D with notably higher serum concentrations on the three alpine sites, and a breed effect led to higher concentrations for ES than VS. Despite a high variance, there were pasture-type effects on serum markers of bone formation and resorption...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} a {{theoretical}} contribution on the ongoing debate on cross-border regions, regional identity and local networks. It shows how the Alps are being institutionalized and how a pan-Alpine regional identity is built across national boundaries. The aim is {{to show how the}} Alpine actors (NGOs, Alpine leaders and scientists, Alpine population, etc.) contribute to what Paasi calls “the institutionalization of regions”. The paper proposes an application of existing theories on identity and regional identity to the <b>Alpine</b> case. The <b>combination</b> of the different theories enables one to better identify the actors involved in the building of the Alps and other European cross-border regions. The proposition of Paasi will be combined with the contribution of Avanza and Laferté on identity, which differentiate the concepts of identification, social image and belonging. The analysis and comprehension of regional institutionalization is advanced if it is broken up into the three components of identity distinguished by Avanza and Laferté. In that way, the role of each component can be underscored and regional actors easily identified. This distinction is particularly interesting in order to capture the processes of region building and multi-level governance currently going on in the Alps. An integrated framework combining the different concepts is proposed. Finally, the paper will show how the Alpine region is part of a more generalised process of renewed regional governance, where European cross-border regions play a central role promoting them as “pivotal spaces of integration” (Sidaway 2009 : 749). Furthermore, a final critical point about the participation of the population in this process will be addressed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The geochemical {{properties}} of the South-Eastern Alps volcanics (SEAV, Eocene age) call for a within-plate origin of the most primitive basalts, {{in contrast to the}} widespread calc-alkaline magmatism which developed some million years later northwestwards along the Periadriatic Lineament. The two contrasting magmatic suites that coexist in the Alpine area deﬁne binary mixing relationships in the Sr–Nd and Sr–Pb isotopic space, the end members of which being a crustal component (e. g. lower continental crust) and a HIMU-DMM component (e. g. the SEAV). The occurrence of a HIMU (high μ= high 238 U/ 204 Pb) component, which normally traces mantle plumes of deep mantle origin, in a tectonic regime dominated by collision tectonics (the tertiary convergence of European and Adriatic plates) can be explained by slab detachment and ensuing upwelling of mantle material through the lithospheric gap. We combine geochemical data and geophysical modelling to unravel the evolution of the Alpine slab after interaction with plume material and the genesis of the <b>Alpine</b> magmatism. The <b>combination</b> of changes in negative buoyancy caused by continental subduction and softening of a part of the slab caused by slab–plume interaction may act as a regulator for the time of slab breakoff and, consequently, for the variations of magmatism in the overriding lithosphere above a subduction zone. The thermal evolution of a subducting slab is modiﬁed by contact with the plume material which decreases signiﬁcantly the total strength of the slab and favours slab detachment. Interactions between the HIMU component and the shallower depleted mantle can account for the geochemical characteristics of the SEAV. Counterﬂows of plume material towards the top of the subducting slab may also increase heating and partial melting of the overriding mantle wedge, giving rise to the calc-alkaline suite outcropping in the proximity of the Periadriatic Lineament. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This 2 -day trip will {{highlight}} recent {{fire and}} storm-related debris flows in the Payette River region, Holocene records of fires and fire-related sedimentation events preserved in alluvial fan stratigraphic sequences, and geomorphology and geology of alpine glaciations in the spectacular Sawtooth Mountains and Stanley Basin of central Idaho. Storm events and associated scour following recent {{fires in the}} South Fork Payette basin have exposed Holocene fire-related debris-flow deposits, flood sediments, and other alluvial fan-building deposits that yield insights into Holocene environmental change. Moraine characteristics and sediment cores from the southeastern Sawtooth Mountains and Stanley Basin provide evidence of late Pleistocene <b>alpine</b> glaciation. A <b>combination</b> of these glacial records with reconstructions of regional equilibrium line elevations produces late-glacial paleoclimatic inferences for the area. Day one of the trip will examine recent and Holocene fire-related deposits along the South Fork Payette River; day two will focus on alpine glaciation in the Sawtooth Mountains (fig. 1). A description of the scope, methods, results and interpretation of the South Fork Payette fire study is given below. Background information on late Pleistocene alpine glaciation in the eastern Sawtooth Mountains is presented with the material for day 2 of the trip. The road log for day 1 of the trip begins at Banks, Idaho, and ends in Stanley, Idaho. Stop locations are shown on figure 2. At Stop 1, we will provide an introduction to interpretation of alluvial fan stratigraphic sections, and discuss the Boise Ridge fault. At Stops 2 – 4 (Hopkins Creek, Deadwood River, and Jughead creek), we will examine recent debrisflow deposits and Holocene alluvial fan stratigraphic sections. At Stop 5 (Helende Campground), {{we will look at}} a series of well-preserved Holocene and Pleistocene terraces and at Stop 6 (Canyon Creek), we will briefly inspect fire-related deposits in higher-elevation alluvial fan stratigraphic sections. The road log for day 2 begins at Stanley, Idaho, and ends in Sun Valley, Idaho. Stop locations are shown on figure 2. Stop 1, at Redfish Lake, will focus on regional equilibrium line altitude reconstructions and on the general pattern of late Pleistocene glaciation on the eastern flank of the Sawtooth Mountains. Stop 2 will be at Pettit Lake, where we will examine the moraine sequence and discuss relative weathering criteria and moraine groupings. At Stop 3, near Alturas Lake, we will discuss lake sediment coring, moraine chronology, and implications for latest Pleistocene paleoclimatic inferences. Stop 4 will be a brief stop at Galena Summit for an overview of the Sawtooth Mountains and a discussion of ice accumulation patterns. The trip will end at a set of moraines in the Trail Creek valley, near Sun Valley, where we will examine moraine morphology and weathering rind data that constrain the moraine ages...|$|R
