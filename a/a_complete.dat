5000|$|SR 9 was {{established}} {{at least as}} early as 1919 along its current route. In 1921, it was extended to Blairsville, concurrent with SR 11. By the end of 1926, it had a [...] "completed hard surface" [...] from Atlanta to {{the northern part of}} Sandy Springs, a [...] "sand clay or top soil" [...] surface from the northern part of Sandy Springs to just southwest of Dahlonega, a [...] "completed semi-hard surface" [...] from just southwest of Dahlonega to that city. The extension to Blairsville was decommissioned. By the end of 1930, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from just southwest of Dahlonega to that city. By 1932, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from the northern part of Sandy Springs to the Forsyth-Dawson county line, a sand clay or top soil surface from the county line to just southwest of Dahlonega, and a [...] "completed grading, no surface course" [...] from just northeast of Dahlonega to its northern terminus. At this time, US 19 was designated along the entire length of SR 9. The next month, the highway had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from the Forsyth-Dawson county line to just north of it and from just northeast of Dahlonega to its northern terminus. In September of that year, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from just north of the Forsyth-Dawson county line to Dawsonville and a sand clay or top soil surface from Dawsonville to just southwest of Dahlonega. The next month, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from Dawsonville to about halfway between there and Dahlonega. In November, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from about halfway between Dawsonville and Dahlonega to just southwest of Dahlonega. By the middle of 1933, SR 9 was under construction from the northern part of Sandy Springs to the Fulton-Forsyth county line. By the end of the year, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from the northern part of Sandy Springs to the Fulton-Forsyth county line. A few months later, it was under construction from the Fulton-Forsyth county line to Cumming and from Dawsonville to just southwest of Dahlonega. Near the end of that year, it was indicated to be [...] "completed grading, not surfaced" [...] from the Fulton-Forsyth county line to Cumming, <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from Cumming to just south of the Forsyth-Dawson county line, <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from just south of the Forsyth-Dawson county line to Dawsonville, <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from Dawsonville to just northeast of that city, and under construction from just northeast of Dawsonville to just southwest of Dahlonega. Just before 1935, the highway had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface form Dawsonville to just northeast of Dahlonega and <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> semi-hard surface from just northeast of Dahlonega to its northern terminus. A few months later, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from just south of the Forsyth-Dawson county line to that county line. By July of that year, it was under construction from the Forsyth-Dawson county line to Dawsonville. One year later, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from the Forsyth-Dawson county line to Dawsonville. A few months later, SR 9 was under construction from just northeast of Dahlonega to a point about halfway between that city and its northern terminus. Another year later, and the highway had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from just northeast of Dahlonega to just northeast of the halfway point between Dahlonega and its northern terminus. By the end of the year, it was indicated to be completed, but not surfaced from just northeast of the halfway point between Dahlonega and its northern terminus to its northern terminus. Later that year, it had <b>a</b> <b>completed</b> hard surface from just northeast of the halfway point between Dahlonega and its northern terminus to its northern terminus.|$|R

In his next start on May 23, he threw <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> game, {{allowing}} just one run as San Francisco defeated the Seattle Mariners 51.

Duke replaced Cain on the NL All-Star team. Cain threw <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> game on August 3 against Houston; however, he suffered the loss for the first time in his career when throwing <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> game, allowing four runs in a 43 defeat.
