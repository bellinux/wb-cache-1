5000|$|In {{addition}} to filing Form I-765 with the USCIS, Form I-539 (to extend or change nonimmigrant status) {{must also be}} filed, and the <b>associated</b> <b>fee</b> for it ($290) must be paid {{over and above the}} $380 filing fee for Form I-765.

Other techniques include a new dispute resolution process, daily market reports and exchanges and the public exchange of collateral between parties.|$|E
