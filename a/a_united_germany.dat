However Maximilian II stood alongside Bavaria's ally, the Austrian Empire, in opposition to Austria's enemy, the Kingdom of Prussia, which was to receive the imperial crown of <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany.</b> This opposition was resented by many Bavarian citizens, who wanted <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany,</b> but in the end Prussia declined accepting the crown and the constitution of a German state they perceived to be too liberal and not in Prussia's interests.|$|E
25|$|Overcoming Soviet {{objections}} to a united Germany's membership in NATO was of key importance. This was accomplished in July when the alliance, led by President George H.W. Bush, issued the London Declaration on a transformed NATO. On 16 July, President Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl announced the {{agreement in principle}} on <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> in NATO. This {{cleared the way for}} the signing in Moscow, on 12 September, of the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany—in effect the peace treaty that was anticipated at the end of World War II. In addition to terminating Four Power rights, the treaty mandated the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Germany by the end of 1994, made clear that the current borders (especially the Oder-Neisse line) were viewed as final and definitive, and specified the right of <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> to belong to NATO. It also provided for the continued presence of British, French, and American troops in Berlin during the interim period of the Soviet withdrawal. In the treaty, the Germans renounced nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and stated their intention to reduce the (combined) German armed forces to 370,000 within 3 to 4 years after the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, signed in Paris on 19 November 1990, entered into force.|$|E
25|$|The various {{different}} {{possibilities for}} <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> were: a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria {{or just the}} German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria {{was not willing to}} relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.|$|E

25|$|Salomon {{realised}} {{that his}} nephew had no talent for trade {{and it was}} decided that Heine should enter the law. So, in 1819, Heine went to the University of Bonn (then in Prussia). Political life in Germany was divided between conservatives and liberals. The conservatives, who were in power, wanted to restore things to the way they were before the French Revolution. They were against German unification because they felt <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> might fall victim to revolutionary ideas. Most German states were absolutist monarchies with a censored press. The opponents of the conservatives, the liberals, wanted to replace absolutism with representative, constitutional government, equality before the law and a free press. At the University of Bonn, liberal students were at war with the conservative authorities. Heine was a radical liberal {{and one of the first}} things he did after his arrival was to take part in a parade which violated the Carlsbad Decrees, a series of measures introduced by Metternich to suppress liberal political activity.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Grimm's work tied in {{strongly}} to {{his views on}} Germany and its culture. His work with fairy tales and his philological work dealt with German origins. He loved his people and wished for <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany,</b> {{he and his brother}} were vocal proponents of expansionist Pan-Germanism. In the German revolution of 1848, he was given a chance to make these views known when {{he was elected to the}} Frankfurt National Parliament. The people of Germany had demanded a constitution, so the Parliament, formed of elected members from various German states, met to form one. Grimm was selected for the office in a large part because of his part in the University of Goettingen's refusal to swear to the king of Hanover expounded upon above. He then went to Frankfurt, where he did not play a big part, but did make some speeches, which tended to stray into the realms of history and philology rather than whatever political question was at hand. Grimm was adamant on one subject, however; he wanted the Danish-ruled but German-speaking duchy of Holstein to be under German control. He talked passionately on this subject, which showed his fierce German nationalism.|$|E

They wished to ensure, however, that Germany would stay within NATO. In December 1989, the administration of President George H. W. Bush made <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany's</b> continued NATO membership a requirement for supporting reunification. Kohl agreed, although less than 20% of West Germans supported remaining within NATO; he also wished to avoid a neutral Germany, as he believed that would destroy NATO, cause the United States and Canada to leave Europe, and cause Britain and France to form an anti-German alliance. The United States increased its support of Kohl's policies, as it feared that otherwise Oskar Lafontaine, a critic of NATO, might become Chancellor.|$|R

She expressed concern that <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.

This aim was epitomized by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's quote: [...] "I knew that a Franco-Prussian War must take place before <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> was formed."

2500|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989, and {{the reunification}} of East and West Germany, was {{followed}} by intense public debate around the articulations of national identity and citizenship, including the place of Germany’s Turkish minority {{in the future of}} <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany.</b> These debates about citizenship were accompanied by expressions of xenophobia and ethnic violence that targeted the Turkish population. Anti-immigrant sentiment was especially strong in the former eastern states of Germany, which underwent profound social and economic transformations during the reunification process. Turkish communities experienced considerable fear for their safety throughout Germany, with some 1,500 reported cases of right wing violence, and 2,200 cases the year after. The political rhetoric calling for foreigner-free zones (Ausländer-freie Zonen) and the rise of neo-Nazi groups sharpened public awareness of integration issues and generated intensified support among liberal Germans for the competing idea of Germany as a [...] "multicultural" [...] society. Citizenship laws that established eligibility according to place of birth rather than according to descent have been slow in coming and restrictions on dual citizenship are still onerous. However, increasing numbers of second-generation Turks have opted for German citizenship and are becoming more involved in the political process.|$|E
2500|$|The reunification {{was opposed}} in several {{quarters}} {{both inside and}} outside Germany, including Margaret Thatcher, Jürgen Habermas, and Günter Grass, out of fear of that <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>Germany</b> might resume its aggression toward other countries. Just prior to reunification West Germany had gone through a national debate, called Historikerstreit, over how to regard its Nazi past, with one side claiming that there was nothing specifically German about Nazism, and that the German people should let go its shame over the past and look forward, proud of its national identity, and others holding that Nazism grew out of German identity and the nation needed to remain responsible for its past and guard carefully against any recrudescence of Nazism. [...] This debate did not give comfort to those concerned about whether a reunited Germany might be a danger to other countries, nor did the rise of skinhead neo-nazi groups in the former East Germany, as exemplified by riots in Hoyerswerda in 1991. [...] An identity-based nationalist backlash arose after unification as people reached backward to answer [...] "the German question", leading to violence by four Neo-Nazi/far-right parties which were all banned by Germany's Federal Constitutional Court after committing or inciting violence: the Nationalist Front, National Offensive, German Alternative, and the Kamaradenbund.|$|E
