5|$|Carbenes that {{formally}} {{derive from}} imidazole-2-ylidenes by substitution of sulfur, oxygen, or other chalcogens for both α-nitrogens {{are expected to}} be unstable, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the potential to dissociate into an alkyne (R1C≡CR2) and a carbon dichalcogenide (X1=C=X2).|$|E
60|$|And {{the hostess}} smiles equally graciously to all: she is ready {{with a bright}} word of welcome for {{everybody}} now, just as she will be anon with a mute look of farewell, when--at ten o'clock--by Wellington's commands, one by one, one officer after another will slip out of this hospitable house, out into the rainy night, for a hurried visit to lodgings or barracks to collect a few necessaries, and then to work--to horse or march--to form {{into the ranks of}} battle <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> formed for the quadrille--squares to face the enemy--advance, deploy <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> done in the mazes of the dance! to fight <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> danced! to give their life <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> given a kiss.|$|R

5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been forced}} into the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable. The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes is a record.|$|E
5|$|Horseshoe crabs, {{which are}} aquatic, use {{external}} fertilization, {{in other words}} the sperm and ova meet outside the parents' bodies. Their trilobite-like larvae look rather like miniature adults <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> full sets of appendages and eyes, but initially they have only two pairs of book-gills and gain three more pairs as they molt.|$|E

5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, {{they spread}} their pincers {{and in some}} cases raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with the sting ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{is believed}} to have been housed in Caesarea in the 6th century, together with the Codex Sinaiticus, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the same unique divisions of chapters in the Acts.

5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
5|$|Amy awakens to {{find herself}} {{strapped}} to an examining table, near to where Ambrose's husband Mo is also ensnared. Mo explains that the Silurians intended to vivisect her, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> vivisected him— awake. The Doctor and Nasreen arrive underground in the TARDIS; the Doctor explains about the Silurians and says that he expects to encounter {{only a few of}} the creatures. The show ends on a cliffhanger as the Doctor and Nasreen behold an immense Silurian civilisation in the caverns below the earth.|$|E
5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm for as long <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E

They are also Germany's most successful team in international competitions, having won eleven trophies. Bayern {{is one of only}} five clubs to have won all three major European competitions and also the last club to have won the European Cup three times in a row, entitling them to wear a multiple-winner badge during Champions League matches.|$|E
5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, but {{is still}} home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during the Christmas season when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance of Bethlehem.|$|E
5|$|Both {{hunting and}} egging {{continue}} today, although {{not at the}} levels {{that occurred in the}} past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the Māori of Stewart Island/Rakiura continue to harvest the chicks of the sooty shearwater <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done for centuries, using traditional methods (called kaitiakitanga) to manage the harvest, but now work with the University of Otago in studying the populations. In Greenland, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.|$|E

5|$|Djungarian hamsters {{are common}} as pets in Europe and North America, and exhibit greater {{variance}} in their coats than {{those found in}} the wild. They reproduce often—more so than Syrian hamsters, and <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no fixed breeding season, can continue to produce large numbers of offspring all year round. Young pups act aggressively to one another, while breeding females may show similar aggression to males.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are easily}} {{distinguished}} from males <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour {{is not very}} {{different from that of the}} male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E
