40|$|This report {{develops}} {{and presents}} estimates {{for a set}} of three values that represent a reasonable range for the packaging factors for several waste streams that are potential greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste. The packaging factor is defined as the volume of a greater-than-Class C low-level waste disposal container divided by the original, as-generated or ``unpackaged,`` volume of the wastes loaded into the disposal container. Packaging factors take into account any processes that reduce or increase an original unpackaged volume of a greater-than-Class C low-level radioactive waste, the volume inside a waste container not occupied by the waste, and the volume of the waste container itself. The three values developed represent (a) the base case or most likely value for a packaging factor, (b) a high case packaging factor that corresponds to the largest anticipated volume of waste for disposal, and (c) a low case packaging factor for the smallest volume expected. Three categories of greater-than-Class C low-level waste are evaluated in this report: activated metals, sealed sources, and <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>wastes.</b> Estimates of reasonable packaging factors for the low, base, and high cases for the specific waste streams in each category are shown in Table H- 1...|$|E

Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other facilities that they own or operate. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local authorities administer these regulations.|$|R

50|$|Mohave was {{the only}} power plant in the United States that used coal {{delivered}} by coal-slurry pipeline. The 18 in diameter Black Mesa Pipeline ran 275 mi to the plant from the Peabody Energy Black Mesa Mine in Kayenta, AZ, and could deliver 660 ST per hour. The land where the mine is located {{is owned by the}} Navajo and Hopi tribes. Four 8-million-gallon storage tanks each held the equivalent of 20000 ST of dry coal. The slurry transport water was recycled for cooling tower water makeup; this and <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> water was reused, making Mohave a zero-discharge facility. A natural-gas line run to the facility from a gas main near Topock, Arizona supplied the required heat to start the plant, although the line was too small to run the plant exclusively on gas. The power was transmitted via two 500kV lines to substations in southern Nevada and southern California.|$|R
40|$|Electronic waste (e-Waste) {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing areas of the {{international}} waste stream increasing at a much higher rate than <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> streams. Fast growing electronics industry due to rising demand of information and communication technology around the world coupled with rapid product obsolescence and lack of end-of-life management options have all led to the un-sustainable management of the waste stream. Computers made from over 1, 000 materials, many of them are toxic, contribute significantly to the e-Waste stream which is estimated to be around 20 - 50 million tonnes annually. Design for environment, cleaner production, extended producer responsibility, standards and labelling, product stewardship, recycling and remanufacturing are some of practices adopted by various countries around the world to deal with the e-Waste stream. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of these practices and to investigate how they contribute to the sustainable management of e-Waste.

This paper will describe the conceptual design of the waste recycling system developed to satisfy the requirements of this initial 12 person settlement. The Waste Recycling System (WRS) consists of two major components:- An Ecological Processing Unit (EPU) that combines biological with various physiochemical systems to process gray water and,- A Composting System (CS) designed to process feces, food waste, inedible/unusable plant material, paper, biodegradable plastics, and material collected from agricultural and aquaculture filtration systems. <b>All</b> <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> products, including industrial process, medical, and laboratory waste are handled by other means.

40|$|Managing {{solid waste}} {{is one of}} the biggest {{challenges}} in urban areas around the world. Technologically advanced economies generate vast amounts of organic waste materials, many of which are disposed to landfills. In the future, efficient use of carbon containing <b>waste</b> and <b>all</b> <b>other</b> <b>waste</b> materials has to be increased to reduce the need for virgin raw materials acquisition, including biomass, and reduce carbon being emitted to the atmosphere therefore mitigating climate change. At end-of-life, carbon-containing waste should not only be treated for energy recovery (e. g. via incineration) but technologies should be applied to recycle the carbon for use as material feedstocks. Thermochemical and biochemical conversion technologies offer the option to utilize organic waste for the production of chemical feedstock and subsequent polymers. The routes towards synthetic materials allow a more closed cycle of materials and can help to reduce dependence on either fossil or biobased raw materials. This chapter summarizes carbon-recycling routes available and investigates how in the long-term they could be applied to enhance waste management in both industrial countries as well as developing and emerging economies. We conclude with a case study looking at the system-wide global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) of producing high-density polyethylene (HDPE) from organic waste feedstock via gasification followed by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). Results of the analysis indicate that the use of organic waste feedstock is beneficial if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with landfill diversion are considered...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Republic of Germany {{intends to}} dispose {{of all types of}} {{radioactive}} waste in deep geological formations. This approach comprises spent fuel elements, vitrified fission product solution, nuclear power plant operational and decommissioning waste as well as spent sealed radiation sources and miscellaneous waste originating from small waste generators. The Atomic Energy Act gives the responsibility for the disposal of radioactive waste to the Federal Government with the Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz (BfS- Federal Office for Radiation Protection) as the legally responsible authority. <b>All</b> <b>other</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> management procedures, i. e. spent fuel storage, reprocessing, conditioning, transportation and interim storage are within the responsibility of the waste generators. The federal states must construct and operate regional collecting depots for the interim storage of radioactive waste originating, in particular, from radioisotope application in industry, universities and medicine. As a result of the September 1998 federal elections, a coalition government of the Social Democrats and Alliance ´ 90 /The Greens was formed. The new Federal Government makes a pronounced change in energy policy, the most important feature of which is the abandoning or phasing out of nuclear energy. It is intended to irreversibly phase out nuclear energy use for electricity generation.

40|$|Early in FY 04, the Advanced Nuclear Transformation Technology (ANTT) {{subcommittee}} of the Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee (NERAC) requested a report on repository benefits for recycling of key transuranics in existing light water-cooled reactors (LWRs). The ANTT reviewers specifically requested a quantification of how such a campaign would impact (improve) the achievable loading of nuclear waste in the Yucca Mountain facility. The request stipulated that the transuranics be separated from commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) and recycled {{a finite number of}} times in LWR-compatible fuel forms. The spent fuel remaining {{at the end of the}} recycling campaign, as well as <b>all</b> <b>other</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> generated by spent fuel reprocessing, would be permanently disposed in a geologic repository. In response, two reports have been prepared and distributed as deliverables for the AFCI program. Reference 1 provides the final report which addresses the original ANTT sub-committee request. Plutonium, neptunium, and americium recycling strategies in assemblies fabricated from mixed-oxide (MOX), CORAIL (heterogeneous UO{sub 2 } and MOX), and inert-matrix fuel (IMF) forms were evaluated; the focus of the report is the time-dependent thermal response of the repository to a given loading of nuclear waste in the storage tunnels (drifts), as well as a quantification of how the loading could be increased relative to the reference direct disposal of CSNF. Reference 2 provides a more complete description of the neutronics and mass flow analyses which were completed as part of the study. That report also provides an analysis of the differences between the various recycling strategies and the underlying reactor physics...|$|R

40|$|In Sri Lanka the Dye sludge {{production}} from textile industry is large. The {{large amount of}} produced dye sludge needs to be properly managed otherwise it will cause lot of environmental problems. Currently textile industries in Sri Lanka use the landfilling method to dispose dye sludge. Because of the landfilling method lot of environmental problems are surfaced, such as emission of toxic gases, ground water pollution and bad odour in environment. This study investigates the feasibility of using the waste dye sludge as fuel called Refused Derived Fuel (RDF). The method is used to produce RDF from dye sludge is mix dye sludge with <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> available in textile industry. <b>Other</b> <b>waste</b> types which are supposed to use mix with dye sludge are fabrics, paper waste and saw dust. The mixing of waste dye sludge with <b>other</b> <b>wastes</b> in different compositions are investigated.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of electronic waste (e-waste) management in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality was undertaken in this study. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the electronic waste management practices such as generation, storage, collection, transportation and disposal in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. This was achieved through questionnaires distributed to residents in Namakgale and Phalaborwa residential areas, structured interviews with municipal workers under the Environmental Health Division and observation in the landfill site and collection points were also used in gathering information on the electronic waste management. In the study it was found that a wide range of electronic waste is generated and lighting equipment, small household equipment and ICT equipment are disposed of in large numbers in the study area. The municipality is responsible for waste management in the study area. Electronic waste generated is stored, collected and disposed together with <b>all</b> <b>other</b> domestic <b>waste</b> in the area. No segregation or recycling at household level was evident. It was also found that the municipality does not have a formal relationship with electronic waste recycling companies to eliminate the flow of electronic waste from households to the landfill site. A lack of own regulatory and by-laws on electronic waste was noted and seemed to be one of the challenges the municipality is facing. The findings highlighted the low level of community awareness regarding electronic waste. The study concluded that there is a lack or absence of good management of electronic waste storage, collection, transportation in the Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality. From the study, it is recommended that there is a need for meaningful community awareness, environmental education, formulation of by-laws and formal recycling projects for effective electronic waste in Ba-Phalaborwa Local Municipality.
