Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of <b>agricultural</b> <b>employment.</b> Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its Eurosceptic rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E

They did this both through the so-called [...] "Order of the White Feather" [...] and through the promise of home comforts for the men while {{they were at the}} front. In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women's Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women's Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric that explicitly feminized the new roles.

40|$|A {{commonly}} alleged pitfall of decentralization is that poverty, socio-economic {{inequality and}} lack of political competition allow local elites to capture local governments. This hypothesis is empirically examined using a longitudinal sample of 80 West Bengal villages concerning targeting of credit, <b>agricultural</b> input kits, <b>employment</b> programs and fiscal grants spanning the period 1978 - 98. Higher poverty, land inequality and low caste composition of the poor was associated with negligible adverse effects on targeting of private goods to the poor within villages, but with lower employment generation out of allotted funds, and significantly lower allocation of resources to the village as a whole. Political competition or literacy levels among the poor were not systematically related to targeting.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} National Sample Survey {{data for}} 1987 - 88, 1993 - 94 and 1999 - 00 {{to explore the}} relationship between rural diversification and poverty. While there is little consensus regarding the rate of poverty decline during the 1990 s, the region-level estimates provided here suggest that aggregate rural poverty fell slowly. Unlike earlier estimates, the estimates here correlate well with region-level NSS data on changes in agricultural wage rates. The paper shows that <b>agricultural</b> wage <b>employment</b> has grown over time, and that a growing fraction of agricultural labourers are uneducated and have low caste status. On aggregate the non-farm sector has not grown appreciably during the 1990 s. Non-farm employment is generally associated with education levels and social status that are rare among the poor. Econometric estimates confirm that poverty reduction is more closely associated with <b>agricultural</b> wages and <b>employment</b> levels than with non-farm employment growth. However, expansion of non-farm employment influences poverty indirectly, via an impact on agricultural wages...|$|R
