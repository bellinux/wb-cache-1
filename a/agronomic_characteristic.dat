40|$|Agricultural {{systems in}} the Western Australian wheatbelt are {{increasingly}} moving towards specialist crop production due to elevated cereal prices, depressed markets for livestock products, and ongoing labour scarcity. However, the profitability of crop-only farms is threatened by increasing levels of herbicide resistance and declining soil fertility. This study determines the value of ungrazed pasture fallows grown tactically between crop phases to address these agronomic constraints. A novel metaheuristic optimisation technique, compressed annealing, is used to determine profitable flexible land-use sequences in a complex simulation model. Tactical use of single-year, ungrazed pasture phases {{is found to be}} more valuable than the use of break crops in crop-only systems. In contrast to previous analysis, it is identified that rotation of short periods of crop and pasture is more profitable than extended phases of both. Effective weed control without dependence on selective herbicides is the key <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristic</b> determining the value of intermittent pasture phases. Accordingly, the number of single-year pasture phases employed in a sequence should increase with the severity of herbicide resistance.

40|$|Tanniferous forages, such as {{birdsfoot}} trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), are a potential {{control for the}} parasitic nematode Haemonchus contortus (barber pole worm). Gastrointestinal parasites cause huge economic loss in small ruminant production. Tanniferous forages {{have been shown to}} reduce counts of parasite eggs in feces of small ruminants. Currently the tanniferous forage Lespedza cuneate L. is used in the southern United States as a parasite control; it is not a viable option in the Northeast due to insufficient winter hardiness. Birdsfoot trefoil is adapted to the Northeast and may be a viable option as a tanniferous forage for small ruminant production if populations exist that combine anthelminthic efficacy with strong agronomic performance. To address this need, I collected data on the agricultural performance of 51 Plant Introductory (PI) accessions and six commercial cultivars. ^ In a three year field study (2013, 2014, and 2015) I evaluated growth habit, winter hardiness, pest resistance, uniformity and vigor for 57 populations. In 2015, I tested 19 PI accessions and six commercial cultivars for grazing tolerance, regrowth, and uniformity and vigor in a rotationally grazed pasture trial. Birdsfoot trefoil accessions were chosen for the studies based on condensed tannin contents reported in the literature. Tannin content and in vitro anthelminthic efficacy were compared to agronomic characteristics. ^ Growth habit was assessed using height/width ratios measured once each year. Winter hardiness was assessed as survival rate counted each spring. Birdsfoot trefoil is susceptible to potato leafhopper, damage by pests were visually evaluated. Quality was visually evaluated based on vigor and uniformity within each population. Vigor and uniformity was assessed yearly in the nursery plantings and immediately before each grazing event in the grazing trial. The eight week grazing trial allowed for two grazing events for each of the nine replications. Grazing tolerance and regrowth were measured weekly for each replication throughout the eight weeks of grazing. ^ Accessions and cultivars showed a significant difference in 2013 and 2015 for potato leaf hopper damage. There were also significant differences between accessions and cultivars for population uniformity and vigor and winter survival. A positive correlation was seen between plant survival and uniformity and vigor scores both in 2014 and 2015. PI 306182, ‘S 3149 ’, PI 262530, PI 262529, and PI 255305 were high in vigor and uniformity scores averaged across 2014 and 2015, 2013 scores were not significantly different. ‘Pardee’, ‘Leo’, ‘Empire’ and ‘Bull’ were high in uniformity and vigor scores for commercial cultivars averaged across 2014 and 2015. Growth habit was measured in height/width ratio and significant differences were seen in 2013 and 2015 but not 2014. Cluster analysis divided the 51 accessions and six commercial cultivars into 6 clusters. Clusters did not correlate with tannin levels or efficacy but cluster means allowed for evaluation of agronomic characteristics of similar populations. All six commercial cultivars were clustered together in cluster 1 (N= 18) with favorable <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristic</b> results and high anthelmintic efficacy, with the exception of ‘Bruce’. PI 193725, PI 162425, PI 180171, PI 228286 and PI 325379 are promising accessions that were included in cluster 1, ranking high across agronomic characteristics and high anthelminthic efficacy. ^ In the rotational grazing trial regrowth and combined uniformity and vigor differed significantly between populations for both grazing events. Plant survival varied widely with a low of 56. 92 % for PI 232098 and a high of 95. 06 % for ‘Empire’. After agronomic characteristics were assessed, anthelmintic efficacy and condensed tannin content were compared. In vitro efficacy and condensed tannin content showed no correlation. High efficacy was positively correlated with plant survival rates and uniformity and vigor. Regrowth was independent of anthelminthic efficacy. ^ This research identifies commercial cultivars and PI accessions with potential for anthelmintic efficacy against H. contortus and successful agronomic performance as a legume forage in the northeastern U. S. PI 193725, PI 180171, PI 162425, PI 228286, PI 325379, ‘Empire’,’Norcen’,’Bull’, ‘Pardee’ and ‘Leo’ performed well agronomically and were efficacious in in vitro test against H. contortus. ...|$|E

Prior to 1997, the <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of these new cotton varieties had not been evaluated inside by side replicated field comparisons beyond {{the level of the}} developing companies. Field tests were conducted in La Paz and Mohave Counties in 1997 examining <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of new transgenic Bt (Deltapine 5415 vs. Deltapine 32 B and 33 B) and herbicide resistant (Paymaster 1220 BGRR vs. 1244 BGRR and Stoneville 474 vs. BXN 47) and non transgenic heat tolerant (SureGrow 125 vs. 180 and 821, Stoneville 474 vs. 468, and Germain's GC 9230) cotton varieties...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} {{of genetically engineered}} crops in the United States has increased dramatically over the past decade. Differences in <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and protein expression between genetically engineered plants and their naturally recombinant non-genetically modified (GM) counterparts are not well-understood. Experimental field plots were established {{in the spring of}} 2005 near Brookings, SD with 18 different commonly used corn hybrids including three conventional hybrids and their corresponding transgenic modifications. Specific research objectives were to evaluate in a side by side comparison, the impact of the genetic modifications on <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Results show that glyphosate or insect resistance resulting from genetic modification, in the absence of significant insect pest or weed pressure and glyphosate application, were not likely to significantly alter productivity or nutrient composition of corn residue or grain. No significant differences were observed among the hybrids in average grain yield or above-ground biomass over the three years of the experiment...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sunflower and the productive and nutritional characteristics of Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown with intercropping during two different sowing seasons in the interim harvest of the Center-West region of Brazil. The experiment was conducted in the municipality of Rio Verde, Goiás (GO), using a randomized block design with a 3 x 2 + 4 factorial scheme and three replicates per treatment. The following factors were tested: three Brachiaria brizantha cultivars (Marandu palisadegrass, Piata palisadegrass and Xaraes palisadegrass) grown with intercropping in the inter-row with the sunflower cultivar Charrua in two different sowing seasons (February and March); four additional treatments of sunflower; and the three tested Brachiaria brizantha cultivars grown in monoculture. Intercropping of sunflower with the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar negatively affected the <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sunflower, and intercropping with Marandu palisadegrass and Piata palisadegrass cultivars is recommended. Preference should be given to the Xaraes palisadegrass cultivar for forage production and to the Piata palisadegrass cultivar for the production of forage with higher nutritional value. Sowing in March led to the best sunflower <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics,</b> without affecting the productive and nutritional characteristics of the forages. Intercropping of sunflower with Brachiaria brizantha cultivars is therefore a promising cultivation method for the production of achenes and forage during the inter-harvest in the Center-West region of Brazil...|$|R
40|$|If agronomic {{variables}} {{related to}} vigor and yield of crops could be reliably estimated from multispectral data, then crop growth and yield models could be implemented for large areas. The objectives of these experiments were to determine relationships of key <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and spectral properties of crops and to integrate spectral and meteorological data for forecasting crop yields. Reflectance data of corn, wheat, and soybeans were acquired with radiometers that simulate Landsat MSS and TM sensors. The spectral indices, greenness, and normalized difference were highly correlated with leaf area index (LAI) and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Grain yields were more highly related to APAR cumulated {{during the growing season}} than to maximum LAI or LAI duration. A model which simulated the daily effects of weather and APAR on growth accounted for 85 % of the variation in corn yields. The concept of estimating <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> using spectral data represents a viable approach for merging spectral and meteorological data for crop forecasting models...|$|R
40|$|Bananas are {{tropical}} fruits grown world-wide {{playing a}} key role in market trade and especially used as main food source for low income populations. In Brazil, bananas are mainly consumed in natura, occupying the second largest internal market. Nevertheless, this crop presents low availability of productive commercial varieties with good <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A strategy undertaken to solve this problem is the development of new cultivars through conventional genetic breeding methods. However, this strategy presents some obstacles such as female sterility and low number of seeds. In order to overcome these shortcomings, use of mutation induction aiming the selection of mutants with desirable <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> seems to have great potential for developing new cultivars. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the genetic variability in putative banana Pacovan (AAB genome, subgroup Prata Type) mutants submitted to gamma ray irradiation, using a set of agronomical and molecular data (ISSR markers). The distance between the putative Pacovan mutants varied from 0. 26 to 0. 64 with cophenetic correlation coef?cient of 0. 7669. Four mutants were selected based on best agronomical characteristics and height. This data also shows that there is variability that can be explored after the irradiation of Pacovan banana mutants, which can be used in the genetic breeding program of banana aiming to develop short new varieties that also present good <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This is the first attempt to use combined data in order to evaluate the genetic variability in putative banana mutants. 2011 Também disponível em:.

40|$|Potato late blight {{caused by}} the fungus Phytophthora infestans is the most {{important}} disease in the world. Developing potatoes resistant to late blight is a major breeding effort around the world. International Potato Center (CIP) developed a potato population with durable resistance to late blight. These clones (B 3 C 1) were bred in Peru under short-day conditions, growing in long-day conditions such as Korea is not feasible. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate late blight resistance and major <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of CIP’s breeding lines, and agronomic potential of segregating progeny from B 3 C 1 under long-day conditions in Korea. Late blight resistance of B 3 C 1 clones was evaluated in naturally infested fields. AUDPC (Area Under Disease Progress Curve) values of all B 3 C 1 clones were significantly lower than those of control varieties Atlantic and Haryeong, indicating B 3 C 1 clones have high levels of resistance. However, most of the B 3 C 1 clones had lower tuber yield compared to control cultivars, presumably due to differences in adaptability to long-day conditions. Two clones, 381580. 30 and 392635. 54 were susceptible to common scab (Streptomyces scabies) and 384398. 56 and 393382. 44 had a high percentage of tuber disorders. Four clones, including 391047 - 34, had relatively high marketable yield, high specific gravity, and desirable <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> To develop clones highly resistant to late blight and with good adaptability in long-day condition, B 3 C 1 clones were crossed with Korean breeding lines. Through individual selection for several years, 25 clones were selected as promising lines with good <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> and high resistance to late blight. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic crops {{have proven}} {{commercial}} utility but are created using processes known to produce undesirable variability known as somaclonal variation. This reduces {{the utility of}} transgenic germplasm to the plant breeder and complicates assessments of transgene-encoded phenotypes. Backcrossing transgenes into a wild-type genome is one solution, but producing near-isogenic lines requires a lengthy and resource-intensive process of multiple crosses. However, an abbreviated breeding scheme involving a single backcross to the wild-type parent used to produce a transgenic line, which would replace 75 % of the variant alleles, should produce transgenic lines with improved performance. Comparisons were made of 'Conlon' barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), primary transgenic lines derived from Conlon, and lines derived from single backcrosses of primary transgenic lines to Conlon. The primary transgenic lines were different from Conlon for many <b>agronomic</b> and malting <b>characteristics.</b> Most of the backcross-derived lines {{did not differ significantly}} from Conlon for most <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The backcross-derived lines were also similar to Conlon for malting quality traits but showed more differences than for <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Differences between lines encoding TRI 101 versus lines encoding PDR 5 suggested that PDR 5 insertion or expression may have affected malting quality. It is concluded that a single backcross is an effective, rapid, and inexpensive method for creating superior transgenic lines. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} apply {{precision}} agriculture techniques in coffee production, using correlation {{analysis in the}} definition of management zones. This work was carried out in a 22 -ha area of coffee (Coffea arabica L.), cv. &# 8216;Topázio MG 1190 &# 8217;, which was sampled on a regular grid, using a topographic GPS, totaling 64 georeferenced samples (on average, 2. 9 points per ha). Descriptive analysis was used in the data, followed by Pearson&# 8217;s correlation analysis at 0. 05 significance between soil chemical attributes, <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the plants and altitude. It was possible to verify the correlation of soil chemical attributes, <b>agronomic</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the plants and altitude with coffee yield. Altitude was the variable most correlated with coffee yield through correlation analysis. Therefore, it was chosen as the best variable to define management zones and thematic maps capable to support coffee farmers. Three maps were generated to characterize the area in two, three and four management zones. There was a direct influence on mean yield...|$|R
