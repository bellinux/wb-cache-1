40|$|This book {{covers all}} aspects of Electromagnetic <b>Aquametry.</b> It {{summarizes}} the wide area of metrology and its applications in electromagnetic sensing of moist materials. The physical properties of water in various degrees of binding interacting with electromagnetic fields is presented by model systems. The book describes measurement methods and sensors in the frequency domain, TDR-techniques for environmental problems, methods and sensors for quality assessment of biological substances, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Environmental sciences, as well as civil and geoengineering, fossil fuels, food and pharmaceutical science are the main fields of application. A very wide frequency sprectrum is used for dielectric measurement methods, but the microwave range is clearly dominant. Multiparameter methods as well as methods of principal components and artificial neural networks for density independent measurements are described...|$|E

Dielectric prediction based on different moisture content, m. c. for measurement of peat and sand soils by applying {{conversion of the}} measured reflection coefficient, |G| to relative dielectric constant, er is computed via a proposed lumped element model. The microstrip ring resonator sensor is designed to operate between 0. 50 GHz and 4. 50 GHz with the resonance at 3. 20 GHz. In this work, this model {{was found to be}} accurate with an error within 5 in dielectric prediction with the commercial dielectric probe for peat soil (? 28 m. c.) and sand soil (? 10 m. c.).

40|$|Solution phase {{reactivity}} of nucleophilic fluoride reagents is attenuated by ion-pairing interactions. 1 H- 19 F HOESY competition experiments permit generation of a fluoride ion affinity {{scale in the}} weak-binding regime. Direct DFT calculations of ion pair interaction energies as well as calculated cation electrostatic potential maps {{can be used to}} predict solution phase ion pairing tendencies for closely related ammonium cations. It was found by studying the decomposition of tetra-substituted ammonium cations by fluoride that: (1) rates of E 2 decomposition is faster than the SN 2 pathway; (2) aryl substituents destabilize the cations; (3) steric strain tends to promote decomposition. This led us to prepare anhydrous trineopentylmethylammonium fluoride as a fluorinating regent with superior thermal stability. ^ We show that the reagent combination of PhIF 2 /TBAF* is a convenient and effective dehydrating agent for anhydrous fluoride salts. In conjunction with 19 F NMR spectroscopy, this reagent combination {{can be used as a}} rapid, convenient, general, and exquisitely sensitive <b>aquametry</b> method. ^ Fluorination via reductive elimination of diaryliodonium salts is investigated. Use of non-polar solvents suppresses disproportionation and leads to significant improvements in total fluorination yields. Fluoride promotes aryl ligand exchange processes of diaryliodonium species, which lowers the apparent regioselectivity of aryl fluoride extrusion from diaryliodonium fluorides under stoichiometric conditions, but this problem disappears at low fluoride ion concentration. A computational study shows that the regioselectivity is determined by transition state stability. We also show that 18 F-DOPA can be synthesized in good yield with our improved procedures. ^ Diaryliodine(III) species can also be used to functionalize arenes with a variety of nucleophiles. Aryl azide formation is found to be a robust reaction that is insensitive to change of solvent, and which offers fast access to various azido aromatic compounds. Lastly, we show that an increase in steric demand above the plane of the aromatic ring leads to a high degree of regioselectivity in reductive elimination reactions of Ar 2 I(III) salts. This effect is sufficiently large to provide stereoelectronic control of unidirectional reductive elimination (SECURE). ...|$|E
40|$|On-line <b>aquametry,</b> {{or water}} content measurement, is of {{importance}} to several branches of industry. In general, on-line measurements of water content are {{needed in order to}} improve the performance of different algorithms used for process control. The problem at hand might seem straightforward at first glance. However, currently there exists no standardized "of the shelf" solutions for on-line moisture measurements in granulate materials. The focus of this thesis is on-line measurements of moisture in iron ore concentrate. The moisture content of the concentrate is very important {{to the quality of the}} manufactured pellets. The water concentration within the concentrate might vary considerably compared to the water content at the surface. This makes it difficult to use remote sensing technologies such as IR, NIR etc. Hence, the long term objective of this project is to develop a low price sensor that can be embedded into the concentrate and make on-line measurements. The probe would most likely be an embedded system, preferably communicating with Radio Frequency Identification technology (RFID). However, this vision can only be realized, in conjunction with a robust measurement method. This thesis investigates two different methods that utilizes fundamentally different physical properties of the material to detect water: both of which might be suitable to incorporate into an RFID tag. The properties investigated are changes in heat conduction and changes in electrical capacitance of the system as the mositure content varies. The first method is frequently referred to in literature as the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse or DPHP and is based on the principe how heat transfer in a granulate material. The second method is named Capacitance Probe method (CP) where a parallel plate capacitor is used to drive a clock circuit. The frequency in the resonant circuit is determined by the electrical properties of the concentrate, which in turn is dependent on the moisture content. In order to thoroughly evaluate the two methods they were first analyzed theoretically. The purpose of the theoretical study was to optimize the design of the experimental equipment. With the acquired information a measurement system was constructed. Some problems with the design did eventhough occur, the scale of the heat probes were to large, leading to very long response times an poor signal to noise ratio. To the capacitance probe, there were problems to spread the concentrate evenly between the capacitor plates. Two sets of measurements were performed. First, a number of experiments in the laboratory, with the water content kept at controlled levels, then to test the performance of the developed system in an industrial environment a second set of experiments were conducted at a concentrate silo at the LKAB pellet plant in Kiruna. The outcome of the experiments performed in laboratory showed that both methods could detect water in iron ore concentrate. The standard deviation of the measurements of the capacitance probe method was 0. 35 % (mass percent) moisture. The Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse method showed random disturbances, but a clear correlation was detected. Unfortunately the capacitance probe method measurements at LKAB were inconclusive. The Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse method could, with measurements of the dry density of the material, show a correlation between water content and changes in heat conduction. One of the causes of the inconclusiveness at LKAB are discrepancies in packing density. When water is added to the material and the material is subjected to mechanical stress the particles tend to group together, the process is called agglomeration. This affects the density of the concentrate. In conclusion, both investigated methods are suitable when measuring moisture content in concentrate. Minor modifications of the sensor design would most likely improve the accuracy even more. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
