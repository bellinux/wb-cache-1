5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were larger and required more food, males {{would have had}} larger territorial claims. Likewise, their larger size may have allowed the males to target larger prey than the females, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E

The Secretary of the US Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr. {{considered}} Jacob Wallenberg strongly pro-German, and in 1945 the US Federal Bureau of Investigation subjected the Bank to a blockade from engaging in business in the United States that was only lifted in 1947. Author Alan Lelchuk who interviewed, amongst others, Wallenberg's KGB interrogator, has speculated that the more powerful of the family may {{have chosen not to}} use their influence to locate Raoul as it could have drawn attention to their misdeeds, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> considered him an embarrassment, not only for being a man of morality, but his possible homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|From the 12th {{century the}} manor of Muchland was {{administered}} from Aldingham Castle. Muchland {{became known as}} Aldingham manor and in 1291 it came into the ownership of the Harrington family. In the 14th century, the Scots attacked the Furness peninsula during the Scottish Wars of Independence; {{around the same time}} coastal erosion threatened Aldingham Motte. These factors may have led to the Harrington family abandoning Aldingham and establishing the administrative centre of the manor at the newly built Gleaston Castle, though the construction work could have been the result of their growing social status, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> needed more room for a greater number of servants.|$|E

5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites {{performed in the}} cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E
