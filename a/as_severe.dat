30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether emergency physicians who have specific training in ultrasonography could identify <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> on review of only the PSLA and PSSA B-mode echocardiography images. Based on this study, when <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> on echocardiography is defined as absence of any cusp movement, EPs with ultrasonography training are able to identify <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> with high specificity and moderate sensitivity compared with cardiology interpretations. The strong kappa values support good inter-rater reliability between EPs when recognizing <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> This is the first known study of this kind.|$|R

30|$|A {{convenience}} sample of 60 patients with no AS, mild/moderate <b>AS</b> or <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> was selected for health record and echocardiogram review. The echocardiograms were performed in an accredited echocardiography laboratory. An EP blinded to the cardiologist’s final report reviewed the PSLA and PSSA views after the cases were randomly sorted. <b>Severe</b> <b>AS</b> was defined as no cusp movement seen by the EP reviewers. A second EP independently reviewed 25 % of randomly selected patients for inter-rater reliability. Collected data included patient demographics, EP interpretation and details of each echo view (quality, the number of cusps visualized, presence of calcification) and compared to final cardiology reports. Analyses included descriptive statistics, test characteristics for <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> and kappa for agreement.|$|R

5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin {{from one of the}} bigger vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines, while {{useful in}} the {{management}} of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management. Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting {{more than a quarter of}} people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E

40|$|Background: The proper timing for {{aortic valve}} {{surgery in the}} {{asymptomatic}} patient with <b>severe</b> aortic stenosis (<b>AS)</b> remains challenging. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the left atrial volume index (LAVI) in asymptomatic patients with <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> in comparison to symptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> patients and its relation to the degree of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and tissue Doppler measures of LV diastolic function. Methods: Thirty-four patients with <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> and preserved LV function, divided into two groups were studied. Group I comprised 17 patients with symptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS,</b> and Group II comprised 17 patients with asymptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Echocardiographic assessment of LV dimension, function, and calculation of LV mass were done. LA volume index was obtained by the biplane Simpson method. Transmitral E, A diastolic velocities, deceleration time (DT) and E/A ratio were measured. Peak S′, early (E′) and late (A′) diastolic velocities of the lateral mitral annulus were measured by tissue Doppler imaging. Results: LAVI was significantly higher in symptomatic compared to asymptomatic patients with <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> (p <  0. 0001). LAVI with a cutoff point of 39. 5  ml/m 2 was a predictor of symptoms in patients with <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> yielded an area under the curve of 0. 958, P <  0. 0001, with a sensitivity of 94 % and specificity of 89 %. LAVI had a significant positive correlation with left ventricular mass (p <  0. 014), right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) (p <  0. 009), mitral peak E (p <  0. 025), and E/E′ (p <  0. 008). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that LV mass (p <  0. 0001) and E/E′ (p <  0. 0001) were the independent predictors of increased LAVI in <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Conclusion: Left atrial volume index can predict symptoms in patients with asymptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Left ventricular mass and E/E′ were the independent predictors of increased LAVI...|$|R
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of an introduction followed by eight chapters. The introduction gives {{an overview of the}} transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure and details the patient selection process. Chapter 1 reviews the methods of determining aortic stenosis (AS) heamodynamic severity and {{the pros and cons of}} using transthoracic echocardiography versus an invasive evaluation. <b>Severe</b> <b>AS</b> may be divided into three subtypes, namely, 1) high gradient AS, 2) âparadoxicalâ low-flow, low-gradient <b>severe</b> <b>AS,</b> and 3) low ejection fraction, low-gradient (LEF-LG) <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Chapter 2 assesses the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI according to this new classification system. Chapter 3 further explores the flow-gradient classification of <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> as proposed by Dumesnil et al. The majority of patients presenting with symptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> have concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), and the appropriate management of this condi-tion is an important consideration in the overall management of patients presenting with sympto-matic <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Chapter 4 provides a comprehensive overview of the management of concomi-tant CAD among patients presenting with symptomatic <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Chapter 5 and chapter 6 deal with the high-risk subset of patients presenting with LEF-LG <b>severe</b> <b>AS.</b> Patients presenting with the latter condition have a high prevalence of concomitant CAD, and chapter 5 attempts to address the optimal strategy for managing these patients. Patients presenting with LEF-LG <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> also have a high prevalence of concomitant moderate to severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and chapter 6 assesses the effect of MR on clinical outcomes after TAVI. A new classification for pulmonary hy-pertension was recently proposed and chapter 7 investigates whether this system may be useful for further risk stratification of patients undergoing TAVI. Finally, chapter 8 investigates the impact of B-type natriuretic peptide on short term clinical outcomes after TAVI...|$|R
5|$|Fierce waves pushed {{large amounts}} of water to coastal areas in Fujairah of the United Arab Emirates, forcing roads to be closed and traffic diverted. Civil defence and police were on duty to manage the road closures, while {{municipal}} workers pumped the excess water off the roads. The road connecting Kalba and Fujairah was closed due to the road being submerged by water. The waves along the coastline were reported to be 10m (32ft) high, which destroyed about a dozen fishing boats. About 300boats were moved from the water or emptied of equipment, and overall damage to the port of Fujairah was reported <b>as</b> <b>severe.</b> A boat sank by the port, leaving its ten passengers missing.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Linfa, {{known in}} the Philippines <b>as</b> <b>Severe</b> Tropical Storm Egay, was a {{tropical}} cyclone that affected the northern Philippines, Taiwan and southern China in early July2015. The tenth named storm of the annual typhoon season, Linfa developed on July1 over in the Philippine Sea. It moved erratically westward toward the Philippines, eventually striking the island of Luzon on July4. Linfa weakened across the island, but reorganized over the South China Sea. It turned northward and strengthened to near typhoon intensity, or winds of 120km/h (75mph), but weakened as it curved to the northwest toward southern China. On July9, the storm made landfall along the Chinese province of Guangdong, dissipating the next day west of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies were able to go on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the Aegean Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% of banana crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined.

40|$|AIMS: Evaluate {{changes in}} aortic annular {{dimensions}} {{in relation to}} <b>severe</b> aortic stenosis (<b>AS)</b> and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Mean aortic annular diameters and geometries were compared between 90 <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> patients and 111 controls by multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT). All <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> patients were also dichotomized into two groups based {{on the presence of}} preserved (>/= 50 %) or impaired (< 50 %) LV ejection fraction (EF). The influence of LV geometry and function on changes in aortic annular dimensions was examined. Patients with <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> had similar aortic annular dimensions and geometries compared with controls even after correcting for baseline differences in age and body surface area (BSA). However, <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> patients with LV dysfunction (LVEF < 50 %) had significantly larger mean aortic annular diameter (26. 4 +/- 1. 9 vs. 24. 5 +/- 2. 1 mm, P < 0. 001) compared with patients with preserved LVEF. The presence of LV dysfunction, male gender, and larger BSA were independent determinants of a larger aortic annulus on MDCT. CONCLUSION: In <b>severe</b> <b>AS</b> patients, the presence of LV dysfunction, not the presence of <b>severe</b> <b>AS,</b> was an independent determinant of a larger aortic annular diameter. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
