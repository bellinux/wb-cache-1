5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's <b>anti-ice</b> system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use <b>anti-ice</b> systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Engine <b>anti-ice</b> {{was turned}} {{on for the}} two engines during taxi. The captain {{announced}} to passengers that the flaps would remain up during taxi, and {{they should not be}} worried seeing them in the retracted position. He placed an empty coffee cup on the flap handle as a reminder of the position of the flaps, a procedure used by many flight crews. The captain told the first officer they would use standard USAir contaminated runway procedures that included the use of 18 degrees flaps, and also decided that they would take off with a reduced V1 speed of 110 knots.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of the crash was pilot error, citing the flight crew’s failure to use engine <b>anti-ice</b> during ground operation and takeoff, their decision to take off with snow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain’s failure to reject the takeoff during the early stage when his attention was called to anomalous engine instrument readings.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{landed at}} Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, at midnight in snow conditions and was then parked heading directly into moderate to strong surface winds for approximately 17 hours. Because no protecting plugs were put inside the engine intakes, the wind drove {{a significant amount}} of snow into the intakes. The intake plugs were not carried as part of the aircraft's onboard equipment and they were not readily available at Edinburgh Airport. Information concerning freezing weather conditions in the aircraft manufacturer's maintenance manual had not been including in the airline's Short 360 Operations Manual and was therefore not complied with. The AAIB discovered that large volumes of snow or slush could have accumulated where {{it would not have been}} readily visible to the crew during a pre-flight inspection (the engine intakes on a Short 360 are about 2.8m (9ft) above the ground). On takeoff this snow changed the engine intake air flow, causing both engines to flame out after both engines' <b>anti-ice</b> vanes were simultaneously opened as per the standard operating procedure. It was noted by the investigators that selecting engine <b>anti-ice</b> 'on' sequentially with a time interval between would have prevented a simultaneous dual engine flameout.|$|E
50|$|Ground deicing of {{aircraft}} is commonly performed in both commercial and general aviation. The fluids {{used in this}} operation are called deicing or <b>anti-icing</b> fluids. The abbreviations ADF (Aircraft Deicing Fluid) or AAF (Aircraft <b>Anti-icing</b> Fluid) are commonly used.|$|R

40|$|Departments of {{transportation}} {{use a variety}} of strategies to effectively maintain roadways during winter while considering a number of factors such as level of service, cost, infrastructure and environmental impacts, equipment, and weather. Impacts to infrastructure, vehicles and the environment have motivated the state of California to reduce salt usage on highways. <b>Anti-icing,</b> a winter maintenance strategy based on timely application of winter maintenance chemicals before the onset of a storm, typically uses less chemical to achieve effective results. A lack of established dispersal rates, laboratory studies to verify field studies, and an understanding of the science associated with <b>anti-icing</b> principles have slowed full implementation of <b>anti-icing</b> strategies in California. This research effort focused on synthesizing available information regarding winter maintenance best practices and establishing a set of preliminary guidelines to implement <b>anti-icing</b> strategies in California.

500|$|... "The Safety Board {{views the}} {{evidence}} as conclusive {{that the primary}} factor in this accident was the reduced performance of the wing due to ice contamination. Therefore, the Safety Board evaluated {{the extent to which}} the decisions of, and procedures used by the flight crew could have contributed to the accident," [...] read the final report. Although, when the cockpit was examined, the engine <b>anti-ice</b> switch was found in the 'OFF' position, further investigations found that even slight pressure could move the switch, and the NTSB ruled this out as a contributing factor in the crash. Following the accident, USAir sent out a maintenance directive ordering engine <b>anti-ice</b> switches to be changed on F28s so they would lock into a selected position.|$|E
500|$|Several {{deviations}} {{were made}} to the standard Apache design used by the US and those exported to other countries. One major difference is the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 01/12 engines, replacing the original General Electric T700-GE-701C engines. The Rolls-Royce engine produces [...] vs. [...] for the GE T700C engine. Compared to many helicopters used by coalition forces in Afghanistan, the Apache required less modification to serve in the region due to special filters incorporated into the design. Another change is the folding blade mechanism to stow the helicopters in confined spaces; the rotor blades also have <b>anti-ice</b> protection to allow operations in Arctic environments.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the icing}} {{condition}} with weather temperature at about 24°F (-4°C), [...] the crew failed {{to activate the}} engine <b>anti-ice</b> systems, which caused the engine pressure ratio (EPR) thrust indicators to provide false readings.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{deals with}} the laboratory evaluation of the effectiveness and durability of a sodium chloride-based <b>anti-icing</b> filler in asphaltic materials. Asphalt mastics and mixtures were prepared and tested to evaluate their de-icing and <b>anti-icing</b> characteristics and compared with samples containing a conventional calcareous filler. De-icing potential was measured using the ice melting capacity tests on asphalt mastics and an acceleration of the ice melting process was recorded in presence of the <b>anti-icing</b> filler. Similar results were determined with controlled thermal and moisture conditioning of the samples. In this case, the observed effect of the <b>anti-icing</b> filler was a delay of frost formation and evolution. Asphalt mixtures were also subjected to skid resistance measurements, freezing point determinations and cycles of washing and mechanical abrasion to simulate traffic and climate effects. Finally, the kinetic of sodium chloride release in water was analyzed in order to attain a preliminary evaluation of the durability of the <b>anti-icing</b> effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper gives a brief {{description}} of the various state-of-the-art mathematical models used to simulate ice accretion and <b>anti-icing</b> simulation on an aircraft wing section. These models are implemented in the CANICE code. CANICE results from a typical icing and <b>anti-icing</b> simulation are presented in comparison with available experimental data and another icing code, LEWICE. The paper also discusses the usefulness of CANICE in reliably predicting ice accretion and in assessing <b>anti-icing</b> heat requirements for given flight and atmospheric conditions. The <b>anti-icing</b> system is modeled after a hot-air jet impinging on a flat plate from which the internal heat transfer coefficients are obtained.

40|$|<b>Anti-icing</b> of {{the inlet}} of jet engines is {{generally}} performed with high pressure heated air that is directed {{forward from the}} compressor {{through a series of}} pipes to various manifolds located near the structures to be <b>anti-iced.</b> From these manifolds, the air is directed to all flowpath surfaces that may be susceptible to ice formation. There the <b>anti-icing</b> function may be performed by either heat conduction or film heating. Unfortunately, the prospect of utilizing lighweight, high strength composites for inlet structures of jet engines has been frustrated by the low transverse thermal conductivity of such materials. It was the objective of this program to develop an advanced materials and design concept for <b>anti-icing</b> composite structures.
