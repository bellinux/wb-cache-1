5|$|The Royal Commission {{began its}} {{work and the}} {{proceedings}} were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish capital punishment. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> outcome.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the target animals to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc {{introduced}} the Supremum Justitiæ Magistratum (Collegiate Tribunal of the Jury's Supreme Magistrate) {{in order to}} establish more separation of powers in judicial decisions. Giandonato Rogadeo, an eminent European jurist, was requested to come to Malta in 1781 by de Rohan to address issues related to common law. Rogadeo went on to author the Diritto Municipale, between the year of his arrival and 1784, a law book to be used for the Castellania. During his stay in Malta, he further observed that it was not the law which was just problematic but also the judges and advocates which were corrupt. His work was opposed by the advocates and judges, with Baron Gaetano Pisani and Judge Gio Nicoló Muscat anonymously publishing works in Rome in 1783 to challenge it and aiming to keep the status quo which had limited considerations. It became the primarily Maltese law of the Code de Rohan, <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> set of laws, which brought significant reformation to criminal law. The Code incorporated previous laws introduced from former Grand Masters with a more liberal approach. It also set standard regulations for advocates, with some flexibility. It was subsequently amended with the use of bandi. The Diritto Municipale was abolished in 1854, during the British period, and replaced by a more lenient Criminal Code.|$|E

25|$|View of a German {{minority}} {{as potentially}} troublesome: From the Soviet perspective, {{shared by the}} communist administrations installed in Soviet-occupied Europe, the remaining large German populations outside postwar Germany were seen as a potentially troublesome 'fifth column' that would, because of its social structure, interfere with the envisioned Sovietisation of the respective countries. The Western allies also saw {{the threat of a}} potential German 'fifth column', especially in Poland after the agreed-to compensation with former German territory. In general, the Western allies hoped to secure a more lasting peace by eliminating the German minorities, which they thought could be done in <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> manner.|$|E

25|$|The {{objective}} is also cultural. The movement aims {{to bring a}} new look on Syria by focusing on its cultural diversity and richness, beyond ubiquitous images of despair. According to Leila Shahid for La Marseilleise, Syria is a great cultural nation, a pluricultural leader of artistic creation. Journalist Alain Laurens commented that the Syrian cultural caravan’s involvement makes the public forget during the performance about all the bombings in Aleppo and Damascus and make room for <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> and fraternal communion. It {{is a way of}} showing that the Syrian cultural scene and its artists is alive and thriving. Finally, the road trip allows the Cultural Caravan to make art and culture come to the people, therefore going upstream of artistic and cultural centralisation. Most of the time, the exhibition is set up outside, making it accessible to a greater number.|$|E
25|$|Several Acts of Parliament {{allowed the}} {{building}} of the Asylum, and statutes have driven the subsequent changes in mental health care. The background {{to the creation of the}} asylum included the 1808 County Asylums Act which was passed after an expensive war against France. This recognised lunatics as being ill, as being held in the wrong institutions and perhaps having a chance to recover if given the right type of treatment. Non-recovery would mean that the insane pauper would always need to be looked after, which would cost more in the long run. Some parishes were growing in population due to industrialisation, and the existing charitable institutions and workhouses could not cope with the increasing demand. The recognition of insanity as an illness can almost be seen as a cost-saving measure rather than <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> one.|$|E
25|$|Spender {{returns to}} the rest of the expedition. He carries a gun and, {{claiming}} to be the last Martian, shoots six of his crew-mates, including one with sympathy towards the Martians from his Cherokee ancestry. Captain Wilder approaches under a white flag and has a short discussion with Spender during which the archaeologist explains that if he manages to kill off the expedition it may delay human colonization of the planet for a few more years, possibly long enough that the expected nuclear war on Earth will protect Mars from human colonization completely. Although he opposes Spender's methods, Captain Wilder somewhat agrees with his attitude towards colonization and wishes for him <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> death. He {{returns to the}} others and joins them as they pursue Spender, and Wilder shoots Spender in the chest during the fight before he has the opportunity to be killed by anyone else. The captain later knocks out the teeth of Parkhill, another expedition member, after catching him in the act of shooting at the ruined cities' towers and windows for target practice.|$|E

25|$|SS man Zweiling stumbles upon Höfel and his friend, fellow {{communist}} Pippig, as {{they play}} with the child. Knowing well that the American Army is approaching, Zweiling is convinced to turn a blind eye, hoping to present himself as <b>a</b> <b>humane</b> guard to the Americans. His wife tells him {{to get rid of}} the boy to avoid punishment by his superiors. Zweiling writes a denunciation letter to the Gestapo, making it appear as if it was composed by a prisoner. Kluttig and Reineboth, two other SS officers, realize that Zweiling was the informant, but choose to ignore it; they begin to search for the child. Kluttig is keen on massacring the camp's surviving prisoners, but commandant Schwahl forbids it, fearing American retribution - although he knows of the secret resistance. Kluttig and Reineboth brutally torture Höfel and Kropinski, but they refuse to tell the boy's whereabouts. The resistance's leaders meet to discuss the crisis, that may bring about an SS crackdown before their planned uprising. They determine to save the child, who is hidden in a barrack.|$|E
