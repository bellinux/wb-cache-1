40|$|Long-term {{facilitation}} (LTF) {{is a form}} {{of respiratory}} neuroplasticity frequently induced by acute intermittent isocapnic hypoxia (AIH, three 5 min isocapnic hypoxic episodes). Although repetitive <b>apnoeas</b> are a frequent natural occurrence producing brief (< 30 s) episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia, it is unknown if repetitive <b>apnoeas</b> also elicit LTF. Apnoea-induced LTF may preserve upper airway patency during sleep, thereby limiting further apnoeic events. We tested the hypothesis that repeated, brief ventilator-induced <b>apnoeas</b> are sufficient to induce serotonin-dependent phrenic and hypoglossal (XII) LTF in anaesthetized rats. Anaesthetized, male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to three or six 25 s ventilator <b>apnoeas</b> with 5 min intervals, and compared to time control and AIH-treated rats. Three and six ventilator <b>apnoeas</b> induced phrenic and XII LTF with a magnitude similar to AIH. Both apnoea-induced and AIH-induced LTF were associated with a decreased CO 2 recruitment threshold for phrenic and XII activity (∼ 4 mmHg). Spinal methysergide, a serotonin receptor antagonist, blocked apnoea-induced LTF but not changes in the CO 2 -recruitment threshold. Thus, brief ventilator <b>apnoeas</b> elicit phrenic and XII LTF. Similar to AIH-induced LTF, apnoea-induced LTF is serotonin dependent, and the relevant serotonin receptors for phrenic LTF are located in the cervical spinal cord. Apnoea-induced LTF may have implications for the maintenance of breathing stability, particularly during sleep...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) {{represents}} worldwide {{a clinical}} condition with increasing prevalence, high social, economical and epidemiological impact. Even if new pharmacological and non-pharmacological approachs have been recently used, mortality remains high in general population {{and quality of}} life is poor in these patients. DISCUSSION The association between CHF and sleep disorders is frequent but still undervalued: sleep <b>apnoeas</b> in CHF produce negative effects on cardiovascular system and an aggravation of prognosis. CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) is commonly used to treat sleep <b>apnoeas</b> in patients without cardiac involvement and it is also used in first line treatment of acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema thanks to its hemodynamic and ventilatory effects. The addition of nightly CPAP to standard aggressive medical therapy in patients with CHF and sleep <b>apnoeas</b> reduces the number of <b>apnoeas,</b> reduces the blood pressure, and the respiratory and cardiac rate, reduces the activation of sympathetic nervous system, the left ventricular volume and the hospitalization rate; besides CPAP increases the left ventricular ejection fraction, amd the oxygenation, it improves quality of life, tolerance to exercise and seems to reduce mortality in patients with a higher <b>apnoeas</b> suppression. CONCLUSIONS These implications suggest to investigate sleep <b>apnoeas</b> in patients with CHF in order to consider a possible treatment with CPAP. Further studies need to be developed to confirm the use of CPAP in patients with CHF without sleep disorders...|$|R

40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) is an inborn neurodevelopmental disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP 2). Besides mental retardation, most patients suffer from potentially life-threatening breathing arrhythmia. To study its pathophysiology, we performed comparative {{analyses of the}} breathing phenotype of Mecp 2 −/y knockout (KO) and C 57 BL/ 6 J wild-type mice using the perfused working heart–brainstem preparation (WHBP). We simultaneously recorded phrenic and efferent vagal nerve activities to analyse the motor pattern of respiration, discriminating between inspiration, postinspiration and late expiration. Our results revealed respiratory disturbances in KO preparations that {{were similar to those}} reported from in vivo measurements in KO mice and also to those seen in RTT patients. The main finding was a highly variable postinspiratory activity in KO mice that correlated closely with breathing arrhythmias leading to repetitive <b>apnoeas</b> even under undisturbed control conditions. Analysis of the pontine and peripheral sensory regulation of postinspiratory activity in KO preparations revealed: (i) prolonged <b>apnoeas</b> associated with enhanced postinspiratory activity after glutamate-induced activation of the pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus; and (ii) prolonged <b>apnoeas</b> and lack of reflex desensitization in response to repetitive vagal stimulations. We conclude that impaired network and sensory mediated synaptic control of postinspiration induces severe breathing dysfunctions in Mecp 2 −/y KO preparations. As postinspiration is particularly important for the control of laryngeal adductors, the finding might explain the upper airway-related clinical problems of patients with RTT such as <b>apnoeas,</b> loss of speech and weak coordination of breathing and swallowing...|$|R

We investigated whether young diabetic children with or without diabetic neuropathy have ventilatory dysfunction during sleep and if so, whether these autonomic changes {{are related to the}} duration of diabetes and glycaemic control. METHODS: We studied 25 children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (19 boys, mean age 7. 72 +/- 1. 99 years). All patients were insulin-dependent at diagnosis; blood samples for HbA 1 c assay were collected on the morning before testing and at 3 -month intervals during the preceding year. Patients and control subjects (20 age-matched healthy children, 15 boys) underwent overnight polysomnography. RESULTS: More diabetic patients than control subjects had sleep <b>apnoeas</b> (p = 0. 006); <b>apnoeas</b> in patients also lasted longer (p = 0. 07). Patients with poorly controlled diabetes had more <b>apnoeas</b> than patients with well-controlled diabetes and than healthy control subjects (p < 0. 0001).

Given that PACAP is localized in brainstem regions associated with respiratory chemosensitivity, we examined whether PACAP-null neonates have reduced respiratory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Using unrestrained, whole-body, flow-through plethysmography we found that, by postnatal day 4, the PACAP-null neonates had significantly reduced ventilation during baseline breathing, and blunted responses to both hypoxia (10 % O 2 – 90 % N 2) and hypercapnia (8 % CO 2 – 92 % air). To determine whether the respiratory phenotype of the PACAP-null mice may contribute to their greater neonatal mortality, we used ECG to examine respiration and cardiovascular function of littermates. We demonstrate that, under conditions that exacerbate mortality of knockout but not wild-type animals, PACAP-deficient mice experience prolonged <b>apnoeas</b> that precede atrio-ventricular block. Both <b>apnoeas</b> and atrio-ventricular block were absent in wild-type littermates.

Therefore, it was studied whether airway irritation by sulfur dioxide (SO 2) would enhance respiratory allergic reactions to trimellitic anhydride (TMA), using a rat model. Brown Norway (BN) rats were topically sensitized, subsequently exposed for a single time or repeatedly to 300 ppm SO 2, and challenged by inhalation to a distinctly irritating or minimally irritating concentration of TMA after the (last) SO 2 exposure. Repeated exposure to SO 2 alone reduced breathing frequency during exposure, and caused epithelial alterations including hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells into nasal tissues, larynx, trachea, and bronchi/bronchioli. Histopathological changes were less prominent after 1 day of SO 2 exposure.

The SO 2 -induced replacement of normal respiratory epithelium by less sensitive, squamous epithelium may offer an explanation for the, unexpected, reduced allergic manifestation.

Males of Mecp 2 -deficient mice (Mecp 2 (-/y)) also develop breathing symptoms, with erratic rhythm and life-threatening <b>apnoeas</b> from postnatal day 30 (P 30), leading to respiratory distress and premature death at around P 60. We investigated the respiratory function of conscious Mecp 2 (-/y) mice at P 40 -P 60 using conventional whole-body plethysmography, double-chamber plethysmography and chest EMG recordings. Double-chamber plethysmography revealed a persistent increase in respiratory work-load with enlarged chest movements, but no subsequent increase of tidal volume thus revealing a mismatch between airflow and muscle work-load. <b>Apnoeas</b> occurred with cessation of both chest movements and ventilation, but some (40 %) developed with persisting rhythmic chest EMG discharges or chest movements without respiratory airflow, suggesting respiratory efforts against obstructed airways.
