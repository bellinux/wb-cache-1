5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the ice age 4.5 million years ago, baleen whales did not exceed 10 meters (33 feet) in length. But when the ice sheets caused their food sources to concentrate in certain <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> certain times of years, they began to increase in size while smaller species became more rare.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{choke point}} has been Main Street in New Paltz, a section shared by NY32 and NY299.

It is also a well-developed commercial area in a college town, with ample street parking.|$|E
40|$|We {{agree with}} Abdellaoui et al that the <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk may explain up to 50 % of infarct size, as {{this has been}} shown in {{experimental}} trials. In our randomized trial of intracoronary versus intravenous abcix-imab bolus administration, we did not assess the <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk, which might be a limitation. 1 However, because this was a randomized trial, differences in <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk are extremely unlikely given that all other baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 random-ized groups. Furthermore, the sum of ST-segment elevation at baseline (before percutaneous coronary intervention) and the number of elevated leads were similar between the treatment groups, which indicates the same <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk. ST-segment evaluation might have a similar value for assessment of the <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk as the somewhat more inaccurate left ventricular angiography. 2, 3 As stated in our discus-sion, magnetic resonance is now able to assess the <b>area</b> <b>at</b> risk retrospectively from T 2 -weighted images (edema imaging). 4 W...|$|R

5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast {{for most of the}} distance to Cornwall. Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential <b>areas.</b> <b>At</b> Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews {{of the game}} featured {{a departure from the}} third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4-style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat to a greater degree than the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for his pistol and an option for the player to barricade <b>areas.</b> <b>At</b> the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{station was}} opened on 10 October 1934, when the municipally owned company Akersbanerne had {{completed}} the Sognsvann Line from Majorstuen to Sognsvann. Residential <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> Sogn, Tåsen and Berg were starting to grow, in pace with a larger suburban development plan. Akersbanerne bought new property along the line, upon which new houses were to be designed by the Norwegian architect Kristofer Lange (1886–1977).|$|E

5|$|Further {{dividing}} {{the varieties of}} fancy rats are the many different markings. Pet rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically {{in reference to the}} patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s the stand {{accommodated}} the away fans. Previously {{it was open}} to home supporters. The lower tier of the old stand was terracing and this was closed off {{by the turn of}} the 1980s due to it being a fire hazard as the terracing steps were wooden. The front concrete terracing remained and was one of the last standing <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> a Premiership ground.|$|E
5|$|Major {{construction}} at Tikal was already {{taking place in}} the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400–300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> this time – a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.|$|E

At Middleton Park Circus {{there is an}} Aldi supermarket (opened in Spring 2014 {{on the site of}} the former Middleton Arms pub), a Sainsburys Local supermarket, Boots chemist, a Post Office and several independent traders. Also in Spring 2014, Asda opened a supermarket next to the Middleton District Centre; this should provide over 300 jobs. The District Centre itself has several traders but had failed to develop.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{residential}} <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> Chakokot possess {{one or more}} bottle-shaped underground storage chambers, known as chultunob, with 14 having been found as of 2001. Because of the thick vegetation at the site, investigators consider that there are probably more to be found. These chultunob were closed with disc-shaped stone lids, {{many of which were}} found either still in place or close to the aperture of the chultun to which it belonged. The stone lids were without perforations so it is supposed that the chambers were used to store dry goods rather than water.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> lower elevations. Species that commonly {{occur with}} sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and {{winter in the}} open ocean of the cold {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a {{chain of}} themed <b>areas</b> <b>at</b> Universal Parks & Resorts based on the Harry Potter media franchise, {{adapting}} elements from the film series and original novels by Rowling.
