40|$|Foreign {{tax credit}} systems limit {{the extent to}} which foreign tax credits can be used to offset tax {{liability}} in the taxpayer’s home country. We examine how two methods of limiting foreign tax credits, separate limitations based on type or source of income or an overall limitation aggregating across all foreign income, affect the optimal allocation of capital. We show that when investment opportunities exist in both low-tax and high-tax countries, a separate limitation method will always result in an inefficient allocation of capital. In some circumstances, an overall limitation can result in the optimal allocation of capital. In other cases, both limitation methods will result in an inefficient allocation of capital. In these cases either limitation method can be relatively more efficient. Simulations show that the potential differences in economic welfare under the <b>alternative</b> <b>limitation</b> methods can be significant. We consider the limitation methods in multiple settings, including the presence of pre-existing foreign income and allocation rules, such as interest allocation.

40|$|We {{compared}} an idealised {{mathematical model}} of {{the lower part of}} the pelagic food web to experimental data from a mesocosm experiment in which the supplies of mineral nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous), bioavailable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC, as glucose), and silicate were manipulated. The central hypothesis of the experiment was that bacterial consumption of BDOC depends on whether the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is limited by organic-C or by mineral nutrients. In previous work, this hypothesis was examined qualitatively using a conceptual food web model. Here we explore the extent to which a “simplest possible ” mathematical version of this conceptual model can reproduce the observed dynamics. The model combines algal– bacterial competition for mineral nutrients (phosphorous) and accounts for <b>alternative</b> <b>limitation</b> of bacterial and diatom growth rates by organic carbon and by silicate, respectively. Due to a slower succession in the diatom–copepod, compared to the flagellate–ciliate link, silicate availability increases the magnitude and extends the duration of phytoplankton blooms induced by mineral nutrient addition. As a result, Si interferes negatively with bacterial consumption of BDOC consumption by increasing and prolonging algal–bacterial competition for mineral nutrients. In order to reproduce the difference in primary production between Si and non-Si amended treatments, we had to assume a carbon overflow mechanism in diatom C-fixation. This model satisfactorily reproduced central features observed in the mesocosm experiment, including the dynamics of glucose consumption, algal, bacterial, and mesozooplankton biomass. While the parameter set chosen allows the model to reproduce the pattern seen in bacteria...|$|E

It is a companion to other detailed reviews of the literature on thermal effects on organisms important to the region. Many factors, both natural and anthropogenic, affect water temperatures in the region. Different environmental zones have characteristic temperatures and mechanisms that affect them. There are specific biotic adaptations to environmental temperatures. Life-cycle strategies of salmonids, in particular, are attuned to annual temperature patterns. Physiological and behavioral requirements on key species form the basis of present water temperature criteria, but may need to be augmented with more concern for environmental settings. There are many issues in the setting of standards, and these are discussed. There are also issues in compliance. Alternative temperature-regulating mechanisms are discussed, as are examples of actions to control water temperatures in the environment.

The scheme is applicable to all existing structured peer-to-peer systems, and can be implemented on-top of any DHT. The scheme has been implemented in our DKS system, and is used to do load-balancing, end-to-end faulttolerance, and to increase the security by using distributed voting.

40|$|Biofouling in {{membrane}} bioreactors (MBRs) {{remains a}} primary challenge for their wider application, despite the growing acceptance of MBRs worldwide. Research studies on membrane fouling are extensive in the literature, {{with more than}} 200 publications on MBR fouling in the last 3 years; yet, improvements in practice on biofouling control and management have been remarkably slow. Commonly applied cleaning methods are only partially effective and membrane replacement often becomes frequent. The reason for the slow advancement in successful control of biofouling is largely attributed to the complex interactions of involved biological compounds {{and the lack of}} representative-for-practice experimental approaches to evaluate potential effective control strategies. Biofouling is driven by microorganisms and their associated extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) and microbial products. Microorganisms and their products convene together to form matrices that are commonly treated as a black box in conventional control approaches. Biological-based antifouling strategies seem to be a promising constituent of an effective integrated control approach since they target the essence of biofouling problems. However, biological-based strategies are in their developmental phase and several questions should be addressed to set a roadmap for translating existing and new information into sustainable and effective control techniques. This paper investigates membrane biofouling in MBRs from the microbiological perspective to evaluate the potential of biological-based strategies in offering viable control <b>alternatives.</b> <b>Limitations</b> of available control methods highlight the importance of an integrated anti-fouling approach including biological strategies. Successful development of these strategies requires detailed characterization of microorganisms and EPS through the proper selection of analytical tools and assembly of results. Existing microbiological/EPS studies reveal a number of implications as well as knowledge gaps, warranting future targeted research. Systematic and representative microbiological studies, complementary utilization of molecular and biofilm characterization tools, standardized experimental methods and validation of successful biological-based antifouling strategies for MBR applications are needed. Specifically, in addition, linking these studies to relevant operational conditions in MBRs is an essential step to ultimately develop a better understanding and more effective and directed control strategy for biofouling. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this article is to review the current {{situation}} with regard to sodium intake in the European Union, provide an update on the efforts being made to reduce the sodium content of food products in various industries via food reformulation and identify the factors motivating food reformulation. Methods: A review was conducted of published literature as well as government and nongovernment organization websites and publications. Results: Food reformulation efforts have been made in the bread, meat, dairy and convenience foods industries. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of < 5  g/day of dietary salt intake (< 2  g/day sodium) provides an internationally accepted baseline for reformulation efforts. Most Europeans continue to consume salt above the recommended limit.

A majority of the writers have dealt with either case histories of successful diversification or with qualitative check-off lists to be used in analyzing specific diversification opportunities.

This paper falls in the latter category. As a first step, diversification is defined and distinguished from other company growth alternatives. Typical growth perspectives are described which may motivate a company to diversify. Diversification objectives are established and related to the company's long-range objectives. A two-step evaluation scheme is proposed for selection of the preferred diversification strategy.
