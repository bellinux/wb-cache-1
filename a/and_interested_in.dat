5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s.

Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman.

25|$|The two soon met. Even though Bernhardt {{was appalled}} by Damala's {{insolence}} towards her, she was nevertheless strongly {{attracted to him}} and soon fell {{madly in love with}} the Greek.

Prior to moving to India, he {{conducted}} some experiments to examine if cuckoo eggs (or more generally foreign eggs) were detected and removed by the hosts by placing eggs of one species in the nests of others. In 1835 he wrote that he had experimentally found chaffinches to remove a foreign egg when placed in their clutch. He also suggested the idea of replacing the original clutch with another clutch but with a single foreign egg and suggested based on his own results that either the foreign eggs would be discarded or that the birds would abandon the nest.|$|E
25|$|The Keetoowah Nighthawk Society placed great {{trust in}} Cornelius {{in matters of}} ritual and religion.

Cornelius was a scholar of Iroquois history and culture <b>and</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> bringing Keetoowah ceremonies closer to Iroquois traditions. While the prehistoric origin of the Cherokee is shrouded in mystery, their language is Iroquoian and they shared many traditions with the Six Nations. Cornelius believed that the Six Nations of the Iroquois had originally been seven nations or fires, and the Cherokee tribe had migrated south and was the seventh lost fire of the Iroquois. At the suggestion of Cornelius, the Keetoowah adopted a number of ritualistic elements of the Iroquois culture that were compatible with Cherokee tradition. After the innovations, the ritual organization of the Keetoowah fires very closely approximated the Cherokee town fires in aboriginal times.|$|E
