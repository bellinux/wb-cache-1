5|$|Kirby's Dream Land is an action-platformer. Like {{many other}} platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games, levels are side-scrolling, {{played on a}} {{two-dimensional}} plane in which Kirby can move left or right as well as jump. Kirby's main method of attack is to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, after which the player can either swallow them or spit them out as a projectile attack. In addition to running and jumping, Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> air and flapping his arms. Flying can be done indefinitely; however, while flying, Kirby's only method of attack is to release the air puff held in his mouth which cancels his flight.|$|E
25|$|Blackeye gobies are diurnal, being {{primarily}} active during daytime. They feed {{almost exclusively}} on small crustaceans and mollusks. The most common prey include amphipods, copepods, isopods, decapods (particularly hermit crabs), snails, and clams. Other less important prey include annelids and other invertebrates. Parts of echinoderms (mostly sea urchins) and bryozoans are {{also found in the}} contents of the stomachs of blackeye gobies, though this is likely the result of incidental ingestion rather than true predation. The preferred prey can vary by season depending on their abundance. Blackeye gobies have also been observed feeding directly on chemosynthetic bacterial mats. It is of particular significance if substantiated, as {{it would be the first}} known instance of a fish deriving nutrition directly from chemosynthetic bacteria. Blackeye gobies feed mostly by simply picking off the prey directly from the substrate. Occasionally, they may feed by taking <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> substrate, spitting it out, then picking off edible prey as it drifts to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Mouth brooders - carry eggs or larvae {{in their}} mouth. Mouth brooders can be ovophiles or larvophiles. Ovophile or egg-loving mouth-brooders {{lay their eggs}} in a pit, which are sucked up {{into the mouth of}} the female. The small number of large eggs hatch in the mother's mouth, and the fry remain there for a period of time. Fertilization often occurs with the help of egg-spots, which are {{colorful}} spots on the anal fin of the male. When the female sees these spots, she tries to pick up the egg-spots, but instead gets <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> sperm, fertilizing the eggs in her mouth. Many cichlids and some labyrinth fish are ovophile mouthbrooders. Larvophile or larvae-loving mouth-brooders lay their eggs on a substrate and guard them until the eggs hatch. After hatching, the female picks up the fry and keeps them in her mouth. When the fry can fend for themselves, they are released. Some eartheaters are larvophile mouthbrooders.|$|E

Becky Bain from Idolator wrote: [...] "Azealia sports bull horns, wields a baseball bat, seductively licks a Popsicle and takes <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> a hot dog."

500|$|Just as Cet is exulting in {{his victory}} over the full warrior {{contingent}} of Ulster present, the Ulster hero Conall Cernach enters the hostel, and leaps {{into the middle of}} the hall to roars of welcome from the Ulaid. Cet and Conall acknowledge each other in an exchange of archaic rhetorical verses, and Cet concedes that Conall is a better warrior than he. Cet adds that his brother Anlúan would best Conall in a contest: It is our misfortune that he is not in the house.' 'Oh but he is,' said Conall, and taking Anlúan's head from his wallet he threw it at Cet's breast so that <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> blood spattered over the lips." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{also used}} the book to {{describe}} in detail her belief that most Americans inflicted harm on themselves with their typical diets, which was excessively high in salt, refined sugars, pesticides, growth hormones, preservatives and other additives, and thereby [...] "devitalized" [...] of its essential nutrients by the excessive processing. As a result, she says countless adults and most children in the U.S. [...] "have never once had <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> genuinely wholesome food."

2500|$|Burgess's {{interest}} in language {{was reflected in}} the invented, Anglo-Russian teen slang of A Clockwork Orange (Nadsat), and in the movie Quest for Fire (1981), for which he invented a prehistoric language (Ulam) for the characters. His interest is reflected in his characters. In The Doctor is Sick, Dr Edwin Spindrift is a lecturer in linguistics who escapes from a hospital ward which is peopled, as the critic Saul Maloff put it in a review, with [...] "brain cases who happily exemplify varieties of English speech."

2500|$|He {{subsequently}} {{progressed to}} Formula Libre and bought himself {{a dark blue}} Lotus 24. With this car he won the Gold Flake Trophy at Leinster and a race at Phoenix Park, and encouraged by this success, decided to move up to Formula One. He drove to Sicily with one mechanic in a VW pickup, having entered the 1964 Mediterranean Grand Prix at the Autodromo di Pergusa. In practice, having posted the eighth fastest time and outqualifying his closest rival Peter Revson by a second, Gubby's Lotus suffered a wheel failure and he crashed heavily through chainlink fencing. [...] "Lotuses were always falling apart... I ended up upside down in the woods, cocooned in wire with <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> leaves and grass," [...] he recalled. He was able to disconnect the battery to help prevent a fire, and some Italian mechanics {{arrived on the scene}} to cut him free, but he was unable {{to take part in the}} race. The wheel that failed was one that he had obtained from the BRP team after one of his own wheels had developed a crack.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 8 of tractate Yoma in the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud and chapter 4 of tractate Kippurim (Yoma) in the Tosefta {{interpreted}} {{the laws of}} self-denial in [...] and [...] The Mishnah taught that on Yom Kippur, one must not eat, drink, wash, anoint oneself, put on sandals, or have sexual intercourse. Rabbi Eliezer (whom the halachah follows) taught that a king or bride may wash the face, and a woman after childbirth may put on sandals. But the sages forbad doing so. The Tosefta taught that one must not put on even felt shoes. But the Tosefta taught that minors can {{do all these things}} except put on sandals, for appearance's sake. The Mishnah held a person culpable to punishment for eating an amount of food equal to a large date (with its pit included), or for drinking <b>a</b> <b>mouthful</b> <b>of</b> liquid. For the purpose of calculating the amount consumed, one combines all amounts of food together, and all amounts liquids together, but not amounts of foods together with amounts of liquids. The Mishnah obliged one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and drank to bring only one sin-offering. But one who unknowingly or forgetfully ate and performed labor had to bring two sin-offerings. The Mishnah did not hold one culpable who ate foods unfit to eat, or drank liquids unfit to drink (like fish-brine). The Mishnah taught that one should not afflict children at all on Yom Kippur. In the two years before they become Bar or Bat Mitzvah, one should train children to become used to religious observances (for example by fasting for several hours). The Mishnah taught that one should give food to a pregnant woman who smelled food and requested it. One should feed to a sick person at the direction of experts, and if no experts are present, one feeds a sick person who requests food. The Mishnah taught that one may even give unclean food to one seized by a ravenous hunger, until the person's eyes are opened. Rabbi Matthia ben Heresh said that one who has a sore throat may drink medicine even on the Sabbath, because it presented the possibility of danger to human life, and every danger to human life suspends the laws of the Sabbath.|$|E
