25|$|Berger {{has also}} curated {{a number of}} race-related concept-based exhibitions, {{including}} For <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>To</b> See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights—a joint venture of the National Museum of African American History and Culture of the Smithsonian Institution and the Center for Art, Design & Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This exhibition {{was the first to}} comprehensively examine the role played by visual images in shaping, influencing, and transforming the modern struggle for racial equality and justice in the United States. It opened at International Center of Photography in New York in May 2010 and traveled to the DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Smithsonian National Museum of American History (DC), National Civil Rights Museum (Memphis), Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture (Baltimore), Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, MA) and other venues. For <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>to</b> See was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities as the twelfth NEH on the Road exhibition, an initiative that adapted the exhibition in a smaller, lower security version that will travel to up to 50 more venues, mostly smaller and mid-size institutions across the country over a ten-year period from 2012 to 2023.|$|E

25|$|Caine ignored {{their advice}} but did adapt the plot and {{characters}} {{to some of}} T.E. Brown's suggestions. He also sought the advice of two other Manxmen, A.W. Moore and Sir James Gell, particularly on the legal background of the novel. Having assembled his materials, Caine wrote the novel at his house in Bexley {{in the space of}} only seven months, a feat made possible by his recycling material from his 1885 novella, She's <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>To</b> Me, in particular the central scene of Ewan's body floating back to shore. Caine visited the Isle of Man for a week in August to check the locations of some scenes in the novel and by September the novel was ready to go to the publisher. In financial need, Caine sold the copyright to Chatto & Windus for £150, signing the contract on 27 September 1887. Unfortunately for Caine, the terms of the contract meant that he did not gain the wealth of royalties when the book became a best-seller upon its release in November. Indeed, in 1921 when Caine wanted to release his Collected Works through a different publisher, he would have to pay £350 to Chatto & Windus for the rights to The Deemster.|$|E

500|$|From 1954 {{into the}} 1960s Charles toured for 300days {{a year with}} a seven-piece orchestra.

In 1954 Charles began merging gospel sounds and instruments with lyrics that addressed more secular issues. His first attempt was in the song [...] "I Got a Woman", based either on the melodies of gospel standards [...] "My Jesus Is <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] or an uptempo [...] "I Got a Savior (Way Across Jordan)". It was the first Ray Charles record that got attention from white audiences, but it made some black audiences uncomfortable with its black gospel derivatives; Charles later stated that the joining of gospel and R was not a conscious decision.|$|E

On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote [...] "a constant relationship... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe.

500|$|Royal Wedding starred Astaire and Jane Powell as a brother-sister American dancing team {{performing}} in England during {{the occasion of}} the royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip in 1947. Judy Garland was originally cast in the lead role, but was fired for absenteeism due to illness and June Allyson was to replace Garland, but then Allyson found out she was pregnant, so she was replaced by Powell. In the film, Powell's love affair with a wealthy Englishman (Peter Lawford) threatens to ruin the brother-sister act, while Astaire finds his own romance with (Sarah Churchill). The film is loosely based on Astaire's real-life career with his sister and early dancing partner Adele Astaire, who retired after marrying an English lord in 1932. The film contains one of Astaire's most famous dance sequences: the [...] "You're <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>to</b> Me" [...] number in which Astaire defies gravity by dancing first on the walls and then on the ceiling. The shot was achieved by building the set inside a rotating reinforced-steel cylindrical chamber with the camera attached to the cylinder. Both Astaire and the film's lyricist Alan Jay Lerner claimed that they thought of the idea. The film included music by Lerner and Burton Lane and was released in 1951.|$|E
500|$|Roxana Hadadi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for The Washington Post, was extremely negative towards the reality series {{due to its}} absurdity, and commented that the show: [...] "firmly captures all of Kim and Co.'s dumbest instances from the series' debut [...] from the simply self-absorbed to the downright despicable." [...] Amaya Rivera, writing about the series for Popmatters, noted: [...] "Indeed, there is something disturbing about the Kardashians' intense hunger for fame. But even worseit is downright boring to watch this family live out their tedious lives." [...] John Kubicek, the senior writer of BuddyTV, reviewed the premiere of the third season of the show and discussed {{the reason for the}} family's success by saying that: [...] "the Kardashians' fame is a lot like Möbius strip or an M. C. Escher painting." [...] Harriet Ryan and Adam Tschorn of the Los Angeles Times described Keeping Up with the Kardashians as a: [...] "Hollywood version of The Brady Bunch -- the harmless high jinks of a loving blended family against a backdrop of wealth and famous connections". Jessica Chasmar of The Washington Times said that series: [...] "illustrates our nation's moral, spiritual and cultural decay." [...] Chasmar emphasized its negative influence and noted: [...] "America of 50 years ago would regard Ms. Kardashian with a mixture of disdain and pity, embarrassed by the very idea of a young lady's most private moments being broadcast for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> see." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{version of}} her speech is found in Foxe's, Actes and Monuments and an almost {{identical}} version in Ives (2005). In a 1,318 line poem, written in French, two weeks after Anne's death, Lancelot de Carle provides a moving account of her last words and their effect on the crowd:She gracefully addressed {{the people from the}} scaffold with a voice somewhat overcome by weakness, but which gathered strength as she went on. She begged her hearers to forgive her if she had not used them all with becoming gentleness, and asked for their prayers. It was needless, she said, to relate why she was there, but she prayed the Judge of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> have compassion on those who had condemned her, and she begged them to pray for the King, in whom she had always found great kindness, fear of God, and love of his subjects. The spectators could not refrain from tears.Lancelot de Carle, a secretary to the French Ambassador, Antoine de Castelnau, was in London in May 1536, and was an eyewitness to her trial and execution.John Guy contends that Crispin de Milherve, who was an eyewitness to Anne Boleyn's trial and execution, and Lancelot de Carle have been shown by French scholars to be the same person. The poem, Épistre Contenant le Procès Criminel Faict à l'Encontre de la Royne Anne Boullant d'Angleterre, (A Letter Containing the Criminal Charges Laid Against Queen Anne Boleyn of England), provides a detailed account of Anne's early life and the circumstances relating to her arrest, trial and execution. All the accounts are similar. It is thought that Anne avoided criticising Henry to save Elizabeth and her family from further consequences, but even under such extreme pressure Anne did not confess guilt, and indeed subtly implied her innocence, in her appeal to those who might [...] "meddle of my cause".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} make {{essential}} money and acquire exposure in America, disregarding {{the advice of his}} friends, Caine’s short novel She's <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>World</b> <b>To</b> Me, was published in New York, in 1885 by Harper & Brothers. The first of his novels to be set on the Isle of Man. Under American copyright laws the book’s copyright was forfeited to Harper and Brothers, a situation unforeseen by Caine, he was incensed. The novel was never released outside America. [...] Caine recycled much of the material from the book in his later works, particularly in The Deemster. It is likely that the story is Caine’s 1883 Liverpool Mercury weekly serial entitled Danny Fayle. [...] At the time Caine and the Mercury’s editor John Lovell attempted to publish the serial as a book but were unable to find a publisher.|$|E
2500|$|Discussion of the {{literary}} genre includes whether what is represented is a history, a parable, a myth, or compound of various genres. This relates {{to the reality of}} the encounter. Sometimes the temptation narrative is taken as a parable, reading that Jesus in his ministry told this narrative to audiences relating his inner experience {{in the form of a}} parable. Or it is autobiographical, regarding what sort of Messiah Jesus intended to be. Writers including William Barclay have pointed to the fact that there is [...] "no mountain high enough in <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>to</b> see the whole world" [...] as indication of the non-literal nature of the event, and that the narrative portrays what was going on inside Jesus' mind. Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas explained, [...] "In regard to the words, 'He showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them,' we are not to understand that He saw the very kingdoms, with the cities and inhabitants, their gold and silver: but that the devil pointed out the quarters in which each kingdom or city lay, and set forth to Him in words their glory and estate." ...|$|E
