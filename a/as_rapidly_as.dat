5|$|In the east, the Red Army {{resumed their}} {{offensive}} on 12 January 1945. German forces were outnumbered twenty {{to one in}} aircraft, eleven to one in infantry, and seven to one in tanks on the Eastern Front. By {{the end of the}} month, the Red Army had made bridgeheads across the Oder, the last geographic obstacle before Berlin. The western Allies continued to advance as well, but not <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> the Red Army. The Panzer Corps conducted a successful defensive operation on 17–24 February at the Hron River, stalling the Allied advance towards Vienna. The 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps made their way towards Austria, but were slowed by damaged railways.|$|E
5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} almost <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> it rose. After {{the richest}} ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake {{and the financial}} panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{clothing}} styles {{changed over}} time, though not <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> fashions today. In the Dominate, clothing worn by both soldiers and government bureaucrats became highly decorated, with woven or embroidered stripes (clavi) and circular roundels (orbiculi) applied to tunics and cloaks. These decorative elements consisted of geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures. The use of silk increased, and courtiers {{of the later}} Empire wore elaborate silk robes. The militarization of Roman society, and the waning of cultural life based on urban ideals, affected habits of dress: heavy military-style belts were worn by bureaucrats as well as soldiers, and the toga was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. So it was a considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{interceptor}} {{would lose}} maneuverability as it {{climbed out of}} the atmosphere and its aerodynamic surfaces became less effective, so {{it would have to be}} directed onto the target <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> possible, leaving only minor fine tuning later in the engagement. This required that accurate tracks be developed for both the warhead and outgoing missile very quickly in comparison to a system like Nike B where the guidance could be updated throughout the engagement. This demanded new computers and tracking radars with much higher processing rates than the systems used on earlier Nikes. Bell suggested that their transistor offered the solution to the data processing problem.|$|E

5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained {{immersed in a}} disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.|$|E
5|$|From late April 1916, after a German-led Ottoman force {{attacked}} British yeomanry at Katia, British Empire {{forces in}} the region at first doubled from one brigade to two and then grew <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> the developing infrastructure could support them. The construction of the railway and a water pipeline soon enabled an infantry division to join the light horse and mounted rifle brigades at Romani. During the heat of summer, regular mounted patrols and reconnaissance were carried out from their base at Romani, while the infantry constructed an extensive series of defensive redoubts. On 19 July, the advance of a large German, Austrian and Ottoman force across the northern Sinai was reported. From 20 July until the battle began, the Australian 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades took turns pushing out to clash with the advancing hostile column.|$|E
5|$|In the west, outnumbered and under-equipped US forces—committed in {{piecemeal}} fashion <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> {{they could}} be deployed—were repeatedly defeated and pushed south. The 24th Division, the first US division committed, took heavy losses {{in the battle for}} Taejon in mid-July, which they were driven from after heavy fighting. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving open routes to Pusan. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the North Korean force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

5|$|Operation Sana, {{as well as}} Operation Maestral 2, {{were crucial}} in {{applying}} pressure on the VRS in the final weeks of the Bosnian War. A Central Intelligence Agency analysis comparing the effects of Operation Deliberate Force, Sana and Maestral 2 on the VRS noted that the NATO campaign did not degrade the combat capability of the VRS as much as was initially assumed, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units, rather they targeted the command and control infrastructure of the Bosnian Serb military. The analysis concluded that, while NATO degraded {{the capabilities of the}} VRS, the final HV, HVO and ARBiH offensives inflicted the most damage. It further noted that those offensives, rather than the NATO bombing, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table and ending the war. Author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV, HVO and ARBiH would not have advanced <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> they did had NATO not intervened and denied the VRS its long-range communications.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its albedo. Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (albedo) can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the albedo is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its albedo and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in albedo but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request {{the assistance of}} the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesars crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a flag of truce in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{trading post}} on Corpus Christi Bay was {{established}} by Henry Kinney in 1838 in present-day Corpus Christi. By the 1840s, the area developed into a settlement named after the bay, and a deepwater port {{was established in the}} 1870s. A bayfront that included a 32-foot overlooking statue of Jesus Christ was designed by Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum in 1928, but was turned down by the city in 1930. Later efforts to build a statue on the shore were also rejected. The bayside port would later grow into a major city, and had a population of 277,454 people during the 2000 U.S. census. In addition to Corpus Christi, Kinney also found Nuecestown (known to settlers as The Motts) in 1852, near the confluence of the Nueces River and Nueces Bay. The town was attacked by Mexican robbers in 1875, and underwent a steep decline. It is now a ghost town located in the Corpus Christi city limits. The city of Ingleside was founded on the northern shore of the bay in 1854, and grew slowly. It had a population of 9,388 in the 2000 census. Likewise, the city of Portland located on the northeastern bluff between the Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays, did not grow <b>as</b> <b>rapidly</b> <b>as</b> Corpus Christi, following its 1891 founding. During the 2000 census, it had 14,827 residents.|$|E
