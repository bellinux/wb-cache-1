5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly as <b>a</b> <b>soldier</b> <b>in</b> the Army of Flanders and {{had succeeded in}} 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; {{this led to a}} panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale.
