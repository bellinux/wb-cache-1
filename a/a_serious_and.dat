5|$|These early knives {{sold for}} between $800 and $2,000 each; that, {{combined}} with his appearances at knife shows and write-ups in knife magazines, helped Emerson gain status and {{credibility as a}} custom knifemaker. Once established as <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> reputable maker, Emerson was soon able to concentrate on making the knives he wanted to make—knives designed for use as opposed to show, specifically folding-knives designed for combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{work for}} which Traherne {{is best known}} today is the Centuries of Meditations, a {{collection}} of short paragraphs in which he reflects on Christian life and ministry, philosophy, happiness, desire and childhood. This was first published in 1908 after having been rediscovered in manuscript ten years earlier. His poetry likewise was first published in 1903 and 1910 (The Poetical Works of Thomas Traherne, B.D. and Poems of Felicity). His prose works include Roman Forgeries (1673), Christian Ethics (1675), and <b>A</b> <b>Serious</b> <b>and</b> Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699).|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> {{thoughtful}} child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E

5|$|Traherne was an inconsequential {{literary}} figure {{during his}} lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and {{did not participate in}} literary circles. Only one of his works, Roman Forgeries (1673), was published in his lifetime. Christian Ethicks (1675) followed soon after his death, and later <b>A</b> <b>Serious</b> <b>and</b> Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699), which was published as the work of an anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher. From 1699 until the re-emergence of his work with Bertram Dobell's editions in 1903, Traherne's work fell into obscurity. If not for the chance discovery of an anonymous manuscript, his work and reputation might have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

25|$|On May 5, 1824 he {{was named}} the first bishop of San Salvador by the local civil {{authorities}} and not by the Catholic Church.

25|$|Death {{certificates}} {{show the}} number of zopiclone-related deaths is on the rise.

25|$|As {{minstrel}} shows shifted {{towards the}} development of vaudeville theatre, the comedic and misogynistic “wench” also experienced a shift into more of <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> creative character, the “prima donna.” By {{the end of the}} Prohibition Era, vaudeville shows featured female impersonators as a regular part of their performance, in which further became a new popular trend of public entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Sima Fang {{was known}} for being <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> solemn man {{throughout}} his life; he was humourless even in informal settings such as banquets.

25|$|According to Suetonius, Britannicus {{was good}} friends with the future Emperor Titus, whose father Vespasian had {{commanded}} legions in Britain.

He even claimed to have tasted the poison, which resulted in <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> long illness.

25|$|The Seahawks would {{struggle}} {{for much of}} the year. They would lose their next two games against the Cincinnati Bengals and the Carolina Panthers, blowing leads of 17 and 9 points against each opponent. Two straight wins against the 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys followed, although the Cowboys game was marred by <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> eventually career-ending neck injury to Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette. A loss to the division-leading Cardinals followed, after which was another win against the 49ers which was highlighted by rookie running back Thomas Rawls piling up 209 rushing yards in relief for an ailing Marshawn Lynch, who would be sidelined for several games with a back injury.|$|E
25|$|Around 212, Liu Bei led an army west into Yi Province (益州; {{covering}} present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) {{to assist}} the provincial governor Liu Zhang in countering a rival warlord, Zhang Lu of Hanzhong Commandery. Zhao Yun was appointed as a Major (司馬) of the reserve camp and he remained behind to guard Jing Province. Sometime in 209, Liu Bei married Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun, to strengthen the alliance between him and Sun. Lady Sun also remained in Jing Province when Liu Bei left. Because of her brother's strong influence, Lady Sun was arrogant and she often allowed her close aides to behave lawlessly too. Liu Bei knew that Zhao Yun was <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> <b>and</b> orderly person, so he put Zhao in charge of internal affairs in Jing Province when he was away. When Sun Quan heard that Liu Bei had left for Yi Province, he sent a vessel to fetch his sister back to Jiangdong. Lady Sun attempted to bring Liu Bei's son Liu Shan along with her, but Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei led their men to stop her and retrieved Liu Shan.|$|E
