However, he tore the peroneal longus tendon in his foot at the 2012 Sugar Bowl, and he had surgery on January 13. As a result, he was only {{able to participate in}} one Combine event. His 41 reps in the bench press ranked first among offensive linemen and second <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> combine, behind only nose tackle Dontari Poe. Molk's total was most by a center and ranks third among offensive lineman since 2000, behind only Mitch Petrus and Scott Young, who were both offensive guards.|$|E

It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} and media sources expressed {{concern over the}} Qatari involvement. Because Qatari Diar was a major stake owner, it practiced heavy say in the various tenants and uses permitted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> development, and the project was required {{to adhere to the}} restrictions of Sharia in finance which requires no interest be charged and as such Qatar invested equity only and did not provide a loan. There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a wine bar (or similar business) as a tenant. The Hines-Archstone group also stated that restaurants would be able to serve liquor, but {{that it would not be}} seeking tenants such as liquor stores whose primary business was the sale of alcohol. Automated teller machines would also be permitted, and the agreement between Hines-Archstone and Qatari Diar did not bar a bank as a tenant in the future.|$|E

Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|In the Massachusetts Senate elections, 2004 and Massachusetts House election, 2004, Romney campaigned {{heavily to}} try to recruit Republican {{candidates}} to contest seats, coming up with 131 such candidates, an unusually large number for the weak Massachusetts Republican party to field. [...] Overseeing a $3 million fund-raising effort {{for what he called}} Team Reform, he financed radio and television convincement campaigns on issues such as tuition for children of illegal immigrants. [...] However, his efforts were for naught. Republicans lost two seats in the state House and one seat in the state Senate, and the Democrats who had supported some of Romney's measures but were nonetheless still targeted took personal offense <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> effort. Romney subsequently made a conscious decision to focus less on the state Republican Party and more on bipartisanship at the state level and his own interests at the national level.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884 Charles H. Dow began {{tracking}} stocks, initially {{beginning with}} 11 stocks, mostly railroads, {{and looked at}} average prices for these eleven.

He added up prices, and divided {{by the number of}} stocks to get his Dow Jones average. Dow's numbers were a [...] "convenient benchmark" [...] for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> stock market. In 1889 the original stock report, Customers' Afternoon Letter, became The Wall Street Journal. Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City. After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks. A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.|$|E
2500|$|Holism is {{the view}} that {{emphasizes}} higher-level processes, also called emergent properties: phenomena at a larger level that occur due to the pattern of interactions between {{the elements of a}} system over time. [...] For example, to explain why one species of finch survives a drought while others die out, the holistic method looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> ecosystem. Reducing an ecosystem to its parts in this case would be less effective at explaining overall behavior (in this case, the decrease in biodiversity). As individual organisms must be understood {{in the context of their}} ecosystems, holists argue, so must lower-level biological processes be understood in the broader context of the living organism in which they take part. Proponents of this view cite our growing understanding of the multidirectional and multilayered nature of gene modulation (including epigenetic changes) as an area where a reductionist view is inadequate for full explanatory power.

2500|$|Authors Donald Freed and Raymond Briggs {{claimed in}} Killing Time (1996), their {{book about the}} Simpson case, that an unnamed source told them that while Nigg had lived in Colorado, {{he was known to}} law {{enforcement}} there to be [...] "involved in the narcotics culture" [...] in Aspen (where another branch of Mezzaluna is located) and Denver. According to journalist Joseph Bosco, who had a reserved seat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> trial, Nigg [...] "lived beyond his apparent means", driving a Mercedes and living in a luxury condominium while ostensibly deriving most of his income from waiting tables and occasional low-level acting jobs. Freed and Briggs, among others, have also observed that the circumstances of the killing seem to suggest the assailants' true intent was to kill Nigg rather than rob him. Moreover, Nigg and Goldman were not the only Mezzaluna waiters who had fallen victim to foul play around that time: two others were missing, and a third had his car destroyed by fire in Corona del Mar during 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Studies of {{autosomal}} DNA, which look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> DNA mixture, {{show that}} Jewish populations {{have tended to}} form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry and up to 75% Levantine genes. For populations of the Jewish diaspora, the genetic composition of Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Mizrahi Jewish populations show a significant amounts of shared Middle Eastern ancestry. According to Behar and colleagues (2010), this is [...] "consistent with the historical formulation theories the Jewish people as descending from ancient Hebrew and Israelites of the Levant" [...] and [...] "the dispersion {{of the people of}} ancient Israel throughout the Old World" [...] Jews living in the North African, Italian, and Iberian regions show variable frequencies of admixture with the historical non-Jewish host population along the maternal lines. In the case of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews (in particular Moroccan Jews), who are closely related, the source of non-Jewish admixture is mainly southern European. Behar and colleagues have remarked on an especially close relationship between Ashkenazi Jews and modern Italians, particularly Tuscans.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in command {{of most of the}} western armies. Grant understood the concept of total war and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would end the war. This was total war not in killing civilians but rather in taking provisions and forage and destroying homes, farms, and railroads, that Grant said [...] "would otherwise have gone to the support of secession and rebellion. This policy I believe exercised a material influence in hastening the end." [...] Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Confederacy from multiple directions. Generals George Meade and Benjamin Butler were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond, General Franz Sigel (and later Philip Sheridan) were to attack the Shenandoah Valley, General Sherman was to capture Atlanta and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean), Generals George Crook and William W.
