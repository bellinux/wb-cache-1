40|$|This paper gives a {{tutorial}} overview on {{high speed}} burst-mode receiver (BM-RX) requirements, specific for time division multiplexing passive optical networks, and design issues of such BM-RXs {{as well as their}} advanced design techniques. It focuses on how to design BM-RXs with short burst overhead for fast synchronization. We present design principles and circuit architectures of various types of burst-mode transimpedance amplifiers, burst-mode limiting amplifiers and burst-mode clock and data recovery circuits. The recent development of 10 Gb/s BM-RXs is highlighted also including dual-rate operation for coexistence with deployed PONs and on-chip <b>auto</b> <b>reset</b> generation to eliminate external timing-critical control signals provided by a PON medium access control. Finally sub-system integration and state-of-the-art system performance for 10 Gb/s PONs are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The mono-stereo {{controller}} using {{audio mute}} clock is {{used at the}} International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) FM 106. 6 MHz transmitter in Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia since 2010. The major problem of the FM broadcast station was from the frozen Programmable Logic Controller, PLC, which must be manually reset and the report by the VOA listeners. Then, the PLC <b>auto</b> power <b>reset</b> circuit is proposed and built in mono-stereo controller to monitor {{the operation of the}} PLC. The circuit is also used to restart the PLC whenever, it is frozen. The cloud router and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to Recommended Standard number 232 (RS- 232) converter are used to synchronize the PLC time. From the results, this circuit can improve the transmitter availability and quality of the 24 hours/day broadcast program without affection to the listeners. The reliability of the cloud router is acceptable with low delay of data transfer via the internet connection between Thailand to Mongolia. The cloud router which the IBB leases cloud service from the provider that offers high speed internet up to 1000 Mb/s, via the remote terminal is used for the schedule program and the time synchronization of the PLC correctly. The proposed system is very stable and there is no problem of the frozen PLC whether it connects to the internet or not. Hence, the designed PLC <b>auto</b> power <b>reset</b> circuit can be used to eliminate the frozen PLC problem...|$|R
