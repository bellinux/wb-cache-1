To assess the role of phosphorylation in desensitization, membranes from isoprenaline- and dibutyryl cyclic AMP-desensitized turkey erythrocytes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at 37 degrees C, pH 8. 0. In both preparations <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>treatment</b> significantly decreased desensitization of agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 40 - 75 % (P less than 0. 05). Similar results were obtained after <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>treatment</b> of membranes from isoprenaline- and dibutyryl cyclic AMP-desensitized duck erythrocytes. Moreover, <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>treatment</b> of membranes from duck erythrocytes desensitized with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate returned agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to near control values. In all experiments, inclusion of 20 mM-sodium phosphate to inhibit <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase during <b>treatment</b> of membranes attenuated the enzyme's effect on agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>treatment</b> of membranes from control and isoprenaline-desensitized turkey erythrocytes increased the mobility of beta-adrenergic-receptor proteins, specifically photoaffinity-labelled with [125 I]iodocyanopindolol-diazirine, on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The increased mobility of the beta-adrenergic-receptor proteins after <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase <b>treatment</b> of membranes was again inhibited by 20 mM-phosphate.

50|$|There {{are mainly}} {{three types of}} methods to {{remediate}} hexavalent chromium in ground water and drinking water: 1) reduction of toxicity, 2) removal technologies and 3) containment technologies. Reduction of toxicity of hexavalent chromium involves methods using chemicals, microbes and plants. Some removal technologies include transporting contaminated soil offsite to a landfill, using ion exchange resins to reduce chromium(VI) concentrations to less than detectable limit and granular activated carbon(GAC) filter. Containment technologies can be employed {{with the use of}} physical barriers such as grouts, slurries or sheet piling. Attempts have been made to test the removal or reduction of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions and environment. For example, a research study conducted by the School of Industrial Technology, University Sains Malaysia in 2010 found that chitosan coated with poly 3-methyl thiophene can be effectively employed for removal of hexavalent chromium ions from aqueous solutions. Chitosan is a very cheap, economical, and environmentally friendly substrate for coating of this polymer. Adsorption of chromium(VI) is found to be effective in the lower pH range and at higher temperatures and subsequent desorption is readily achieved upon <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> of the adsorbent. Another study done by the American Industrial Hygiene Association indicates that the airborne hexavalent chromium in acidic mists of an electroplating tank collected on PVC filters was reduced over time after mist generation.|$|E

40|$|It was {{revealed}} from the crystal structure analysis of S-ovalbumin (S-OVA) formed by <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> that Ser 164, Ser 236, and Ser 320 take the d-amino acid residue configuration (Yamasaki et al., J Biol Chem 2003; 278 : 35524 – 35530). To address {{the implications of}} a d-configuration for these Ser residues in S-OVA formation, three mutant OVAs (S 164 A, S 236 A, and S 320 A) were generated to compare their thermostabilities before and after <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment.</b> Following <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment,</b> S 236 A showed a marked increase in melting temperature similar to the wild type (ΔTm, + 9 °C) which corresponded {{to the formation of}} S-OVA, whereas the increment in Tm for both S 164 A and S 320 A was only 4. 5 °C. Furthermore, the Tm value of the double mutant S 164 / 320 A remained unchanged after <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment,</b> supporting the relevance of Ser 164 and Ser 320 for thermostabilization of OVA. As Arg 142 was predicted to interact with D-Ser 164 upon S-OVA formation, it was substituted to Ala to generate R 142 A. The resulting increment in Tm of mutant R 142 A after <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> was 5. 8 °C. The double mutant R 142 /S 320 A was therefore prepared to eliminate the participation of Ser 320 in thermostabilization, and its Tm value was compared before and after <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment.</b> As expected, the increase in Tm for the double mutant was only 1. 2 °C. Taken together, the data suggest that d-configuration of Ser 164 caused by <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> favors interaction with Arg 142 through conformational changes of the side chain.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work reports hygroscopic, thermal, and {{mechanical}} properties of biomass composites comprising sisal fiber reinforcing castor oil PU resin. The effects of reinforcement geometry and <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> of fibers were evaluated.

On the other hand, an adverse effect of <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatment</b> {{was observed in}} the mechanical behavior of the composite with bidirectional fabric architecture. The outstanding influence of moisture on thermo-mechanical properties of biomass composites was confirmed through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry techniques. Dynamical-mechanical thermal analysis showed increased storage modulus (i. e., stiffness) and decreased damping properties of biomass composites as compared to neat PUmatrix.

40|$|Incubation of a {{membrane}} preparation {{enriched in}} Photosystem Two (PSII) at alkaline pH inhibited the water-splitting reactions in two distinct steps. Up to pH 8. 5 the inhibition was reversible, whereas at higher alkalinities it was irreversible.

However, after mild <b>alkaline</b> <b>treatments</b> a partial recovery was possible without the binding of the 23 kDa polypeptide when the assay was at the optimal pH of 6. 5 and in a medium containing excess Cl-. The irreversible phase {{was found to be}} closely linked with the removal of the 33 kDa extrinsic protein of PSII. Treatments with pH values above 8. 5 not only caused the 33 kDa protein to be displaced from the PSII-enriched membranes, but also resulted in an irreversible modification of the binding sites such that the extrinsic 33 kDa protein could not reassociate with PSII when the pH was lowered to 6. 5. The results obtained with these more extreme <b>alkaline</b> pH <b>treatments</b> support the notion that the 23 kDa protein cannot bind to PSII unless the 33 kDa protein is already bound. The differential effect of pH on the removal of the 23 kDa and 33 kDa proteins contrasted with the data of Kuwabara & Murata [(1983) Plant Cell Physiol. 24, 741 - 747], but this discrepancy was accounted for by the use of glycerol in the incubation media...|$|R
