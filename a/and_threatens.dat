40|$|Definitions and {{categories}} of classification for endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> vascular plants, {{as determined by}} the N. C.

The definition and classification of endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species is the heart of any successful effort in conservation and protection. Ev- eryone interested in endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species has probably been frustrated by plans, programs, definitions and lists which often complicate the situation rather than improve it. We of the North Carolina En- dangered <b>and</b> <b>Threatened</b> Plant Committee (The listed {{at the end of this}} paper.) have felt this same frustration.

40|$|The native {{vegetation}} remnants in {{the agricultural}} country of subhumid Tasmania are important strongholds for regionally and globally rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species. A detailed survey of the best 100 of these remnants {{indicated that there was}} no relationship between the size, age and juxtaposition of the remnants and an index of rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species, either in the data set as a whole or in phytosociologically defined subsets. Rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species were found in remnants of widely varying integrity, as indicated by native and exotic species richness and cover. Some species were only found in remnants that were of poor integrity. Efforts to preserve vegetation remnants need to be directed towards both those that are representative and of high integrity, and those that contain rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species.

5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square <b>and</b> <b>threatens</b> the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, <b>and</b> <b>threatens</b> to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 <b>and</b> <b>threatens</b> to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
