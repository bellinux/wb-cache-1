40|$|The {{intent of}} this guide {{is to set}} {{expectations}} about the content and {{the context of the}} exam and to help candidates prepare for the exam. In this guide, you will find recommended Compaq training courses, reference and study material to help you achieve a successful passing score. Studies conducted by Compaq and Prometric show that a combination of course attendance and self-study maximizes the likelihood of passing the exam on the first attempt. What is a beta exam? A beta exam allows us to test the integrity of the exam before we release it. After beta candidates take the exam, we analyze the results and comments to establish the passing score and improve the exam content, questions, instructions, administration procedures, and so forth. Benefits to you If you pass the beta exam, your score is valid and you do not need to take {{the final version of the}} exam. Passing this exam meets one of the elective requirements for obtaining the Accredited Systems Engineer (ASE) Level 2 certification under the NonStop ™ Himalaya Systems track of the Compaq Accredited Professional Program. Also, this beta exam is an elective for the Operating System certification for the NonStop ™ Kernel Systems Engineer designation. If you are thinking about taking the exam in the near future, you may want to take the beta exam now to review and become familiar with its content. During the beta exam, you see all the questions in the exam pool. In the final exam, you see only selected questions from the pool. If you do not pass the beta exam, you can become familiar with the <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are skilled and the <b>areas</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> need work. You then have a better chance of passing the exam the next time. Additionally, you will receive a voucher to retake the exam at a later date for free...|$|R
