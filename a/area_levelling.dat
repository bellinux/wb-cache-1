40|$|Forest {{inventories}} require {{estimates and}} measures of uncertainty for subpopulations such as management units. These units often times hold a small sample size, so they {{should be regarded as}} small areas. When auxiliary information is available, different small area estimation methods have been proposed to obtain reliable estimates for small <b>areas.</b> Unit <b>level</b> empirical best linear unbiased predictors (EBLUP) based on plot or grid unit level models have been studied more thoroughly than <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs, where the modelling occurs at the management unit scale. <b>Area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs do not require a precise plot positioning and allow the use of variable radius plots, thus reducing fieldwork costs. However, their performance has not been examined thoroughly. We compared unit <b>level</b> and <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs, using LiDAR auxiliary information collected for inventorying 98, 104 ha coastal coniferous forest. Unit level models were consistently more accurate than <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs, and <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs were consistently more accurate than field estimates except for large management units that held a large sample. For stand density, volume, basal area, quadratic mean diameter, mean height and Lorey's height, root mean squared errors (rmses) of estimates obtained using <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs were, on average, 1. 43, 2. 83, 2. 09, 1. 40, 1. 32 and 1. 64 times larger than those based on unit level estimates, respectively. Similarly, direct field estimates had rmses that were, on average, 1. 37, 1. 45, 1. 17, 1. 17, 1. 26, and 1. 38 times larger than rmses of <b>area</b> <b>level</b> EBLUPs. Therefore, <b>area</b> <b>level</b> models can lead to substantial gains in accuracy compared to direct estimates, and unit level models lead to very important gains in accuracy compared to <b>area</b> <b>level</b> models, potentially justifying the additional costs of obtaining accurate field plot coordinates...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Extraction Metallurgy) The {{discovery}} of gold at Langlaagte in 1886 {{led to the}} development of gold mining in the Far West Rand in 1934. When shafts were sunk, water from the dolomites posed a serious threat to mining. Despite cementation that sealed the many fissures, water still found its way into the underground workings. This led to the “uniform” policy of dewatering. The farming communities in the area that were dependent on the ground water had to be considered, as they had lost their livelihood. As the water levels lowered, dolines and sinkholes were formed, posing a serious threat to life and property. When the mines eventually cease to operate, be it due to high working costs, or the declining grade of the ore body, the re-watering of the dolomitic compartments will occur as a natural consequence. When water comes to within six metres of the original water level, ground instability, the formation of dolines and sinkholes, both new and existing, will occur, threatening the important rail link between Pretoria and Cape Town as it passes through Far West Rand, as well as the N 12 between Johannesburg and Potchefstroom, as well as the N 14 which lies to the east connecting the Gauteng Province and the North West Province. The dewatering of the compartments caused the soil which formed the roof of the cavities to dry. Re-watering will cause this dry, stable material to become wet and unstable. Where mixtures of slime and/or other material, which is not part of the geological composition of that area was used, the same phenomenon will apply. A further complication is caused by the slimes dams which are unlined. In fact, some of the slime dams were deliberately constructed over cavernous dolomite. This large mass of mine tailings over the dolomitic aquifers will “liquefy”. If the re-watering is not carefully managed the rising water table will undoubtedly trigger a rash of new sinkholes, with catastrophic consequences for unsuspecting communities that may have been established in sensitive areas. The results of previous investigations by the Departments Minerals, Energy and Water Affairs who, due to the loss of institutional memory, might not be able to find the relevant information. Other organizations such as the Council for Geoscience could be using the results for consultancy. The information should be digitized and be available to the broader South African public. FWRDWA is currently in charge of monitoring events in the <b>area.</b> <b>Levelling</b> observations have been carried out quarterly and, so far the movement of ground is minimal. The potential hazard of ground instability will recur with the re-watering of the dolomitic compartments of the Far West Rand. To support what could happen, reference is made to events which took place in the late seventies when the Far West Rand had an above average rainfall. The Donaldson Dam overflowed into the Wonderfontein Spruit and into the dewatered Venterspost compartment. As a result, the water level of the Venterspost Compartment rose rapidly which led to the re-activation of sinkholes and the formation of new ones in the Venterspost area. In the present work levelling has been carried out along most of the loops affected and the results of the levelling give an impression that the surface is currently relatively stable. This Dissertation is presented as an attempt to alert the authorities to the potential dangers if the post mining period is not carefully monitored and insufficient provision made to deal with potential contingencies...|$|E

40|$|This study uses spatial microsimulation {{techniques}} to estimate {{at a small}} <b>area</b> <b>level</b> the impact of housing costs on spatial differences in financial disadvantage, and the actual or potential effect of housing assistance in reducing disadvantage. It is widely acknowledged that substantial spatial differences in economic well-being exist across Australia. There is {{a growing body of}} Australian literature examining aspects of disadvantage at a small <b>area</b> <b>level,</b> and substantial research into the impact of housing costs on financial disadvantage at a national and broad regional level. However, differences in the impact of housing costs on financial disadvantage at a small <b>area</b> <b>level</b> have not been examined to date, due to an absence of adequate data at a sufficiently disaggregated geographical level. This study uses spatial microsimulation {{techniques to}} estimate at a small <b>area</b> <b>level</b> the impact of housing costs on spatial differences in financial disadvantage, and the actual or potential effect of housing assistance in reducing disadvantage. The specific research questions that the project addresses are as follows: * What {{is the nature of the}} relationship between housing assistance, housing costs and financial disadvantage at a small <b>area</b> <b>level?</b> Which regions are affected? Are metropolitan areas more financially disadvantaged because of higher housing costs? * Which types of households are affected by the inclusion of housing costs?

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence, mainly from daily time series studies, linking {{air pollution and}} stroke. Small <b>area</b> <b>level</b> geographical correlation studies offer another means of examining the air pollution–stroke association.

Data on smoking from health surveys may be incorporated in spatial analyses to adjust for potential confounding effects but may be sparse at the small <b>area</b> <b>level.</b> Smoothing, using data from neighbouring areas, {{may be used to}} increase the precision of smoking prevalence estimates for small areas. We examined the effect of modelled outdoor NOx levels on stroke mortality using a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model to incorporate random effects, in order to allow for unmeasured confounders and to acknowledge sampling error in the estimation of smoking prevalence. We observed an association between NOx and stroke mortality after taking into account random effects at the small <b>area</b> <b>level.</b> We found no association between smoking prevalence and stroke mortality at the small <b>area</b> <b>level</b> after modelling took into account imprecision in estimating smoking prevalence.

For all samples shown in Fig. S 4, at a height of about 200  nm, the bearing curve started to increase in the bearing area fraction and approaches a constant bearing <b>area</b> <b>level</b> within several 100  nm. The increase indicated the volume of everything present above the surface, which is the volume of the pillars.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} inequalities in health in paediatric ophthalmology from a health services research perspective and examines some associated methodological issues.

I extend this work by evaluating {{the effect of a}} screening intervention on existing inequalities at one particular clinic. I then explore some methodological issues related to this work. The analyses of amblyopia data are based on an ecological measure of deprivation. Since there are problems in assuming that exposure effects at the <b>area</b> <b>level</b> apply at the individual level, I therefore investigate the relationship between individual and <b>area</b> <b>level</b> deprivation measures.

40|$|Ecological {{influences}} on health outcomes {{are associated with}} the spatial stratification of health. However, the majority of studies that seek to understand these ecological influences utilise aspatial methods. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a spatial statistics tool that expands standard regression by allowing for spatial variance in parameters. This study contributes to the urban health literature, by employing GWR to uncover geographic variation in Limiting Long Term Illness (LLTI) and <b>area</b> <b>level</b> effects at the small <b>area</b> <b>level</b> in a relatively small, urban environment. Using GWR it was found that each of the three contextual covariates, <b>area</b> <b>level</b> deprivation scores, the percentage of the population aged 75 years plus and the percentage of residences of white ethnicity for each LSOA exhibited a non-stationary relationship with LLTI across space. Multicollinearity among the predictor variables was found not to be a problem. Within an international policy context, this research indicates that even at the city level, a “one-size fits all” policy strategy is not the most appropriate approach to address health outcomes.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} variation between small <b>areas</b> in the <b>levels</b> of walking, cycling, jogging, {{and swimming}} and overall {{physical activity and}} the importance of <b>area</b> <b>level</b> socioeconomic disadvantage in predicting physical activity participation. Methods: All census collector districts (CCDs) in the 20 innermost local government areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, were identified and ranked by the percentage of low income households (<$ 400 /week) living in the CCD. Fifty CCDs were randomly selected from the least, middle, and most disadvantaged septiles of the ranked CCDs and 2349 residents (58. 7 % participation rate) participated in a cross sectional postal survey about physical activity. Multilevel logistic regression (adjusted for extrabinomial variation) was used to estimate <b>area</b> <b>level</b> variation in walking, cycling, jogging, and swimming and in overall physical activity participation, {{and the importance of}} <b>area</b> <b>level</b> socioeconomic disadvantage in predicting physical activity participation. Results: There were significant variations between CCDs in all activities and in overall physical participation in age and sex adjusted models; however, after adjustment for individual SES (income, occupation, education) and <b>area</b> <b>level</b> socioeconomic disadvantage, significant differences remained only for walking (p = 0. 004), cycling (p = 0. 003), and swimming (p = 0. 024). Living in the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas was associated with a decreased likelihood of jogging and of having overall physical activity levels that were sufficiently active for health; these effects remained after adjustment for individual socioeconomic status (sufficiently active: OR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 0. 90 and jogging: OR = 0. 69, 95 % CI 0. 51 to 0. 94). Conclusion: These research findings support the need to focus on improving local environments to increase physical activity participation.
