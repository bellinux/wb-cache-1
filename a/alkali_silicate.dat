These findings in the high viscosity range of 108 – 1011  Pa⋅s, where pressure {{appears to be more}} efficient than in low viscous melts at high temperature, are consistent with previous results on the viscosity of polymerized to depolymerized melts in the system NaAlSi 3 O 8 –CaMgSi 2 O 6 by Behrens and Schulze [H.

The elastic modulus of the calcium <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> constituting the reaction rim, which is formed at the interface between <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> and Ca(OH) 2 in a chemically-idealized system of the alkali-silica reaction, was studied using nano-indentation. In addition, the corresponding calcium to silica mole ratio of the calcium <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> was investigated. The results show that the elastic modulus of the calcium <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> formed at the interface increased with the increase of the calcium to silica mole ratio and vice versa. Furthermore, the more calcium that was available for interaction with <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> to form calcium <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate,</b> the higher the calcium to silica mole ratio and, consequently, the higher the elastic modulus of the formed calcium <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate.</b> This work provides illustrative evidence from a mechanical point of view on how the occurrence of cracks due to the alkali-silica reaction (ASR) is linked to the formation of the reaction rim.

It is proposed that the mechanisms determining the distribution of bridging and non-bridging oxygen atoms at the glass transition are the same as those that promote ionic transport at lower temperatures in the glass. In particular the results of XAFS and MASNMR can be used to predict the activation energy for ionic transport and the magnitude of the electrical conductivity.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used bed {{material}} in the existing fluidized bed systems is silica sand. Upon burning fuels with high alkali content, such as biomass, in a bed of silica sand, <b>alkali</b> <b>silicates</b> are formed as molten glassy phase that easily stick and form agglomerates, defluidization of the reactor and unplanned operational stops. Several materials have been tested as alternative bed materials, often containing aluminate minerals. Due to the relatively high cost of such bed materials the most dominant practice is still the use of silica sand even with high alkali fuels and the bed sintering is controlled by continuous replacement of the bed material. The present study investigates the possibility of mixing bed materials and thereby optimizing the existing process by combining the low cost of silica sand with the sintering inhibiting properties of bauxite. Silica sand and bauxite were mixed in different ratios {{in a series of}} tests and were exposed to alkali compounds in a 12 MW boiler as well as in simplified experiments in a lab-scale furnace. The performance of the mixture of bed materials was then evaluated based on the tendency to chemically interact with the alkali compounds, the formation of agglomerates and the effect on the overall performance of the reactor. Thermodynamic predictions of the expected compounds at the given conditions were also used to compare with the experimentally obtained results. It was observed that mixing bed materials led to change in the observed mechanism of agglomeration and is beneficial for the fluidization. Furthermore, when calcium was present the amount of the formed <b>alkali</b> <b>silicates</b> and thereby the amount of agglomerates was decreased. It could be therewith shown that a significant improvement can be reached with existing bed materials...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, as the {{silicate}} {{concentration in}} aqueous fluids increases and silicate species becomes more polymerized with pressure and temperature, the types and abundance Qn species more closely resemble those in hydrous silicate melts (Zotov and Keppler 1998; Cody et al. 2005; Mysen 2010). This structural evolution {{may lead to}} complete miscibility between silicate and aqueous fluid. It is likely that complete miscibility between fluid and melt occurs at lower pressure in <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> systems than in those of alkaline earth silicate systems because of the greater silicate solubility in <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> fluids. This conclusion accords with experimental observations that show complete miscibility near 1 – 1.5  GPa in <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> and aluminosilicate systems, whereas pressure exceeds 3  GPa before reaching miscibility in alkaline earth systems (Bureau and Keppler 1999; Stalder et al. 2001; Mibe et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to synthesise zeolites and aluminosilicate materials from silicon sources derived from biomass ashes. These materials will have great potential as catalysts and adsorbents. In order to begin this study {{it was necessary to}} find and optimise a technique for extraction of silicon to an <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> solution from biomass ashes. It was then necessary to develop a technique for analysis of the <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> solutions. This was done using calibration of integrals from infrared spectra. An optimisation of the synthesis of Zeolite X from a rice hull ash derived <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> was developed and these materials were analysed and characterised using XRD, N 2 Adsorption porosimetry, X‐Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy, and X‐Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. An in‐depth study of the surface of the ash derived and reference Zeolite X was undertaken using in situ small molecule probing FT‐IR. It was found that although the materials were similar {{there was a significant difference}} due to the presence of a strongly bonded carbonate species in the pores of the bio‐derived zeolite. Synthesis of a Miscanthus ash derived mesoporous silica, MCM‐ 41, was successfully achieved which was comparable to its conventionally synthesised equivalent. Both displayed ordered hexagonal pores and high surface areas. A study on addition of different sources of aluminium found that it was possible to introduce aluminium into the structure successfully. Included in this study was the addition of the waste product ‘red clay’ as an aluminium source. Another mesoporous silica, SBA‐ 15 was synthesised from a Miscanthus ash derived <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate.</b> It was necessary to optimise the synthesis to adapt to the different pH systems of the conventional method and bio‐derived <b>alkali</b> <b>silicate</b> solutions.

A syneresis phenomenon during ripening that leads to the formation of a strongly consolidated solid has been observed. Whatever the cation, the gelation or syneresis mechanism would be similar. However, gelation time decreases and syneresis increases with the cation size.
