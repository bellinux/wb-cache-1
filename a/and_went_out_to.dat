5|$|Built at Frindsbury, near Rochester in Kent, Bellerophon was {{initially}} laid up in ordinary, briefly being commissioned during the Spanish and Russian Armaments. She entered service with the Channel Fleet on {{the outbreak of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Glorious First of June in 1794, the first of several fleet actions of the wars. Bellerophon narrowly escaped being captured by the French in 1795, when her squadron was nearly overrun by a powerful French fleet, but the bold actions of the squadron's commander, Vice-Admiral Sir William Cornwallis, caused the French to retreat. She played a minor role in efforts to intercept a French invasion force bound for Ireland in 1797, and then joined the Mediterranean Fleet under Sir John Jervis. Detached to reinforce Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson's fleet in 1798, she took part in the decisive defeat of a French fleet at the Battle of the Nile. She then returned to England <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the West Indies, where she spent the Peace of Amiens on cruises and convoy escort duty between the Caribbean and North America.|$|E

25|$|After the {{successful}} capture of Basra in September 871, 'Ali ibn Aban was again dispatched to Jubba {{to fight against}} Mansur ibn Ja'far al-Khayyat, the military administrator of Basra and the Tigris districts. To reinforce 'Ali, the Zanj leader sent twelve barges laden with troops {{under the command of}} Abu al-Layth al-Isbahani, with orders to follow 'Ali's commands. Abu al-Layth, however, decided to attack Mansur on his own <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> meet him without consulting 'Ali. In the resulting battle, Mansur defeated Abu al-Layth, killing many of his men and capturing his barges.|$|E

The Nichols and White Plains areas were the first to be {{cultivated}} and settled within the present-day bounds of Trumbull, due to the fertile soil, spring-fed ponds and natural meadows found there and their proximity to the main village located less than three miles away. In the mid-seventeenth century in the Colony of Connecticut, it was very common for freemen to establish a farm or several farms in the fertile upland or countryside while maintaining a substantial townhouse in the village or even back in England.|$|E

25|$|Hawker was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant in 1796, {{at the age}} of thirteen, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the West Indies with his brother-in-law, Captain Charles Boyles, and served on several of his ships. He later served as a lieutenant aboard HMS Garland, and aboard the 18-gun sloop , under the command of another brother-in-law, Michael Seymour. Hawker's ships were active in operations against French and Spanish privateers and merchants, and he assisted in the capture of two large privateers. He then became first-lieutenant of the 32-gun , and commanded her boats in a successful cutting-out expedition against a Spanish privateer. Hawker then left active service for a period on half-pay during the Peace of Amiens.|$|E

The {{following}} year the seeds were planted for the city's recovery when Tom Flynn, a former resident trying to sell some of his mining claims, showed pictures of them to Billy Fiske, a U.S. Olympic bobsledder who had competed at the Winter Olympics earlier that year. He saw perfect terrain for a ski resort, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Aspen and bought some land. Over that winter the newly formed Highland Bavarian ski club built its first ski near Ashcroft.

25|$|In August 1858 news reached Douglas {{that two}} Vancouver Island miners {{had been killed}} by natives. He {{believed}} that the whole region {{was on the verge of}} war <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> investigate. Numerous minor clashes between natives and whites had concluded without fatalities. After investigating the situation he found that alcohol had been a major cause, and prohibited the sale of liquor to natives. While on the trip to the murder scene, Douglas brought the Crown Solicitor of Vancouver Island in order to uphold the law and make a show that demonstrated British law was still in effect. During this trip he encountered a great number of squatting foreigners, reducing the total possible revenues for land sales to the government.|$|E

Sharlene was looked after by the hostel staff until she was placed in the care of the Social Services. Back at the UDA club, Cowan removed the bloodstained hood and saw by her appalling head wounds and badly-bruised, disfigured face that Ann Ogilby was obviously dead; the body was then wrapped up in a brown sack and carried downstairs. The killers went to have a drink with Elizabeth Douglas to whom they recounted the details of the fatal beating as she had remained on the ground floor the entire time. Afterwards, Cowan and Smith got dressed up <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the disco as planned.|$|E
25|$|In 219, when Cao Cao's general Cao Ren {{was being}} besieged at Fan (樊; or Fancheng, in present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei) by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu, Cao Cao was {{away at the}} Hanzhong Campaign so he ordered his generals to lead troops from their {{respective}} garrisons to reinforce Cao Ren. Around the time, Sun Quan had pledged allegiance to Cao Cao, so Zhang Liao was able to lead his forces from Juchao to help Cao Ren. However, before Zhang Liao reached Fan, Cao Cao's general Xu Huang had already defeated Guan Yu and lifted the siege on Fan. Zhang Liao rendezvoused with Cao Cao, who had returned after being defeated in the Hanzhong Campaign, at Mobei (摩陂; in present-day Jia County, Hebei). Cao Cao rode in a carriage <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> personally receive Zhang Liao.

25|$|As Beaulieu {{tried to}} retreat east beyond the Adda River, {{he found that}} the French were already across the southern-most roads. Hoping to cut his way through in the morning, the Austrian {{commander}} sent Schübirz toward Codogno with two battalions of the Reisky Infantry Regiment Nr. 13 and four squadrons of Uhlans, about 1,000 foot soldiers and 580 cavalrymen. Arriving at Codogno in the dark, Schübirz decided on his own initiative to capture the place. At around 10:00 PM, his troops routed the French pickets and infiltrated much of the town. Soon, Laharpe and his staff received reports of the Austrian incursion <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> find out what was going on. It so happened that the French 51st Line Infantry Demi-Brigade was marching through the center of town. As the troops reached the town square, they were ambushed by soldiers of the Reisky Regiment and soon both sides were firing blindly into the darkness. After the French rounded up a number of Austrian prisoners, they found Laharpe shot dead, possibly by friendly fire.|$|E

25|$|Terpsichore was {{launched}} in 1785, but was not prepared for active service until {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary Wars in 1793. She was initially sent to serve in the West Indies where in 1794 Captain Richard Bowen took command. Bowen commanded Terpsichore until his death in 1797, and several of her most memorable exploits occurred during his captaincy. Terpsichore served mostly in the Mediterranean, capturing three frigates, and in 1797 went as far as to attack the damaged Spanish first rate Santísima Trinidad, as she limped away from the Battle of Cape St Vincent. The Santísima Trinidad mounted 136 guns to Terpsichores 32, and was the largest warship in the world at time. Terpsichore inflicted several casualties, before abandoning the attack. Terpsichore passed through several commanders after Bowen's death at Tenerife, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the East Indies, where her last commander was Captain William Augustus Montagu. Montagu fought an action with a large French frigate in 1808, and though he was able to outfight her, {{he was not able to}} capture her. Terpsichore returned to Britain the following year, and spent the last years of the war laid up in ordinary. She survived in this state until 1830, when she was broken up.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} of Downman's {{activities}} {{during the years of}} peace that followed, until his appearance in February 1789 with the fleet despatched to the East Indies under Commodore William Cornwallis. Cornwallis promoted him to lieutenant while serving in the East Indies on 5 March 1790. He returned to England at the start of 1793. With the commencement of the French Revolutionary Wars, Downman joined the 74-gun [...] <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Mediterranean, where served with Commodore Robert Linzee's squadron. He was present at the occupation of Toulon and assisted in the attack on the tower and redoubt at Fornelli in September 1793. While helping in the reduction of Corsica, Downman cut out a French gunboat from under the guns of a battery at St Fiorenzo, and later led a party of 100 seamen and marines in scaling a cliff to place a gun overlooking the enemy's defences. For these actions he received the thanks of Lieutenant-General David Dundas.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> enjoy the nightlife, {{before returning to the}} studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make it real calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place.

[...] He also cut out her tongue and larynx {{and put them in the}} garbage disposal.
