50|$|Just {{prior to}} its release in early 1985, AppleBus was renamed AppleTalk. The system {{had a number of}} limitations, {{including}} a speed of only 230.4 kbit/s, a maximum distance of 1000 feet from end to end, and only 32 nodes per LAN. But as the basic hardware was built into the Mac, adding nodes only cost about $50 for the <b>adaptor</b> <b>box.</b> In comparison, Ethernet or Token Ring cards cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Additionally, the entire networking stack required only about 6 kB of RAM, allowing it to run on any Mac.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the first USB standard in 1996, was aimed squarely at the sort of roles provided by the game port, but initially had little market impact. The {{introduction of}} the iMac, which was based almost entirely on USB expansion, began a rapid expansion of USB in the market. This led both to new gaming devices using USB, {{as well as the}} profusion of adaptors. For instance, the 1997 Microsoft Precision Pro joystick was re-introduced in a version that used a game port connector, but also included a USB <b>adaptor</b> in the <b>box.</b> The rapid takeover of USB meant that this was superfluous when the Precision Pro 2 was released the next year in 1998. By 2000, game ports were purely for backward compatibility with now outdated devices.|$|R
