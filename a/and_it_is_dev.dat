2500|$|<b>Dev</b> Anand <b>is</b> {{credited}} with giving actors like Zarina Wahab in Ishq Ishq Ishq, Jackie Shroff in Swami Dada, Tabu in Hum Naujawan and Richa Sharma (Sanjay Dutt’s first wife) {{a break in}} the film industry, discovering Zeenat Amaan, Tina Munim and encouraging music composer Rajesh Roshan. Amit Khanna started his career with Navketan as executive producer in 1971 and had <b>been</b> secretary to <b>Dev</b> Anand in the 1970s. He adds, [...] "The uniqueness of Navketan today <b>is</b> that <b>it's</b> the only film company in the world still run by the one who started it." [...] Shatrughan Sinha disclosed in an interview that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Dev</b> Anand who gave him a break in films by giving him a role in [...] "Prem Pujari" [...] and since Dev had given Sinha a very small role in that film, he compensated for it by giving Sinha another role in his next film 'Gambler'. Sinha quoted [...] "Later on we worked together in 'Sharif Badmash' <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really a privilege to work with him". <b>It</b> <b>was</b> under <b>Dev</b> Anand's Navketan Banner where Guru Dutt, Raj Khosla, Waheeda Rehman, S.D. Burman, Jaidev, Sahir Ludhianvi, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Yash Johar, Shekhar Kapur and Kabir Bedi were given breaks into Hindi films and Dev launched actors Zaheera, Zaheeda Hussain, Zarina Wahab, Natasha Sinha, Ekta Sohini and Sabrina.|$|R

50|$|Like in Nau Do Gyarah, {{where he}} {{stationed}} {{a major portion}} of the film in the hill station of Mahabaleshwar, here Vijay Anand explores the beauty of the South Indian hill station Ooty. Dev Anand kept strolling through gardens of Ooty in the song 'Khoya Khoya Chand' in his trademark swaying motion where he kept swinging his arms all through. It might appear kind off funny today but back then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Dev</b> Anand's patented dancing style which he continued for years to come. The scene immediately after the song was considerably bold by the 60s standards where Waheeda Rehman removes her sari {{to use it as a}} cord to pull Dev Anand up, when he slips down from the cliff.|$|R
5000|$|The song has {{received}} critical acclaim with critics praising Dev & Enrique's vocals {{and also the}} dance-beats.Amy Sciarretto from Pop-Crush gave the song 3.5 stars (out of 5) quoting, [...] "Dev‘s honeyed, cavity-causing voice snakes and slithers around Enrique Iglesias‘ on their sultry duet, ‘Naked.’ The song will have your blood surging through your veins and to your nether regions. It’s a Eurodance-inspired club banger, with thumping backbeats and synths, but the heat generated by the new mom and the Latin pop star? That’s as authentic as it gets. If <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Dev’s</b> <b>and</b> ‘Rique’s intention to get people hot and bothered by their song, starting things off {{on the dance floor}} and finishing them in the bedroom, then mission accomplished. It’s an upbeat, uptempo rump-shaker." [...] Meena Rupani from the Desihits quoted, [...] "Enrique's sultry vocals do well with Dev's ability to talk dirty <b>and</b> make <b>it</b> sound oh so good. The techno elements of the song <b>is</b> what <b>Dev</b> {{has come to be known}} for in her tracks so I'm not surprised she has incorporated that here also. Although, I prefer Dev's other tracks this collaboration was good in theory so I suppose a pat on the back can be given to both singers." ...|$|R

40|$|In his article, 2 ̆ 2 Comparative Literature in India, 2 ̆ 2 Amiya Dev bases his {{discussion}} {{on the fact that}} India has many languages and literatures thus representing an a priori situation and conditions of diversity.

Nonetheless, <b>Dev</b> also observes that to speak of Indian literature in the plural is equally problematic. Such a characterization, he urges, either overlooks or obscures manifest interrelations and affinities. His article compares the unity and the diversity thesis, and identifies the relationship between Indian commonality and differences as the prime site of comparative literature in India. He surveys the current scholarly and intellectual positions on unity and diversity and looks into the post-structuralist doubt of homogenization of differences in the name of unity. Dev also examines the search for common denominators and a possible pattern of togetherness and Dev underlines location and located inter-Indian reception as an aspect of interliterariness. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> t/here <b>Dev</b> perceives Indian literature, that is, not as a fixed or determinate entity but as an ongoing and interliterary process: Indian language and literature ever in the re/making...|$|R

By 1950 he had been gradually established as a premier villain in Hindi cinema. Within a week of Ziddis success, he had signed three more films — S M Yusuf's Grihasti (1948), which became a diamond jubilee hit, Prabhat Films's Apradhi (1949) and Wali Mohammad's Putli (1949).

In the 1940s, romantic duets featuring him, like the songs [...] "Tere Naaz Uthane Ko Jee Chahta Hai" [...] from Grihasti, opposite Shardha, and from Khandaan (1942), with Noor Jehan, became popular in the 1940s. The way he expressed his dialogues in films such as Sheesh Mahal (1950), a series of disguises he made in Adalat (1958), and the rapport he shared with vamps like Kuldip Kaur in Jashan (1955) showcased his versatility in the 1950s.|$|R
