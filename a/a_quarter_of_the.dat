5|$|An FAA {{study in}} 1968 {{had found that}} <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2,230 {{near-miss}} aircraft encounters reported that year had involved a military aircraft. Following the in-flight collision of Flight 706, the FAA and the US Military agreed {{to cut down on}} VFR flights and operate instead under IFR. This transition would require military aircraft to file flight plans and obey civilian air traffic controllers.|$|E

By the mid-2nd century, there were 44 auxiliary regiments stationed there, about 10% of the total auxilia. In Britain there were 60.

5|$|In {{colonies of}} the paper wasp, Polistes chinensis antennalis, workers can lay up to <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male eggs in the colony. The number of eggs that survived to hatching, however, was minimal {{compared}} to the number produced by the queen. Analysis of the microsatellite markers showed that both queens and workers contributed to policing of worker and queen-laid eggs even in monogynous and monandrous colonies.|$|E

5|$|Since the Neolithic Revolution about 47% of the world's forests {{have been}} lost to human use.

5|$|The Scandinavian {{influence}} in Scotland was probably {{at its height}} in the mid eleventh century {{during the time of}} Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man.

5|$|The {{financing}} for rebuilding the downtown core came {{in large part}} from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank owned <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{homes in}} Cihuatlán, Jalisco, were totally destroyed, leaving many homeless. In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 {{percent of all}} homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left out of work. That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E

The rare black-faced impala has been introduced into private farms in Namibia and the Etosha National Park. Population densities vary largely from place to place; from less than one impala per square kilometre in Mkomazi National Park (Tanzania) to as high as 135 per square kilometre near Lake Kariba (Zimbabwe).|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken {{from that of a}} house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population along racial lines and there was very little mixing between the colours.

5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including <b>a</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1913 year), {{with its}} {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came {{at the cost of}} falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success did not improve significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla sent Wilfrid to the Isle of Wight, {{which was}} still pagan, {{with the aim of}} {{converting}} the inhabitants.

In 688, the king relinquished his throne and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony. Wilfrid was probably influential in Cædwalla's decision to be baptised in Rome.|$|E
5|$|During Soviet times, stanitsas, {{no longer}} being Cossack settlements, still {{encompassed}} relatively large populations. In 1926, for example, the populations of five of the sixteen stanitsas then existing exceeded five thousand.
