5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
5|$|Chocolatier was {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Big Splash Games, a trio of video game designers, who remained employees whilst developing a prototype game in their spare time. This prototype was rejected by publishers, but after {{coming up with the}} premise of Chocolatier the team was signed-up by PlayFirst and completed the title. The game received a mostly positive reception: reviewers enjoyed the action mini-game which is played when chocolates <b>are</b> <b>manufactured,</b> and the game's graphics, sound, and Victorian-era presentation.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them}} to stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E

5|$|Because of its low {{atomic number}} and very low {{absorption}} for X-rays, {{the oldest and}} {{still one of the}} most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of synchrotron radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|Tiny {{amounts of}} 210Po are {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} laboratory and for teaching purposes—typically {{of the order of}} , in the form of sealed sources, with the polonium deposited on a substrate or in a resin or polymer matrix—are often exempt from licensing by the NRC and similar authorities as they are not considered hazardous. Small amounts of 210Po <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> for sale to the public in the United States as 'needle sources' for laboratory experimentation, and they are retailed by scientific supply companies. The polonium is a layer of plating which in turn is plated with a material such as gold, which allows the alpha radiation (used in experiments such as cloud chambers) to pass while preventing the polonium from being released and presenting a toxic hazard. According to United Nuclear, they typically sell between four and eight such sources per year.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles <b>are</b> <b>manufactured</b> for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
