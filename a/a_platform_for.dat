5|$|A bypass {{platform}} is provided to these polymerases by Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Under normal circumstances, PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA. At {{a site of}} lesion, PCNA is ubiquitinated, or modified, by the RAD6/RAD18 proteins to provide <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication. After translesion synthesis, extension is required. This extension {{can be carried out}} by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error-free, {{as in the case of}} Pol η, yet if TLS results in a mismatch, a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it; Pol ζ. Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches, whereas more processive polymerases cannot. So when a lesion is encountered, the replication fork will stall, PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion, then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch, and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication.|$|E
5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as <b>a</b> <b>platform</b> <b>for</b> surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E
