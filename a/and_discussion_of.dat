5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} of capitalism <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw}} it as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|After the {{presentation}} <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the many proposals, a governmental commission {{was set up}} on 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> LARP. These {{communities}} {{have developed a}} subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre with the rapid uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|Naturism can {{sometimes}} contain aspects of eroticism, although {{the debate about}} this is often simplified and seen negatively {{in the media and}} the public mind and by many modern naturists and naturist organisations. Historically the experience <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> erotic feelings during naturist activities such as dance and gymnastics played an important part in early Germanic naturism and formed part of its 'positive' connection with nature. However, it was when naturism arrived in the more sexually conservative cultures of the UK and the United States that the expression <b>and</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> eroticism within naturism became frowned upon.|$|E
