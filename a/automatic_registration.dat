2500|$|To some extent, results {{along these}} lines have been {{achieved}} in trials performed around the globe, making use of GPS, mobile phone signals, and vehicle registration plates. [...] GPS is becoming standard in many new high-end vehicles and is an option on most new low- and mid-range vehicles. In addition, many users also have mobile phones which transmit trackable signals (and may also be GPS-enabled). [...] Mobile phones can already be traced for purposes of emergency response. [...] GPS and mobile phone tracking, however, do not provide fully reliable data. Furthermore, integrating mobile phones in vehicles may be prohibitively difficult. Data from mobile phones, though useful, might even increase risks to motorists as they tend {{to look at their}} phones rather than concentrate on their driving. <b>Automatic</b> <b>registration</b> plate recognition can provide high levels of data, but continuously tracking a vehicle through a corridor is a difficult task with existing technology. Today's equipment is designed for data acquisition and functions such as enforcement and tolling, not for returning data to vehicles or motorists for response. GPS will nevertheless be one of the key components in VII systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{a method}} for <b>Automatic</b> Image <b>Registration</b> (AIR) through {{histogram}} is proposed. <b>Automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> {{is one of the}} crucial steps in the analysis of remotely sensed data. A new acquired image must be transformed, using image registration techniques, to match the orientation and scale of previous related images. This new approach combines several segmentations of the pair of images to be registered. A relaxation parameter on the histogram modes delineation is introduced. It is followed by characterization of the extracted objects through the objects area, axis ratio, and perimeter and fractal dimension. The matched objects are used for rotation and translation estimation. It allows for the registration of pairs of images with differences in rotation and translation. This method contributes to subpixel accuracy. Keywords- <b>Automatic</b> Image <b>Registration</b> (AIR), Registration Techniques, Rotation and Translation Estimation I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> {{is still}} an actual {{challenge}} in several fields. Even though many image registration algorithms have been developed over the years, {{it is far from}} the broad use of applications. This paper deals with problem faced in the area of remote sensing consisting of image registration. Generally remote sensing images may have different gray –level characteristics and multiple features, so simple techniques cannot be applied directly. In this work, new <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> through region considered segmentation is proposed. This approach performs region considered segmentation for the pair of images to be registered, followed by features characterization of the extracted objects with control point selection and objects matching. It leads to the registration of satellite images (multisensor and multiband) with differences in rotation and translation. The region considered segmentation for <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> leads to a more sub pixel accuracy.

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> is an {{attractive}} and unresolved problem in the machine vision literature. This paper presents two novel structural constraints, namely proximity and closeness constraints, that improve both the accuracy and robustness of an existing motion consistency based algorithm (GICP) for <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration.</b> It also defines the conditions when such constraints are fired at specific points of the registration of two overlapping range images. The proximity constraint says that neighbouring points should be neighbouring before and after a rigid motion. The closeness constraint implements a local closest point search from the second image to the first image. While the GICP algorithm uses an exhaustive search for the closest points, in this paper, we employ the optimised k–d tree data structure to accelerate the closest point search. A large number of experiments based on real range images demonstrate {{that the combination of}} rigid motion constraints with these novel proximity and closeness constraints leads to a more accurate and robust evaluation of possible correspondences leading, in turn, to more accurate, robust and efficient <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> results...|$|R

40|$|Accurate, robust, and <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> is a {{critical}} task in many typical applications that employ multi-sensor and/or multi-date imagery information. In this paper we present {{a new approach to}} <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration,</b> which obviates the need for feature matching and solves for the registration parameters in a Hough-like approach. The basic idea underpinning GIPSC methodology is to pair each data element belonging to two overlapping images, with all other data in each image, through a mathematical transformation. The results of pairing are encoded and exploited in histogram-like arrays as clusters of votes. Geometrically invariant features are adopted in this approach to reduce the computational complexity generated by the high dimensionality of the mathematical transformation. In this way, the problem of image registration is characterized, not by spatial or radiometric properties, but by the mathematical transformation that describes the geometrical relationship between the two images or more. While this approach does not require feature matching, it does permit recovery of matched features (e. g., points) as a useful by-product. The developed methodology incorporates uncertainty modeling using a least squares solution. Successful and promising experimental results of multi-date <b>automatic</b> image <b>registration</b> are reported in this paper. 1...|$|R
