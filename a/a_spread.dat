5|$|The {{proposed}} {{bond issue}} went ahead in July 2006. Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these bonds is 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – {{one of the main}} sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.|$|E

5|$|Carson and Zobel in 1923 had {{conclusively}} {{shown that}} filtering cannot remove noise {{to the same}} degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of Fourier analysis to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call band-limited white noise. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers in the bullpen during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.|$|E
5|$|Archeological {{evidence}} for {{agriculture in the}} Sangam age has been retrieved from sites such as Mangudi, Kodumanal and Perur, which have yielded charred remains of seeds of crops like rice, millets including pearl millets, pulses and cotton. It has been deduced that agriculture most likely involved dry farming, with additional irrigation for cotton and rice; mixed cropping {{seems to have been}} undertaken to replenish the nitrogen in the soil—this also suggests <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> of labour and knowledge of different sowing and harvesting techniques. The presence of cotton seeds indicates the production of a crop aimed at craft production, which is also attested by finds of cotton and spindle whorls at Kodumanal. Remains of structures that resemble an artificial water reservoir have been located at different sites. In Arikamedu, a few terracotta ring-wells were found {{at the bottom of the}} reservoir; it has been suggested that the ring wells were to assure the supply of water during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, Vogue did <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> called “Grunge & Glory” with fashion {{photographer}} Steven Miesel who shot supermodels Naomi Campbell and Kristen McMenamy in a savanna landscape wearing grunge-styled clothing. This shoot made McMenamy the face for grunge, {{as she had}} her eyebrows shaved and her hair cropped short. Designers like Christian Lacroix, Donna Karen and Karl Lagerfeld incorporated the grunge influence into their looks. In 1993, James Truman, editor of Details, said: “to me the thing about grunge is it’s not anti-fashion, it’s unfashion. Punk was anti-fashion. It made a statement. Grunge is about not making a statement, which is why it’s crazy for it to become a fashion statement.” The unkempt fashion sense defined {{the look of the}} “slacker generation”, who “skipped school, smoked pot... cigarettes and listened to music” hoping to become a rock star one day.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> offense scheme {{implemented}} by first-year head coach Todd Dodge, the Mean Green experienced some offensive success; however, defensive woes {{led to a}} 1–7 record through the first eight games of the season. In a rivalry game against SMU on September 8 Mean Green quarterback Daniel Meager threw for over 600 yards (one of the top 20 single-game performances in FBS history), but defensive errors and an interception returned for a touchdown during the fourth quarter led to another loss. After losing to the Arkansas Razorbacks 66–7, Dodge replaced Meager with redshirt freshman Giovanni Vizza. After four games as a starter, Vizza had set a new passing record for freshmen at North Texas. Coming into the game, the Mean Green ranked 12th nationally in passing offense. Dodge's defensive squad, however, continued to struggle; the team had allowed an average of 209 yards of rushing per game, ranking 107th {{in the nation in}} rushing defense. It also ranked 119th in scoring defense, allowing opponents to score an average of 46.5 points per game. Coming off a bye week, the team entered the game with a 1–7 record.|$|E

5|$|A {{more recent}} {{preparation}} method pioneered by the Royal Ontario Museum removes all bones {{for a complete}} skeleton while also producing a round skin without bill or legs (called a ROM, though if one set of wing and leg bones remain with the skin the preparation is called a shmoo in North America). Alternatively, the entire bird (or any soft parts associated with preparations described above) may be preserved in alcohol. For any of these methods, several supplemental preparations may be made. For example, a wing may be removed and preserved separately as <b>a</b> <b>spread</b> wing for better study of flight feathers; a tissue sample may be removed and frozen for molecular analyses; or a recording of the bird's song before collection may be archived. Neither molecular samples nor sound recordings require a bird to be collected (killed). Finally, if the bird is too rotten for the skin and feathers to be preserved, {{as is the case}} with some salvaged specimens, the skeleton alone may be preserved. Dried tissue is removed from skeletons by using dermestid beetle larvae (genus Dermestes). Whereas in the past arsenic was routinely added to skins to protect them from destruction by insects, specimens prepared today are generally protected by an initial freezing period to kill insects and their eggs followed by keeping them in high-quality museum cases in a climate-controlled room. Each specimen has data associated with it, and the amount of data available is usually directly correlated with the specimen’s scientific value. Most specimens are of little value for research without accompanying information, such as the time and place the bird was found or collected. This and other important information, such as mass, sex, fat deposition, and degree of skull ossification, is written on a label along with a unique field and museum number. Modern computerized museum databases include all of this information for each specimen, as well as the types of methods used to prepare the bird. Modern collections seek to maximize the utility of each preserved individual, and this includes recording detailed information about it. Most modern specimens also include a tissue sample preserved for genetic study. Online access to collections’ data is becoming increasingly available, and a cross-institutional database covering millions of computerized bird records is in development.|$|E
