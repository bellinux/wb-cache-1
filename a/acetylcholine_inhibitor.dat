Using the human α 7 nAChR chimeras and Torpedo marmorata nAChR for homology modeling, we defined orthosteric and allosteric binding sites on the Asu-ACR- 16 receptor for virtual screening.

Hence, the search for such inhibitors especially from natural products is needed in developing potential drugs for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. The present study investigates the cholinesterase inhibitory activity of compounds isolated from three Cryptocarya species towards acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).

40|$|Dementia {{diseases}} are continuously increasing, with a prevalence of 4 / 6 million of new cases per year worldwide. The {{majority of patients}} live in developed countries, where survival into old age is quite common. However, the forecast growth rate of dementia patients is three times higher in India, China and neighboring countries in South Asia and the Western Pacific. Modulation of acetylcholine neurotransmission is a therapeutic approach to dementia when the cholinergic neurons do not present major damage. The different molecules used to enhance central cholinergic tone are: cholinergic precursors, <b>acetylcholine</b> esterase <b>inhibitors,</b> nicotinic receptor agonists and M 2 receptor antagonists. Among the cholinergic precursors, the semi-synthetic compound choline alphoscerate {{has emerged as a}} valid therapeutic approach for the treatment of cognitive impairment in neurological patients.

Literature data suggest that, in these conditions, choline alphoscerate shows a better efficacy than other cholinergic precursors (choline, lecithin, phosphatidylserine and citocoline) and also has a good tolerability and safety profile.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reversible}} <b>acetylcholine</b> esterase <b>inhibitor</b> (−) -physostigmine (eserine) is {{the prototype}} of {{a new class of}} nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activating ligands: it induces cation fluxes into nAChR-rich membrane vesicles from Torpedo marmorala electric tissue even under conditions of antagonist blocked acetylcholine binding sites (Okonjo, Kuhlmann, Maclicke, Neuron, in press). This suggests that eserine exerts its channel-activating property via binding sites at the nAChR separate from those of the natural transmitter. We now report that eserine can activate the channel even when the receptor has been preincubated (desensitized) with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine. Thus the conformational state of the receptor corresponding to desensitization is confined to the transmitter binding region, leaving the channel fully activatable — albeit only from other than the transmitter binding site(s) ...|$|R

Cobratoxin blocks the acetylchloline receptor because of the high affinity. Unfortunately, in 2011 this theory has been disproven.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rivastigmine is an <b>acetylcholine</b> {{esterase}} <b>inhibitor</b> used in {{the treatment}} of dementia. Patches with rivastigmine for transdermal delivery have been used to increase compliance and to reduce side effects. CASE REPORT: We describe an 87 -year old male with dementia treated with multiple rivastigmine patches (Exelon 9, 5 mg/ 24 h) who developed nausea, vomiting and renal failure with disturbed electrolytes resulting in death. The symptoms occurred after six rivastigmine patches had concomitantly been erroneously applied by health care personnel on two consecutive days. The terminal cause of death was considered to be uremia from an acute tubular necrosis that was assessed as a result of dehydration through vomiting. The rivastigmine intoxication was assessed as having caused or contributed to the dehydrated condition. The medication error occurred at least partly due to ambiguous labeling. The clinical signs were not initially recognized as adverse effects of rivastigmine. DISCUSSION: The presented case is a description of a rivastigmine overdose due to a medication error involving patches. This case indicates the importance of clear and unambiguous instructions to avoid administration errors with patches and to be vigilant to adverse drug reactions for early detection and correction of drug administration errors.

SCH 39166 (1, 5 and 10 microM), in the presence of 0. 01 microM neostigmine, reversibly decreased striatal acetylcholine release (1 microM SCH 39166 by 8 +/- 4 %; 5 microM SCH 39166 by 24 +/- 5 %; 10 microM SCH 39166 by 27 +/- 7 %, from basal). Similarly, SCH 39166, applied {{in the presence of a}} higher neostigmine concentration (0. 1 microM), decreased striatal acetylcholine release by 14 +/- 4 % at 1 microM, by 28 +/- 8 % at 5 microM and by 30 +/- 5 % at 10 microM, in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. These results are consistent with the existence of a facilitatory tone of dopamine on striatal acetylcholine transmission mediated by dopamine D(1) receptors located on striatal cholinergic interneuron...|$|R
