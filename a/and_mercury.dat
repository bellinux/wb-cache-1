5|$|The group 12 {{elements}} {{have multiple}} effects on biological organisms as cadmium <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> are toxic while zinc {{is required by}} most plants and animals in trace amounts.|$|E
5|$|The three group 12 {{elements}} that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium <b>and</b> <b>mercury.</b> They are all {{widely used in}} electric and electronic applications, {{as well as in}} various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed.

5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships.

The first all-steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris <b>and</b> <b>Mercury,</b> laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006, MNM {{were placed}} in an angle in which they found {{themselves}} in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro <b>and</b> <b>Mercury</b> started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. Off-screen, Nitro <b>and</b> <b>Mercury</b> did not get along, and WWE management decided to split the tag team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. In addition, Mercury was about to begin serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Trish Stratus (accompanied by Mickie James) defended her WWE Women's Championship against Melina (accompanied by WWE Tag Team Champions Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro.

Melina kept control until Stratus fought back with forearm shots. Stratus pinned Melina after a diving bulldog {{to retain the}} title.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{most other}} d-block groups, the {{abundance}} in Earth's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number.

5|$|Sodium forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of electrolytic production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium <b>and</b> <b>mercury)</b> are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Tompion was {{the first}} English clockmaker with an {{international}} reputation {{and many of his}} pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge who created the first lever escapement. Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who used the Pinchbeck alloy.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium <b>and</b> <b>mercury</b> is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
