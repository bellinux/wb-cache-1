5|$|Ezarik {{posted a}} video <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> order a cheeseburger on YouTube. It got 600,000 views {{in its first}} week. Ezarik has come to view iJustine as a character. As a result, she does not curse or drink on any videos she releases. By January 2009 she reduced her lifecasting {{a few hours a}} week, and by April 2009 her lifecast channel fell silent. When Ezarik first moved to Los Angeles, she was managed by Richard Frias, who also manages YouTube celebrities HappySlip and KevJumba, but {{according}} to a post on Ezarik's alternate Twitter account, she was unmanaged and earned money by appearing at conferences and in online promotional spots. At the time, she believed that her fanbase was predominately between the ages of 11 and 18.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records {{changed its}} name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville No Depression, was {{recorded}} over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in Boston, Massachusetts. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential Persian Gulf War military draft. Impressed by their previous work on Dinosaur Jr.'s Bug, the band wanted Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 Gibson Les Paul SG Junior that J. Mascis originally played on Bug. The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.|$|E

5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, then push the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{business}} issues forced Tibbets's family {{to return to}} Alton, Illinois, where he graduated from Western Military Academy in 1933. He then attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, and became an initiated member of the Epsilon Zeta Chapter of Sigma Nu fraternity in 1934. During that time, Tibbets took private flying lessons at Miami's Opa-locka Airport with Rusty Heard, who later became a captain at Eastern Airlines. After his undergraduate work, Tibbets had planned on becoming an abdominal surgeon. He transferred to the University of Cincinnati after his second year to complete his pre-med studies there, because the University of Florida had no medical school at the time. However, he attended for only {{a year and a}} half as he changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> become a doctor. Instead, he decided to enlist in the United States Army and become a pilot in the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{junior high}} school, they meet a tall, {{eccentric}} girl who befriends everyone named Chizuru Sarashina and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, {{who does not}} get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much {{to the surprise of}} their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased Shuichi <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as Shuichi begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.|$|E

5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E

Pierrothito's victory was seen as a bit of a surprise, first and {{foremost}} because he was a Rudo just like Demus 3:16, but also because Demus and Bam Bam, the last man eliminated by Pierrothito, was a longtime rival and had frequently talked <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> move up a division in various interviews.|$|E

25|$|Film scholar Greg Jenkins {{has done}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the adaptation of the novel as a screenplay. The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on Parris Island, and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick has had since the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Marlene and Naomi Olive worsened after {{the move to}} the United States, and their arguments began to erupt into domestic violence. Over time, Marlene Olive also developed resentment toward her father for siding with her mother in disputes and suspected him of informing police about her friends' drug activities. She shoplifted, stole her parents' credit cards, used and overdosed on drugs, ran away from home, and received stolen goods from burglaries committed by a boyfriend. She talked to several friends <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> kill her parents and asked {{some of them to}} help, but the friends either did not take her seriously or decided not to get involved. At one point, she attempted to poison her mother herself by mixing large doses of prescription drugs into her mother's food, but the drugs made the food taste bitter, and Naomi refused to eat it.|$|E

This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's why I want my unborn son to be like my daddy, I want my husband to be like my daddy, there is no one else like my daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Lady Gaga and RedOne.

The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really <b>about</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along with.
