Careful planning and production methods enabled <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> completion time of 6 months; the game was finished before even acquiring a distribution partner. Grin used TQM methods to ensure a high standard of work, and JIT techniques to ensure the timing of different production phases came together.|$|E
5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding well {{out in front of}} him on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E
5|$|In her summation, however, Karros manages an {{effective}} damage control, pointing {{out to the}} jury that the case in question was not the past record of Varrick but solely the effects of Krayoxx, and that Finley & Figg has in no way proven a connection between Krayoxx {{and the death of}} their client's late husband. The jury is convinced and renders <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> verdict totally rejecting the Krayoxx tort claim and giving Varrick their expected vindication. Still, Zinc's former colleagues of Rogan Rothberg express their grudging respect for his spirited cross-examination, and even help Zinc get even with an obnoxious blogger who had been ceaselessly maligning Zinc and Zinc's wife. Moreover, Karros keeps her promise and agrees to drop all the frivolous lawsuit and legal malpractice proceedings against Finley & Figg. Varrick has no special grudge against this small firm, though they intend to settle accounts with their old foe Alisandros and extract from him big sums on a frivolous lawsuit.|$|E

The Rebels returned to the NCAA Tournament in 1997, their first appearance in six years. Bayno was let go in 2000, after the NCAA found that UNLV had violated rules while recruiting Lamar Odom. Odom ultimately chose Rhode Island over UNLV.|$|E
25|$|Cheating {{allegations}} {{were made at}} {{the first round of}} the 1994 season, the Brazilian Grand Prix. On lap21 of the race, Senna in the Williams who was leading the race, made a pit stop, with Michael Schumacher in the Benetton close behind. The Benetton pitcrew made <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> stop for Schumacher, getting him out in front of Senna to lead the race. Schumacher went on to win the Grand Prix after Senna spun out of the race. This sparked speculation that Benetton were using a system to make quicker pit stops than their rivals.|$|E

25|$|David, lyric tenor. The lyric tenor is a warm graceful {{voice with}} a bright, full timbre that is strong but not heavy {{and can be}} heard over an orchestra. Lyric tenors have a range from {{approximately}} the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the D one octave above middle C (D5). The extent of his range evident in Il Divo's recordings shows he can sing from C3 up to E5. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick,</b> falsettoed E5 can be heard on their first album in the song Hoy Que Ya No Estas Aqui.|$|E
25|$|Thus England, who had {{expected}} to begin their second innings chasing a hundred runs or more, were actually leading by six as they took up their bats in mid-afternoon. Australia took <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> wicket, that of Andrew Strauss, who was dismissed again by Shane Warne, caught bat-and-pad by Katich for a solitary run. The wicket was Warne's 167th against England, equalling Dennis Lillee's Ashes bowling record. 11 balls after this dismissal, umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden judged it unfair to continue play due to inadequate light. One additional session of play was however subsequently possible, taking England to a 40-run lead without further loss, before poor light ended the day.|$|E

With the chord progression of Bm7-E-A-D--C#m7, the song is written in the key of A major. Harket demonstrates a vocal range of over two and a half octaves.

The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E

40|$|Constella is <b>a</b> novel <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> {{response}} {{satellite platform}} {{that can be}} used in any Low Earth Orbit, It can be used as a single unit or as part of a constellation of spacecraft. It can be pre-manufactured to a large extent, and a selection of subsystems can be ready to select from, to provide last-minute configuration options for both the payload and platform. This satellite contains a number of innovations that have not been used in space before, and they will allow <b>very</b> <b>quick</b> response missions to take place. Only <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short time is required to decide on the mission and plan the satellite design, then assemble the final parts, and test and launch the satellite into orbit. The total time can be down to weeks or even days. Unlike most quick-response missions, where anything under one year is included, and where the satellite typically has to be completely ready and tested, waiting for quick call-up, the Constella can be tailored with interchangeable attitude sensors, propulsion units, communications equipment, payloads and more, just before launch, even right at the launch site if required. The platform produces almost the same amount electrical power, irrespective of orbital inclination or ascending node time, removing the need for solar panel design changes at the configuration stage. </p...|$|R

Detection of femA {{was used as}} an internal positive control. The multiplex PCR assay combined the primers for sea to see and femA in one set and those for eta, etb, tst, mecA, and femA in the other set. Validation of the assay was performed using 176 human isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.
