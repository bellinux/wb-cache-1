25|$|In the United States, {{a special}} {{procedure}} {{is required to}} obtain the pharmaceutical. In most other countries, <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> is required which explains these risks. Women taking isotretinoin must not get pregnant during and for 1 month after the discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy. Sexual abstinence or effective contraception is mandatory during this period. Barrier methods by themselves (e.g., condoms) are not considered adequate due to the unacceptable failure rates of approximately 3%. Women who fall pregnant whilst on isotretinoin therapy are generally counselled to have a termination. Isotretinoin {{has no effect on}} male fertility.|$|E
25|$|Prior to surgery, {{the patient}} is given a medical examination, {{receives}} certain pre-operative tests, and their physical status is rated according to the ASA physical status classification system. If these results are satisfactory, the patient signs <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> and is given a surgical clearance. If the procedure is expected to result in significant blood loss, an autologous blood donation may be made some weeks prior to surgery. If the surgery involves the digestive system, the patient may be instructed to perform a bowel prep by drinking a solution of polyethylene glycol {{the night before the}} procedure. Patients are also instructed to abstain from food or drink (an NPO order after midnight on the night before the procedure), to minimize the effect of stomach contents on pre-operative medications and reduce the risk of aspiration if the patient vomits during or after the procedure.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to <b>a</b> <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She {{was taken into}} an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E
