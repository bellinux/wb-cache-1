40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} whether the use of Private Military and Security Companies strengthens military institutions and the provision of security or, on the contrary, questions the monopoly of the legitimate use of force and generates new challenges to the current role of the military. It analyzes three main realms within the military sphere where the presence of PMSCS may have a direct impact: the exercise of the monopoly of the use of violence, the professionalization of the military, and the process of enrollment of new recruits. The paper highlights that the presence of PMSCS does not affect the continuity of the state’s monopoly of the legitimate use of force. It also argues that although PMSCS perform certain activities that enhance the provision of security in a state, the military should always be prepared to overtake those <b>activities</b> <b>delegated</b> to PMSCS and should avoid becoming excessively dependent on private companies to execute them. Likewise, the paper sustains that the privatization of security distorts the conception of professionalism put up front by CMR theorists. Finally, the paper states that the presence of PMSCS obliges today’s military to strengthen its recruitment strategies and consolidate a sound enrollment process...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a {{multiple}} case study analysis of ten Italian business groups controlled by families {{to answer the}} following research questions: Does the controlling shareholder, through the parent company {{at the top of the}} pyramidal group, always exercise the direction activity of the subsidiaries? If not, why does the parent company not exercise that <b>activity,</b> <b>delegating</b> it to its subsidiaries? What is the degree of separation between control and direction within the group? A high percentage of our sample declares not to be directed by the parent company. However, the presence of family members on the subsidiaries’ boards and the low boards’ independence makes the separation between direction and control more apparent than real. The credibility of the separation is questioned mostly for those non-directed subsidiaries that operate in the same sector. Our analysis suggests some elements, in order to understand in which cases the direction activity by the parent (or its delegation to the subsidiaries) should be interpreted positively or negatively in terms of controlling shareholder expropriation, by proposing to use the degree of separation between direction and control as a proxy to assess indirectly the degree of that expropriation...|$|R

40|$|The ‘Students as Teaching and Learning Consultants’ project aims {{to build}} student and staff {{dialogue}} about {{teaching and learning}} approaches, activities and experiences by adopting a partnership model and a collaborative ethos positioning students as active participants central to producing knowledge about how to enhance and develop teaching and learning. The project offers academic staff a qualified student perspective (at points of need) {{that goes beyond the}} end of module evaluation and national student survey data. The session will explore project findings related to how to go beyond merely “listening to students” and instead view students as “change-agents”; equal and knowledgeable partners in structuring the teaching and learning experience. The session begins with a short introduction to the project. In the first group <b>activity</b> <b>delegates</b> work with matching cards featuring a variety of mechanisms for student consultation written on them (such as student panel, NSS) with cards that have characteristics written on them (such as anonymous, tokenistic, developmental). The groups then feedback to compare the selections made and the reasoning behind this. In a second activity, groups are asked to use the “Diamond 9 technique” as a tool to prioritise these student consultation mechanisms according to whether they are collaborative and reflect student as active participants working in partnership with staff. The authors will introduce Arnstein’s ladder of citizen participation, and an adapted version relating to levels of student participation developed by Bovill and Bulley (2011). The <b>activities</b> will enable <b>delegates</b> to reflect on their current models for student engagement and active participation, to discuss and explore what it means to have authentic student participation/engagement and discover ways to achieve this...|$|R

For this study the historical and dialectical and systematic approach and analysis were applied. The {{first part of the}} analysis covers the period until 2005 – the stage before the accession of the country to EU. There the first legislative acts from the post-liberation period 1897 - 1906 are analyzed, which {{marked the beginning of the}} regulated anti-epizootic <b>activity,</b> <b>delegated</b> as a primary duty of the state institutions. Special attention is paid to the Law on sanitary-veterinary service from 1924, elaborated by Prof. G. Pavlov, which laid down the foundations of the Public Veterinary Medicine in Bulgaria. An analysis is made of the basic principles in the legislative basis in the period of centralized planning (1945 - 1990) and the period of transition to market economy (1990 - 2004) before the accession of Bulgaria to the EU. The retrospective analysis of all laws from this 120 -year period shows that veterinary legislation has developed in line with the socio-political and economic conditions in the country, but it has always been in accordance with the international legal norms. The second part of the analysis, which includes the period following the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the EU, will interpret the organizational and legal, structural, professional, deontological, financial economic aspects and problems which occurred after the establishment of Bulgarian Food Safety Agency in order to improve the system related to animal health and food safety...|$|R
