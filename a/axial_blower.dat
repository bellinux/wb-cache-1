50|$|Direct {{hydrogen}} cooling {{is employed}} in the stator terminals. The rotor forging is of nickel chromium molybdenum vanadium steel having a minimum yield point of 33.2 ton/in.2. The shaft end which connects to the turbine is deferentially tempered to give additional strength to withstand the severe forces which could be applied under fault conditions on the generator. The first three critical speeds are arranged to be below the running speed. The hydrogen-cooled rotor conductors are formed from silver-bearing hard drawn copper tube. Two tubes in parallel form one conductor and there are six conductors per slot except for the slots adjacent to the pole centres, which contain five. The generator is ventilated by cold gas fed {{to a number of}} radial ducts at the slipring end of the core, which communicate with the axial vent holes in the core and stator teeth. After passing through the axial holes the gas is discharged into the ‘air’ gap through further radial ducts at the turbine end of the core. The gas discharged from the core passes along the ‘air’ gap, together with the hot gas discharged from the outlet holes in the rotor body, to the region between the end windings and a baffle at the slipring end, and thence through one half of each axial cooler to the blower intake. After leaving the blower, the gas is passed through the other halves of the coolers and is delivered to the various inlet regions of the stator core and rotor. Gas is fed to the turbine end of the rotor through axial holes machined in the hub of the blower rotor from an annulus formed between the end bracket and the blower outlet diffuser. Large diameter tubes passing longitudinally through the stator frame connect this annulus to the extreme end section at the slipring end, from which the slipring end of the rotor is fed. The three-stage <b>axial</b> <b>blower</b> mounted on the generator shaft comprises a shaft-mounted sleeve upon which is mounted the bladed rotor disc, a bladed stator casing, a diffuser and an inlet fairing.|$|E

The efforts are directed toward improving the efficiencies, which are already high for the <b>axial</b> <b>blower,</b> and in particular the delivery pressure heads. For high pressures multistage arrangements are used. Of fundamental importance is the careful design of all structural parts of the blower that are subject to the effects of the flow.

40|$|With {{the further}} {{development}} of axial blowers into highly loaded flow machines, {{the influence of the}} diameter ratio upon air output and efficiency gains in significance. Clarification of this matter is important for single-stage axial compressors, and is of still greater importance for multistage ones, and particularly for aircraft power plants. Tests with a single-stage <b>axial</b> <b>blower</b> gave a decrease in the attainable maximum pressure coefficient and optimum efficiency as the diameter ratio increased. The decrease must be ascribed chiefly to the guide surface of the hub and housing between the blades increasing with the diameter ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} <b>axial</b> <b>blowers</b> {{operate on}} the high-pressure principle. One drawback {{of this type of}} blower is the relatively low pressure head, which one attempts to overcome with <b>axial</b> <b>blowers</b> producing very high pressure at a given circumferential speed.

40|$|A {{computer}} program for predicting the wide-band noise spectrom of <b>axial</b> <b>blower</b> rotors from flow field variables was developed. First, a bibliographic search {{was carried out}} on current methods of noise prediction. The main input parameters of the selected methods were varied systematically {{in the sense of}} a sensitivity analysis in order to check the plausibility of the results and assess the accuracy required of the input parameters. The selected methods were implemented in a user-friendly PC program ('SIBNOISE-AX'). The methods and the {{computer program}} were tested using the example of two blowers, i. e. a low-pressure and a high-pressure <b>axial</b> <b>blower.</b> Both blowers were calculated without guide wheels as the research project focused on rotor wheel noise only. Aerodynamic and acoustic data were obtained in a standard test stand in order to provide a data base. Time-averaged flow fields in the rotor wheels were calculated using a commercial CFD code, and parameters like boundary layer thickness and relevant velocities in the blade region were derived which - in addition to simple estimates - were used as input parameters in the noise prediction methods. The results provided by the calculations differed depending on the method employed, but some methods provided results that were in good agreement with the measurements. Their accuracy was sufficient even when the input parameters were only estimated and could be improved further by using the numerically calculated flow field parameters. The research project was thus completed successfully.

40|$|LecturePg. 73 - 82 The {{repair work}} of a large <b>axial</b> <b>blower</b> that had its rotor and stator blades {{severely}} damaged is described. The 43 MW axial air blower is of critical importance for a large steel mill in Brazil, and the repair time was of the utmost importance. The circumstances in which the failure occurred, along with the investigation work for the causes, are also discussed. The failure of a second blower while {{the first one was}} under repair, which brought about a serious risk of loss of a blast furnace, and the measures taken to put it back to operation in a very short time, are also discussed. _ The purpose herein is to demonstrate the feasibility of reliable temporary repairs on mechanically damaged machines to reduce production loss in a very short time...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the flow characteristics of the laminar and the turbulent boundary layers on rotating blades of an axial-flow turbomachine, a theoretical analysis was performed taking the chord-wise pressure gradient into account with the aid of the rotating helical coordinates. Comparison of the calculated results of rotating blades with those of two－dimensional stationary ones showed that the secondary flow induced over the rotating blades has strong effect of suppressing the boundary layer growth, which results in that the transition and the separation of the boundary layer are much delayed. This effect increases with an increase of attack angle. To prove the validity of the theory, measurements were performed with an <b>axial</b> <b>blower</b> equipment. The measured results showed that the present analysis is well applicable to the estimation of the flow characteristics of the boundary layers on relatively thin and small-cambered rotating blades to the chord length...|$|E

Hydrogen at a pressure of 60 psig, is employed for cooling the stator core and rotor conductors, the gas being {{in direct contact with}} the rotor conductors, and water is used for cooling the stator conductors. Hydrogen coolers are arranged longitudinally in {{the upper part of the}} stator frame and the hydrogen is circulated by an <b>axial</b> flow <b>blower</b> mounted on the turbine end of the rotor shaft. The stator is of two-part construction, the core and windings being assembled in a skeleton innerframe threaded into the outer stator frame at site.

40|$|Researches are {{conducted}} in vineyard and apple orchard with {{two different types}} of mist <b>blowers,</b> <b>axial</b> (Hardi Zaturn) and radial (Hardi Arrow). The influence of major technical spraying factors (type of nozzle, working speed and spray volume) were observed on coverage of the treated area, average droplet diameter, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift. The working speed of sprayer was set at 6 and 8 km/h, and spray volume on 250, 325 and 400 l/ha for apple orchard and 250, 300 and 350 l/ha for vineyard. Researchers used Lechler blue (TR 8003), yellow (TR 8002) and green (TR 80015) nozzles. The research was set as three - factorial field experiment with 18 treatments in 4 repetitions, for different type of sprayer and permanent crops. We used 60 water sensitive papers for that treatment, which were processed with digital image analysis and ImageJ software. In addition to the main features of the research, research showed leaf area index and density, speed and flow of air current, working pressure, orientation of the nozzles and weather conditions, which were monitored during the study. Before the research, mist blowers are tested according to the European standard 13790. By decreasing the ISO number of nozzles and by increasing the working speed and spray volume, we found increase of area coverage, number of droplets per cm 2 and drift, and decrease of average droplet diameter. Also, by comparing the results of research exploitation by axial and radial mist blower in the vineyards and apple orchards, better results are achieved with radial mist blower (Hardi Arrow) in both cases. The best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift in vineyard were achieved with 64. 22 % area coverage and 17. 11 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 6 km/h, spray volume of 350 l/ha, and working pressure of 10. 99 bar). In apple orchard the best relationship of area coverage and liquid drift were achieved with 59. 55 % area coverage and 21. 10 % of liquid drift (green nozzle, working speed of 8 km/h, spray volume of 325 l/ha, and working pressure of 16. 84 bar) ...|$|R
