Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually.

40|$|Abstract—Prior {{work has}} shown that {{uncontrolled}} messaging in ad-hoc opportunistic networks results in <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>sharing</b> of network capacity. Solutions based on publicly verifiable sender authentication mechanisms, {{such as those in}} [1], require complete message transmission for proper verification. However, introducing message fragmentation, e. g., to optimize limited transmission opportunities, could negatively impact resource management. Unverifiable message fragments that are assigned lower priorities are discarded sooner and reduce delivery ratios. This paper investigates the extent of this impact and shows that publicly verifiable fragment authentication mechanisms are needed to retain the benefits of fragmentation as well as resource management. We take this a step further and show through simulations that strong authenticity guarantees for intermediaries are unnecessary in our specific scenario. Best-effort authentication schemes, where the probability of false positives is much higher than in typical authentication schemes, are sufficient. This suggests the existence of other scenarios where this approach is also applicable. We describe various best-effort authentication techniques and analyze their computation and space savings.

25|$|The potato was {{introduced}} to Ireland as a garden crop of the gentry. By the late 17th century, it had become widespread as a supplementary rather than a principal food because the main diet still revolved around butter, milk, and grain products. However, {{in the first two}} decades of the 18th century, it became a base food of the poor, especially in winter. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> <b>share</b> of the potatoes grown in Ireland were of a single variety, the Irish Lumper. The expansion of the economy between 1760 and 1815 saw the potato make inroads into the diet of the people and become a staple food year round for farmers. The large dependency on this single crop, and the lack of genetic variability among the potato plants in Ireland, were two of the reasons why the emergence of Phytophthora infestans had such devastating effects in Ireland and less severe effects elsewhere in Europe.|$|E

To ensure that hospitals are reimbursed an adequate amount for care of indigent populations, Medicare reimburses hospitals an additional percentage amount according to federally set financial schedule. At 15 % of <b>a</b> <b>disproportionate</b> patient percentage, <b>a</b> hospital is reimbursed an extra 2. 5 % of the standard prospective payment rate. ObjectiveThis research seeks to determine whether hospital qualification as <b>a</b> Medicare <b>Disproportionate</b> <b>Share</b> Hospital results in higher patient experience ratings. MethodsA regression discontinuity method {{was used to determine}} the effect of lagged <b>Disproportionate</b> <b>Share</b> Hospital (DSH) status on next year patient experience ratings. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems data provide publicly available patient ratings. ResultsOn average, hospital ratings increase by 6 % as a result of DSH status. Hospital ratings increase by an average of 6. 5 % when nonprofit hospitals are analyzed. This finding is primarily driven by patient facility cleanliness and medical provider communication ratings. ConclusionsThe federal mandate that individuals purchase health insurance in the United States coupled with the state expansion of Medicaid coverage will theoretically eliminate the need for Medicare DSH payments. It is calculated, however, that hospitals will need increased Medicaid reimbursements of more than $ 300 per patient {{to make up for the}} loss of Medicare DSH reimbursements. Hospitals will likely suffer financially as a direct result of reduced Medicare reimbursements through the DSH program...|$|R

When interest groups are sufficiently patient, or when shares in the concession game are very unequal, agreement is reached more quickly on average under bargaining.
