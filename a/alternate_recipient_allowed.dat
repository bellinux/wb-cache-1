40|$|AbstractObjective: An <b>alternate</b> (second) adult <b>recipient</b> {{list was}} used to match {{excluded}} potential recipients with nonstandard donor hearts {{that would otherwise be}} unused. Methods: The only absolute criterion for entering the <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> list was age: 65 years old before 1998 and 70 years old after that. Group I consisted of alternates who underwent transplantation, and group II consisted of 401 contemporaneous recipients. Hearts were first offered to regularly listed patients. At least one of the following donor risks accounted for allocation to an alternate: coronary artery disease, reused transplanted heart, high-risk behavior, hepatitis seropositivity, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, high inotropic requirement, left ventricular hypertrophy, age older than 55 years plus another risk, and small donor with no other matches. Results: Of 102 alternates, 82 were listed were because of age. After a median wait of 107 days, 62 alternates underwent transplantation. Median <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> age was 67 years (vs 54 years, P 90 days) death rates per 1000 person-months were 4. 3 and 3. 6 for groups I and II (relative risk 1. 2, 0. 62 - 2. 36). Conclusions: Use of two adult recipient lists facilitated allocation of unused donor organs. Satisfactory long-term survival supports the use of an <b>alternate</b> <b>recipient</b> list.

When the party paused to rest in an orange grove on the Honolulu side of the Pali, the others joined in the hummings, and the song was completed later at Washington Place.|$|R

40|$|On January 1, 2006, {{the federal}} {{government}} began providing insurance coverage for Medicare recipients' prescription drug expenditures through a new program known as Medicare Part D. Rather than setting pharmaceutical prices itself, the government contracted with private insurance plans to provide this coverage. Enrollment in Part D was voluntary, with each Medicare <b>recipient</b> <b>allowed</b> to choose {{from one of the}} private insurers with a contract to offer coverage in her geographic region. This paper evaluates the effect of this program on the price and utilization of pharmaceutical treatments. Theoretically, it is ambiguous whether the expansion in insurance coverage would increase or reduce pharmaceutical prices. Insurance-induced reductions in demand elasticities would predict an increase in pharmaceutical firms' optimal prices. However, Part D plans could potentially negotiate price discounts through their ability to influence the market share of specific treatments. Using data on product-specific prices and quantities sold in each year in the U. S., our findings indicate that Part D substantially lowered the average price and increased the total utilization of prescription drugs by Medicare recipients. Our results further suggest that the magnitude of these average effects varies across drugs as predicted by economic theory. ...|$|R
50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have a mail queue, such as a mail storage server acting as a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA). Mail queues are an inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since a mail storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for a mail queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for a mail message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each <b>recipient,</b> <b>allowing</b> the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be an Internet-facing mail gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks.

40|$|Localized sets {{of random}} point {{mutations}} generated by PCR amplification {{can be transferred}} efficiently to the chromosome of Acinetobacter ADP 1 (also known as strain BD 413) by natural transformation. The technique does not require cloning of PCR fragments in plasmids: PCR-amplified DNA fragments are internalized by cells and directly incorporated into their genomes by homologous recombination. Previously such procedures for random mutagenesis could be applied only to Acinetobacter genes affording the selection of mutant phenotypes. Here we describe {{the construction of a}} vector and <b>recipient</b> that <b>allow</b> for mutagenesis, recovery, and expression of heterologous genes that may lack a positive selection. The plasmid carries an Acinetobacter chromosomal segment interrupted by a multiple cloning site next to a kanamycin resistance marker. The insertion of heterologous DNA into the multiple cloning site prepares the insert as a target for PCR mutagenesis. PCR amplifies the kanamycin resistance marker and a flanking region of Acinetobacter DNA along with the insert of heterologous DNA. Nucleotide sequence identity between the flanking regions and corresponding chromosomal segments in an engineered Acinetobacter <b>recipient</b> <b>allows</b> homologous recombination of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments into a specific chromosomal docking site from which they can be expressed. The recipient strain contains only a portion of the kanamycin resistance gene, so donor DNA containing both this gene and the mutagenized insert can be selected by demanding growth of recombinants in the presence of kanamycin. The effectiveness of the technique was demonstrated with the relatively GC-rich Pseudomonas putida xylE gene. After only one round of PCR amplification (35 cycles), donor DNA produced transformants of which up to 30 % carried a defective xylE gene after growth at 37 °C. Of recombinant clones that failed to express xylE at 37 °C, about 10 % expressed the gene when grown at 22 °C. The techniques described here could be adapted to prepare colonies with an altered function in any gene for which either a selection or a suitable phenotypic screen exists...|$|R

Adult vocalizations convey social and ecological information to their <b>recipients</b> <b>allowing</b> them to obtain cues about an ongoing event from calls only. In contrast to adult vocalizations, information encoded in infant calls had been hardly investigated. Studies mainly focused on vocal development. The present article aims at assessing the acoustic cues that support individual identity coding in infant chimpanzees. By analyzing recordings performed in the wild from seven 3 -year-old infant chimpanzees, we showed that their calls support a well-defined individual vocal signature relying on spectral cues. To assess the reliability of the signature across the calls of an individual, we defined two subsets of recordings {{on the basis of the}} characteristics of the frequency modulation (whimpers and screams) and showed that both call types present a reliable vocal signature. Early vocal signature may allow the mother and other individuals in the group to identify the infant caller when visual contact is broken. Chimpanzee mothers may have developed abilities to cope with changing vocal signatures while their infant, still vulnerable, gains in independence in close habitat...|$|R

Groups of 4 -, 12 -, 18 -, and 24 -month-old Fischer 344 rats were infused (via the portal vein) with 2 x 10 (6) hepatocytes isolated from a normal syngenic 2 -month-old donor. Animals deficient in dipeptidyl-peptidase type IV (DPP-IV-) enzyme were used as <b>recipients,</b> <b>allowing</b> for the histochemical detection of injected DPP-IV+ cells. Groups of animals were sacrificed at various times thereafter. No growth of DPP-IV+ transplanted hepatocytes was present after either 2 or 6 months in the liver of rats transplanted at young age, as expected. In striking contrast, significant expansion of donor-derived cells was seen in animals transplanted {{at the age of}} 18 months: clusters comprising 7 - 10 DPP-IV+ hepatocytes/cross-section were present after 2 months and were markedly enlarged after 6 months (mean of 88 +/- 35 cells/cluster/cross-section). These results indicate that the microenvironment of the aged liver supports the clonal expansion of transplanted normal hepatocytes. Such clonogenic environments can foster the selective growth of pre-existing altered cells, thereby increasing the overall risk for cancer development associated with aging...|$|R
