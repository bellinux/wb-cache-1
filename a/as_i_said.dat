500|$|People assume things, because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|Do {{nothing to}} destroy the obscurity she so much desired, that now rests upon the event. It was, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> her last wish... Think what is the {{situation}} of my wife & myself, now deprived of all our children but the youngest & do not expose us to those idle questions, which to a mind in anguish {{is one of the}} severest trials.|$|E
60|$|Than hers, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{there is}} in history no sadder story.|$|R
60|$|Yet, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> when {{on shore}} she was kind-hearted and amiable enough.|$|R
60|$|Her hand pressed mine gently. <b>I</b> {{answered}} <b>as</b> delicately <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could--I <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was sorry, but not surprised, to hear it.|$|R
500|$|The album artwork was {{designed}} by John Lorenzi, who contributed to the covers on Megadeth's two previous albums, Endgame and United Abominations (2007). The title was revealed as 13, with Mustaine commenting [...] "I started playing guitar at 13 and this is our 13th record and I was born on the 13th. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> I {{was going to call}} it '13', I started noticing 13 everywhere. They never used to have 13th floors in hotels but now they have them again." [...] One day later, the band revealed that the title would be rendered as [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] instead of 13. Drover stated in a subsequent interview that [...] "Th1rt3en" [...] had originally been the working title for the album. The cover artwork and track list for the album were revealed on September 7, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The vocals of {{the album}} were {{recorded}} at Sarm East to a click track using a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and other various machines and boxes synced up the tracks. As Langan recalls: [...] "In those days of relatively limited technology we again had to push {{what we had to}} the limit... If, for instance, something required an effect, whether it be tape delay or phasing or some big, delayed reverb, the art was to get that effect right and record it... It all had to be done and then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> it would influence the next process." [...] Langan has noted that balancing the backing vocals in the songs from the album was a major problem, due to no available terabytes of storage. He stated: [...] "We'd make it as clean as we possibly could, bounce that down to two tracks and then we'd erase." ...|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> I pull from {{my personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
60|$|My costume, {{or rather}} my disguise, for, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> {{was wearing a}} poke bonnet with a plain black dress, seemed to puzzle him.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought it}} best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it. So <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>as</b> much. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it lightly, because I felt her trembling.|$|R
60|$|But {{though a}} babe, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>Is</b> born with {{learning}} in his head, He must forget it, if he can, Before {{he calls himself}} a man.|$|R
500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. But to me, it was over. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to the Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|Francisco Vázquez de Coronado {{describes}} his 1541 encounter with [...] "Two {{kinds of people}} travel around these plains with the cows; one is called Querechos and the others Teyas; they are very well built, and painted, and are enemies of each other. They have no other settlement or location than comes from traveling around with the cows. They kill all of these they wish, and tan the hides, with which they clothe themselves and make their tents, and they eat the flesh, sometimes even raw, and they also even drink the blood when thirsty. The tents they make are like field tents, and they set them up over some poles they have made for this purpose, which come together and are tied at the top, and when they go {{from one place to}} another they carry them on some dogs they have, of which they have many, and they load them with the tents and poles and other things, for the country is so level, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> that they can make use of these, because they carry the poles dragging along on the ground. The sun is what they worship most." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but you have a chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as I begin the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E
60|$|His lordship's pale, dreamy eyes had, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> a {{habit of}} observing things, and his wits were tolerably acute.|$|R
60|$|Blood did {{not look}} up from his task. There was not the need. He knew the voice, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said.</b>|$|R

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.|$|E
500|$|A major {{point of}} {{criticism}} the film faced was regarding {{the possibility of}} Army attacking students in a radio station. When Rakeysh was questioned about the same in a scriptwriter's conference conducted by the Film Writers Association in the year 2008, he said the following, [...] "So, in 2005, in Allahabad, a bunch of 4 students took the TV station there, and they were shot dead. Everything I did, {{it was kind of}} was kind of borrowed, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> right here. Obviously, what I am also learning is the way I tell a story is not real; you can term it as a-real. For maximum impact, for the message to go through, I felt—since the story was against the establishment—let the establishment do it. After all, the establishment did hang Bhagat Singh. After all, the establishment did come down on the innocent, innocent students in Mandal Commission. After all the establishment did come down on Tiananmen Square. After all the establishment did come down when the whole concept of Flower Power emerged in America. So it's all there. It's borrowed, maybe not as realistically, but it is definitely there in the society. During emergency, there are horror stories. If {{we have to go back}} to Kriplani and his movement in Bihar, the stories are absolutely horrific." ...|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – but, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> the expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E
60|$|With Old File, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> {{became quite}} friendly. Excepting {{the secrets of}} our prison-house, he was ready enough to talk on {{subjects}} about which I was curious.|$|R
60|$|So {{everything}} must be begun afresh: and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{walked with}} the impi towards the Ghost Mountain, I thought much and often of {{the manner in}} which this might be done. But <b>as</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing.|$|R
60|$|The deck, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{was at a}} very stiff cant. His Excellency sat down, slid to leeward, and {{was asleep}} again.|$|R
2500|$|... 4. Among the {{rejected}} [...] writings must be reckoned, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> the Apocalypse of John, if it seem proper, which some, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> reject, {{but which}} others class with the accepted books.|$|E
2500|$|Mahathir bin Mohamad, {{the former}} Prime Minister of Malaysia said in 2002, [...] "Islam, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> is a {{religion}} of peace. However through the centuries, deviations from the true teachings of Islam take place. And so [...] "Muslims" [...] kill despite the injunction of their religion against killing especially of innocent people.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, radio {{broadcaster}} Alan Jones {{commented on}} the push to legalise same-sex marriage saying, [...] "my view is that when people find love, {{they should be able}} to celebrate it. And they shouldn't be discriminated against according to the nature of that love. To deny people the recognition for a relationship which is based on love is to deny, in my opinion, one of humankind's most basic, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> elusive, qualities. Let the Parliament vote. It makes the laws of the land... we shouldn't be frightened about celebrating the love of one person for another." [...] Prime Minister Abbott said [...] "I deeply respect his views and I’m confident that he would respect mine, he would respect my sister’s, he would respect Bill Shorten’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and Warren Entsch’s, and that’s what we need – we need to see mutual respect of all the different views on this debate because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> decent people can differ on this subject." ...|$|E
60|$|But for awhile, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> that darkness, solitude, {{and silence}} {{were to be}} sought in the grot, not in the grove.|$|R
60|$|The priests, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> before, were {{accounted}} necromancers: {{the appearance}} of two of our three visitors might have justified the conceit.|$|R

2500|$|Although harshly {{condemned}} by critics who decried {{its lack of}} conventional finish, Manet's work had admirers from the beginning. One was Émile Zola, who wrote in 1867: [...] "We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{there is such a}} surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with TheWrap, Freeman {{was asked if}} he considered himself atheist or agnostic. [...] He replied, [...] "It's a hard question because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> at the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|E
2500|$|In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese recalls that, [...] "I {{left that}} room feeling hurt and humiliated. I did {{something}} I virtually never do, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> much earlier: I {{went out and}} got drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night the rain was trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on the windows could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|E
60|$|But, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> {{our hero}} {{was too far}} gone now to contain himself until all {{that he had to}} say was out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{the unhappy}} {{cause of the}} change, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> before! ... Well, as you will! ... But human nature can't help being itself." ...|$|R
