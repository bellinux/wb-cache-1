In the current tourist offer, tourism of events presents a kind of tourism that could contribute to extending the tourist demand, especially if tourist site or region already posses natural and anthropogenic values. Municipality of Kruševac represents regional and cultural centre of Rasina region in Serbia, {{as well as the}} crossroad of tourist transit ways to mount Kopaonik, mount Jastrebac and spa Vrnjačka Banja. The aim of this research is to establish the correlation between the events in Kruševac, as well as the determination of event number, ranking, type, regional distribution, but also the organizational and marketing activities that follow those events. Most important aspect of this research will be in function of foreseeing the potentials for the event tourism development and <b>affirmation</b> of existing <b>events</b> that take place within this municipality.

40|$|In this paper, {{originally}} {{presented as}} a talk to “The Barbarisation of Warfare” conference, held at the University of Wolverhampton on 27 – 28 June 2005, I indicate that if warfare is perceived as barbaric today – possibly {{more so than in}} the past – then this {{has more to do with}} our subjective confusion as to the purpose and direction of contemporary society, as well as the conflicts produced by it, than by any objective index of barbarism. While all sides in recent conflicts appear to have behaved in a degenerate or degrading manner to one another, it is worth noting that much of this perception stems from a Western inability to comprehend suicide as sacrifice, due to the demise of purpose and commitment, as well as a refusal to confront the corrosion and corruption of Western culture, and in particular the confusion and conflation of the public–private divide, driven from the top of society down. Unfortunately, a well-meaning but moralistic focus on acts of barbarism has encouraged a less than critical mindset to develop, which seeks <b>affirmation</b> in particular <b>events,</b> irrespective of evidence. This approach also fails to build a robust and effective political challenge to those who have argued for Western intervention in the affairs of other states. Indeed, these two outlooks can often exist side-by-side, thereby revealing their inner bankruptcy. of depravity or western fixations...|$|R

O se é utilizado em situações cuja ocorrência é possível porém incerta; e quando em eventos que apresentam maior grau de certeza. Procurou-se identificar em que idade as crianças são capazes de distinguir o significado de se e quando no caso em que são sinônimos e naqueles que não podem sobrepor-se. Crianças de 3 e 5 anos foram apresentadas a diferentes tipos de sentenças condicionais (preditivas presente e passado) iniciadas por se e por quando. Deveriam identificar dentre três desenhos qual representava o que havia sido lido. Aos 3 anos são capazes de identificar sentenças nas quais os dois são sinônimos. Já em sentenças nas quais se e quando não são sinônimos, o desempenho das crianças decresce, principalmente naquelas envolvendo se. Uma das explicações seria que o {{temporal}} quando geralmente faz afirmações sobre eventos do mundo real e o condicional se especifica situações hipotéticas cujas habilidades envolvidas surgem mais tarde. Bowerman (1979) and Reilly (1986) {{argued that}} constructions using the conditional if, albeit being similar morphologically and syntactically to sentences that involve, for example, and, when and because, and also having similar meanings, {{are the last}} to appear in children’s productions. If is used to express situations whose occurence is possible but unsure; whereas when is used to express events that present a higher grade of certainty. We tried to identify in what age children are able to differenciate the meaning of if and when in cases where they are synonyms and in case where they cannot be superposed. Three and 5 year-old children were presented different classes of conditional sentences (predictive, present, and past) which started with if and when. Children identified among three pictures which one represented what had been read. Three year-olds {{were able to identify}} sentences in which the two are synonyms, but when they are not (predictive and past), children’s performance in both age groups decline, mainly with the sentences involving if. One of the explanations is that the temporal when usually expresses <b>affirmations</b> about <b>events</b> of the real world, whereas the conditional if specifies hypothetical situations that involve abilities which develop later...|$|R
40|$|In {{contemporary}} game development {{circles the}} ‘game making jam’ {{has become an}} important rite of passage and baptism event, an exploration space and a central indie lifestyle <b>affirmation</b> and community <b>event.</b> Game jams have recently become a focus for design researchers interested in the creative process. In this paper we {{tell the story of}} an established local game jam and our various documentation and data collection methods. We present the beginnings of the current project, which seeks to map the creative teams and their process in the space of the challenge, and which aims to enable participants to be more than the objects of the data collection. A perceived issue is that typical documentation approaches are ‘about’ the event as opposed to ‘made by’ the participants and are thus both at odds with the spirit of the jam as a phenomenon and do not really access the rich playful potential of participant experience. In the data collection and visualisation projects described here, we focus on using collected data to re-include the participants in telling stories about their experiences of the event as a place-based experience. Our goal is to find a means to encourage production of ‘anecdata’ - data based on individual story telling that is subjective, malleable, and resists collection via formal mechanisms - and to enable mimesis, or active narrating, {{on the part of the}} participants. We present a concept design for data as game based on the logic of early medieval maps and we reflect on how we could enable participation in the data collection itself...|$|R
