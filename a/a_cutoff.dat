5|$|On 7 November 1957, after Sputnik {{and under}} {{pressure}} to bring on a dedicated science advisor, Eisenhower created the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC), which {{had the effect of}} eroding the AEC's monopoly over scientific advice. In stark contrast to the AEC, PSAC promoted a test ban and argued against Strauss's claims concerning its strategic implications and technical feasibility. In late 1957, the Soviet Union made a second offer of a three-year moratorium without inspections, but lacking any consensus within his administration, Eisenhower rejected it. In early 1958, the discord within American circles, particularly among scientists, was made clear in hearings before the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Disarmament, chaired by Senator Hubert Humphrey. The hearings featured conflicting testimony from the likes of Teller and Linus Pauling, as well as from Harold Stassen, who argued that a test ban could safely be separated from broader disarmament, and AEC members, who argued that <b>a</b> <b>cutoff</b> in nuclear production should precede a test ban.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subtropical}} depression {{exited the}} Mozambique Channel, {{another area of}} convection formed in the region on January8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January12, which split off <b>a</b> <b>cutoff</b> low-pressure area. Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira, Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection. The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east. On January16, the MFR reclassified {{the system as a}} tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had begun an eastward movement, but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high-pressure areas. Late on January16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast. Also that day, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 12S. This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm, at the time the third-latest on record.|$|E

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of horn loudspeakers {{is they are}} more efficient; they can typically produce 10 times (10 dB) more sound power than a cone speaker from a given amplifier output. Therefore horns are widely used in public address systems, megaphones, and sound systems for large venues like theaters, auditoriums, and sports stadiums. Their disadvantage is that their frequency response is more uneven because of resonance peaks, and horns have <b>a</b> <b>cutoff</b> frequency below which their response drops off. To achieve adequate response at bass frequencies horn speakers must be very large and cumbersome, so they are more often used for midrange and high frequencies. The first practical loudspeakers, introduced {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, were horn speakers. Due to the development in recent decades of cone loudspeakers which have a flatter frequency response, and the availability of inexpensive amplifier power, the use of horn speakers in high fidelity audio systems over the last decades has declined.|$|E

SR-17 also included SR-16 from Hurricane north to La Verkin Junction and southeast to Big Plain Junction, where the realigned SR-16 turned north to SR-15 at Rockville.

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{processing}} parameters for vocoded signals {{may have an}} important effect {{on the availability of}} various auditory features.

Performance was better with <b>a</b> high <b>cutoff</b> for sine-vocoding, with no effect of cutoff for noise-vocoding. With <b>a</b> low <b>cutoff,</b> performance was better for noise-vocoding than for sine-vocoding. With <b>a</b> high <b>cutoff,</b> performance was better for sine-vocoding. Experiment 2 measured perceptibility of cues to voice pitch variations. A noise carrier combined with <b>a</b> high <b>cutoff</b> allowed intonation to be perceived to some degree but performance was best in high-cutoff sine conditions. <b>A</b> low <b>cutoff</b> led to poorest performance, regardless of carrier. Experiment 3 tested the relative contributions of comodulation across bands and spectral density to improved performance with a sine carrier and high cutoff. Comodulation across bands had no effect so it appears that sidebands providing a denser spectrum improved performance. These results indicate that carrier type in combination with envelope cutoff can alter the available cues in vocoded speech, factors which must be considered in interpreting results with vocoded signals...|$|R
