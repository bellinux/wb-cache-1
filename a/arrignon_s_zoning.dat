40|$|The built {{environment}} {{is part of}} the physical environment made by people and for people. Because the {{built environment}} is such a ubiquitous component of the environment, it acts as an important pathway in determining health outcomes. Zoning, a type of urban planning policy, {{is one of the most}} important mechanisms connecting the built environment to public health. This policy analysis research paper explores how zoning regulations in Austin, Texas promote or prohibit the development of a healthy built environment. A systematic literature review was obtained from Active Living Research, which contained literature published about the relationships between the built environment, physical activity, and health. The results of these studies identified the following four components of the built environment that were associated to health: access to recreational facilities, sprawl and residential density, land use mix, and sidewalks and their walkability. A hierarchy analysis was then performed to demonstrate the association between these aspects of the built environment and health outcomes such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and general health. Once these associations had been established, the components of the built environment were adapted into the evaluation criteria used to conduct a public health analysis of Austin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>zoning</b> ordinance. A total of eighty-eight regulations were identified to be related to these components and their varying associations to human health. Eight regulations were projected to have a negative association to health, three would have both a positive and negative association simultaneously, and nine were indeterminable with the information obtained through the literature review. The remaining sixty-eight regulations were projected to be associated in a beneficial manner to human health. Therefore, it was concluded that Austin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>zoning</b> ordinance would have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the public 2 ̆ 7 s health based on identified associations between the built environment and health outcomes. ...|$|R

These policies provide the context for the current discussion of parking regulations in the region. • The experiences of two close-in Portland neighborhoods are discussed in section two. Parking is not regulated by the city zoning code in these neighborhoods.

40|$|Both {{long term}} and more recent socioeconomic, demographic, and {{cultural}} shifts {{have led to}} changing household formation patterns. Alongside a rise in living alone and adult children remaining in their parental homes have been increases in doubled-up or more-than-one-family households and non-family households. However, U. <b>S.</b> <b>zoning</b> codes and housing markets have long favored single-family homes and living arrangements. Have cities adapted to changing household trends? If so, how? Whether they have or not, what influences their responses? This thesis addresses these questions through a qualitative analysis of the occupancy standards- specifically family or household definitions, limits on the numbers of unrelated people in a single-family dwelling, and spatial requirements [...] of twenty-four {{cities across the country}} and deeper analysis of selected case studies. The findings show a range in approaches to relationship-based occupancy standards that indicate some acknowledgement of different household structures, but most codes still favor traditional families defined by blood, marriage, or adoption. Both relationship- and space-based occupancy standards are often supported for health and safety reasons or to "maintain neighborhood character," but these reasons and the typically selective enforcement of these codes often favor wealthier homeowners or have exclusionary intents and impacts. The discrepancies between occupancy standards and household trends have important implications for the form, availability, and affordability of the current and future housing stock, neighborhood dynamics, and the housing security of households in cities nationwide. I argue that planners {{need to be aware of}} and resist the normative biases and assumptions about families and homes ingrained in most zoning codes and offer recommendations for planning practice with regards to occupancy standards for single-family dwellings that support more flexible, equitable, and inclusive communities. by Amarillys Rodriguez.

40|$|Should {{religious}} landowners enjoy special {{protection from}} eminent domain? A recent federal statute, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA), compels courts {{to apply a}} compelling interest test to zoning and land marking regulations that substantially burden religiously owned property. That provision has been controversial in itself, but today a new cutting-edge issue is emerging: whether the Act 2 ̆ 7 s extraordinary protection should extend to condemnation as well. The matter has taken on added significance {{in the wake of}} Kelo, where the Supreme Court reaffirmed its expansive view of the eminent domain power. In this Article, we argue that RLUIPA should not give religious assemblies any extraordinary ability to resist condemnation. We offer two principal reasons for this proposal. First, the political economy surrounding condemnation is markedly different from that of zoning, so that broadening the law 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> protections beyond <b>zoning</b> to cover outright takings would be unnecessary and ineffective. Second, the costs of presumptively exempting congregations from condemnation are likely to be far higher than the costs of doing so with respect to zoning. In conclusion, we identify an important implication of our argument for the law 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> core <b>zoning</b> provision — namely, our proposal invites local governments to circumvent RLUIPA by simply condemning religious property that they find difficult to zone because of the Act. On the one hand, this gives local governments a needed safety valve while, on the other hand, requiring them to pay just compensation to religious groups. Our proposal therefore suggests a powerful compromise. Reprinted by permission of the publisher...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an urban}} environmental {{history of the}} low-lying American slum. Using qualitative research methods, I investigate the historical phenomenon of topographically based, socio-economic segregation in cities, and how urban actors first created these places then remade them. I examine six low-lying urban neighborhoods in the United States: "The Bottoms" in Columbus, Ohio; "Frog Hollow" in Hartford, Connecticut; "The Flats" in Los Angeles, California; "Black Bottom" in Nashville, Tennessee; "Swede Hollow" in St. Paul, Minnesota; and, "Foggy Bottom" in Washington, D. C. The {{first part of the}} thesis examines how land and factory owners, real estate developers, and speculators made urban lowlands into residential districts nicknamed bottoms, hollows, and flats beginning in the late nineteenth century. I argue that the deliberately incomplete implementation of urban interventions such as sewerage, water supply, and flood protection created interstitial spaces for stigmatized residence. Considered potentially threatening strangers, foreign immigrants, black migrants, and poor country whites were forced down into the lowlands, which functioned as containment zones within the internal structure of the city. The second part of the thesis details three modes of remaking the lowlands: slum clearance, zoning, and big projects. Late nineteenth century attempts to remove residents and eliminate slums encountered resistance from voters and city officials due to concerns that displaced undesirables would move into their city spaces. By the 1920 <b>s,</b> <b>zoning</b> helped to ease middle and upper class fears of invasion by promulgating rules to protect neighborhoods of single-family homes. After 1937, the federal government funded resident removal and physical redevelopment through public housing, highways, and the urban renewal program, erasing the old lowland slums. The history of urban lowlands highlights the low-lying landscape as an urban nexus point, revealing an inherent conflict between urban actors over containment of the poor versus the redevelopment of stigmatized districts. Planners intervene in this conflict, and assist in the repeated remaking of desirable and undesirable city spaces. The thesis draws connections among physical planning, social inequality, natural processes, and urban space in lowlands of unique interest to scholars and practicing planners in an era of renewed interest in the environment of cities. by Steven Thomas Moga.

These features were developed through literature and interview surveys and are described in a SWOT analysis, identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats as existing and future advantages and disadvantages related to transit-oriented development. Some of the more compelling strengths include a municipal reputation for attracting planning grants for large-scale projects to improve the district; a competitive location efficiency in the historic business district, the area 2 ̆ 7 s accommodation for multimodal service - particularly pedestrian and transit traffic, and national trends correlating the city 2 ̆ 7 s demographic profile to transit ridership support. With little expectation for change, all of these features should translate to the near future in Holyoke. Challenges cited in this report include bus-based transit-oriented development 2 ̆ 7 s unproven and unfamiliar reputation with stakeholders in the Pioneer Valley, the rustbelt community 2 ̆ 7 s tough-luck image in the development community, lagging leadership for the planning technique from state and regional planning officials, the City 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>zoning</b> regulations that oblige a suburban development model, and excessive parking that presently challenges a comfortable pedesrian environment. These challenges have solutions. Opportunities discussed in this report speak to financing options typical to transit-oriented development projects to generate a favorable reputation, ongoing strategies to increase and highlight the City 2 ̆ 7 s accomplishments, recommendations for zoning amendments to encourage pedestrian-friendly development, and popular methods to improve transit 2 ̆ 7 s viability as a competitive alternative to car use. Some issues are simply beyond the City 2 ̆ 7 s hands and will persist as threats to successsful downtown transit-oriented development. These issues include market hesitation to invest in transit-oriented development and Holyoke in general, a challenging reputation established for decades, and persistently lagging support from Beacon Hill for the unique issues confronting communities like Holyoke in the Pioneer Valley. Transit-oriented development presents a myriad of benefits and challenges for Holyoke and its stakeholders. Overall, the development technique offers compelling reasons for political and business leaders in Holyoke to adopt policies intended to realize its goals to create a vibrant, economically viable downtown district.

40|$|Summary. US cities capture public bene ® ts {{from private}} {{developers}} under several bargain ing frameworks: exaction <b>s,</b> incentive <b>zoning</b> and public ± private developments. These frameworks exist along {{a continuum of}} policy-in terven tion strategi es, from passive regu lation to active development, from {{a quid pro quo}} to incentive to investm ent policy posture. Each strategy de ® nes a public position, structure and process for negotiation and parameters for the bargain ing process. Though the means differ, the common element is that each strategy calls upon private development to support the costs of the public-bene ® t package. During the 1980 s, American cities succeed ed in tapping this wellspring of private development in an unparallelled way through active public development. To secure these bene ® ts, the policy strategy demanded that cities take on signi ® cantly greater risk to achieve their planning objectives.

40|$|This Master Plan is {{an update}} of {{planning}} related {{information for the}} Marshfield Planning Board. The first stage of any planning study is the gathering of background information and data on which proposals are based. Throughout the past year, information was collected and anaylzed concerning the following: population, employment, natural features, land use, vacant land, schools, recreation, water and sewer systems, traffic circulation, administrative services and the town 2 ̆ 7 s fiscal status. This information was collected in order to assist the Town and its citizens in their decisions regarding the future growth of Marshfield. The purpose of this Master Plan is to establish an updated guide for the continuing development of Marshfield. Thus this document is for everyone in Marshfield who is concerned with their community and its future. Marshfield is again at a crossroads, as the Town is facing difficult decisions concerning its future character. A debate {{has been going on}} {{over the last few years}} between those who advocate preservation of the Town 2 ̆ 7 s rural character and those who favor growth to strengthen the Town 2 ̆ 7 s economic base. In addition the need to create more housing opportunities has become apparent to the Town 2 ̆ 7 s officials. Marshfield has a housing affordability problem and under the present federal administration, economic factors will dictate that the Town has to work on solutions with little help. One of the methods which Marshfield itself can employ at little cost is changing portions of the Town 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Zoning</b> By-Laws. However, this is only a single facet to the problem, which requires a multi-faceted approach. This document promotes a balanced growth approach to the Town 2 ̆ 7 s future. Such an approach would provide the Town with the means to accommodate growth and development, while providing for the preservation of the Town 2 ̆ 7 s natural environment. The benefits of such an approach are many; it will provide the Town 2 ̆ 7 s officials a rational framework on which to base their decisions regarding development as opposed to a case-by-case response to each development proposal. Developers would be given a clear indication of public policy on how the development should proceed, enabling the developer to save time and money. Thus local growth can occur in a rational and orderly fashion thereby minimizing the fiscal impacts sometimes associated with poorly planned developments. The Town and its various departments, boards and citizens groups must work together and forge a common approach to Marshfield 2 ̆ 7 s future development. It is hoped that this plan is used as a guide in that effort. Essentially the Master Plan consists of the following sections; Natural Features, History, Land Use/Zoning, Demographics, Housing, Transportation, Economic Analysis, Financial Analysis, Public Services, Recreation, Conservation and a Public Policy Outline...|$|R

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{created by}} wind flow on low slope roofs {{is an issue}} addressed by many wind tunnel studies and selective field experimental studies. Building codes and standards specify pressure coefficient data to determine the wind loads for commercial roofing claddings. Field measurements can provide valuable data to validate the current code provisions for wind loads, as well provide supporting data for existing wind uplift test methods for roof claddings. Thus the Special Interest Group on Dynamic Evaluation of Roofing Systems (SIGDERS) selected four locations (Ottawa, Vancouver, Mt.

This paper presents the data collected from November 2012 to November 2013 from the Ottawa, Ontario site. Based on the National Building Code of Canada 5 ̆f 3 <b>s</b> (NBCC) <b>zoning</b> procedure, pressure taps were installed to obtain data for the corner, edge and field roof zones. Occurrences of wind speed exceeding 16 m s 2 ̆ 07 b 9 were considered for various wind directions. Peak and mean pressure coefficients were calculated and compared with NBCC (2010) 2 ̆ 019 s specifications. When instantaneous peak pressure coefficients were compared with the NBCC (2010), the measured data exceeded NBCC (2010) 2 ̆ 019 s specifications for some wind directions.

Two developments during the 19602 ̆ 7 <b>s,</b> the 1963 <b>zoning</b> ordinance and the construction of Route 290, evoked changes in its residential environment, thereby threatening its residential stability. These external factors have impacted the housing values and the dynamics of change.

As these land uses expand, there has been a decrease in the quality of the environmental characteristics resulting in a weakened desirability of this neighborhood as considered in locational decisions. Several theories offer interpretations of urban neighborhood change dynamics. The application of key concepts from the 2 ̆ 2 Arbitrage Model of Neighborhood Transition 2 ̆ 2 completes the assessment of the dynamics in this South Worcester neighborhood.

40|$|Background: Communities {{across the}} United States have been {{reforming}} their zoning codes to create pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods with increased street connectivity, mixed-use and higher density, open space, transportation infrastructure, and a traditional neighborhood structure. Zoning code reforms include new urbanist zoning {{such as the}} SmartCode, form-based codes, transects, transportation and pedestrian-oriented developments, and traditional neighborhood developments. Purpose: To examine the relationship of zoning code reforms and more active living-oriented zoning provisions with adult active travel to work via walking, biking, or by using public transit. Methods: Zoning codes effective as of 2010 were compiled for 3, 914 municipal-level jurisdictions located in 471 counties and 2 consolidated cities in 48 states and the District of Columbia, and that collectively covered 72. 9 % of the U. <b>S.</b> population. <b>Zoning</b> codes were evaluated {{for the presence of}} code reform zoning and nine pedestrian-oriented zoning provisions (1 =yes) : sidewalks, crosswalks, bike-pedestrian connectivity, street connectivity, bike lanes, bike parking, bike-pedestrian trails/paths, mixed use development, and other walkability/pedestrian-orientation. A zoning scale reflected the number of provisions addressed (out of 10). Five continuous outcome measures were constructed using 2010 - 2014 American Community Survey municipal-level 5 -year estimates to assess the percentage of workers: walking, biking, walking or biking, or taking public transit to work OR engaged in any active travel to work. Regression models controlled for municipal-level socioeconomic characteristics and a GIS-constructed walkability scale and were clustered on county with robust standard errors. Results: Adjusted models indicated that several pedestrian-oriented zoning provisions were statistically associated (p<. 05 or lower) with increased rates of walking, biking, or engaging in any active travel (walking, biking, or any active travel) to work: code reform zoning, bike parking (street furniture), bike lanes, bike-pedestrian trails/paths, other walkability, mixed use zoning, and a higher score on the zoning scale. Public transit use was associated with code reform zoning and a number of zoning measures in Southern jurisdictions but not in non-Southern jurisdictions. Conclusion: As jurisdictions revisit their zoning and land use policies, they may want to evaluate the pedestrian-orientation of their zoning codes so that they can plan for pedestrian improvements that will help to encourage active travel to work...|$|R
40|$|Contextual zoning is a {{planning}} tool used to preserve neighborhood character and promote desirable development. It has increasingly {{been applied to}} the distinctive historic neighborhoods of New York City to ensure a visual relationship between new development and the surrounding built environment. As a zoning device, this approach {{is rooted in the}} domain of urban planning, having been conceived in New York City by the Department of City Planning (DCP) in the 1980 s. While historic districts have been the traditional approach to preserving the character of neighborhoods since the 1960 <b>s,</b> contextual <b>zoning</b> offers an additional route to the preservation of neighborhood character. The conditions and effects of this strategy remain unstudied and this research seeks to fill that gap through a study of neighborhoods where contextual zoning has been applied in New York City both as an alternative to and in conjunction with historic district regulation. This thesis seeks to answer the following questions: how does contextual zoning currently function as a de facto preservation planning strategy in New York City? Does the broad level preservation it fosters, with its focus more on scale and siting of new buildings rather than integrity of old ones, provide a useful alternate strategy to pursue beyond traditional historic districts? How well does it perform producing new buildings that are visually compatible with existing neighborhood character? In other words, is contextual zoning actually contextual? To answer these questions, this thesis examines four neighborhoods, focused on the rowhouse districts of Brooklyn, where both historic districts and contextual zoning have been applied. The goal of this research is to understand the evolution of these two land use tools in a place-based context and to construct a narrative which discusses the ways in which contextual zoning functions as an alternative preservation strategy, the factors that have contributed to the use of contextual zoning in particular neighborhoods, and perceptions of successful outcomes of contextual zoning. A series of stakeholder interviews with city officials and neighborhood activists to understand the motivations for the application of contextual zoning from both perspectives, as well as a review of city documents and newspaper articles {{from the time of the}} rezonings, forms the basis for this narrative. By tracing the application this zoning mechanism in four neighborhoods, this thesis codifies the functions of contextual zoning with respect to historic preservation in New York City, and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this approach as compared to the traditional strategy of historic district designation...|$|R

Some have studied European influences stemming from late nineteenth century regulations and the urban design principles imported from the great cities of the era. Others know about the catastrophic London fire of 1666 and how it transformed society 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of why individual property rights, to some degree, must be subject to the greater public interest when common challenges are faced. For most of us, however, the trail beyond these few foreign precedents grows faint. Our investigations focus on what has happened within our own federal system. Land use studies, particularly in law schools, pick up the story {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century and trace the evolution of Euclidian zoning through the postwar building boom and then to the invention of neo-Euclidian land use controls needed to address the critical issues of the day: parochialism, pollution, exclusion, sprawl, and the fragmentation of a complex system of federal, state, and local laws. These issues, like the London fire, have ignited fierce battles over the extent to which private rights and the private sector should be regulated, the competence of government to direct market forces, the proper role of municipal, state, and federal agencies in land use regulation, and the appropriate legal techniques that government should employ to protect the public interest...|$|R

The cases were selected from case abstracts contained in two U. S. Supreme Court digests. The author relied on the court reporter 2 ̆ 7 s arrangement of abstracts of case decisions (sorted by substantive areas of the law) to identify relevant cases presenting issues of parent -child and husband-wife relations. The following substantive areas were initially selected using this method: abortion, adultery and fornication, adoption, immigration, exclusion and deportation, bigamy, bastards, dower, death, domicil, divorce and separation, guardian and ward, homestead, husband and wife, incompetent persons, infants, kidnapping, indecency, lewdness and obscenity, marriage, privacy, poor and poor laws, torts, schools, social security and unemployment compensation, wills, workman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> compensation, and <b>zoning.</b> Substantive areas receiving one or none citations of social science (in the summary tabulations) were excluded, leaving the parent-child areas of abortion, bastards, infants, obscenity, poor and poor laws, schools and social security. The above exclusion process left the husband-wife areas of adultery and fornication, bigamy, divorce and separation, husband and wife, and marriage. The entire text and footnotes were analyzed in the selected cases. The date of the decision, use or non-use of social science research, and the nature or discipline of the research were recorded and tabulated. The substantive caselaw of schools and obscenity were the substantive areas containing the most frequent citations of social science. The study revealed a general trend consistent with Christensen 2 ̆ 7 s (1964) model of family research development. Parent-child opinions revealed a general utilization rate of four per cent. The study revealed that history and economics, as social science disciplines, have been cited more frequently by the Supreme Court during the period analyzed than the social science disciplines of sociology and psychology...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Nearly half of {{the land}} areas of many U. <b>S.</b> cities is <b>zoned</b> for single family residences (e. g., 49 % of Seattle). These are {{fragmented}} management landscapes [...] large numbers of parcels are individually managed yet collectively comprise substantial portions of local ecosystems. Promoting the health of urban ecosystems therefore requires engagement with owners of these properties. I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with Seattle homeowners to understand the benefits for which they manage their properties. What motivates their engagement with ecosystem services derived from their properties? What {{are some of the}} salient values homeowners attribute to their properties that can be leveraged to promote pro-environmental management? To answer these questions, I analyzed these interviews using an ecosystem services framework and Schwartz’ basic individual values. I discovered that these homeowners have a range of motivations for engaging with the ecosystem services derived from their properties, not all of which are obviously a part of the basic nature of the service itself. Motivations appearing most consistently included those associated with in-group well-being (e. g., providing a healthy environment for one's own children, or building relationships through collaborative gardening), personal stability and security (e. g., feeling a sense of place, or perceiving neighborhood safety), and connection with nature (e. g., feeling at home in the landscape, or creating habitat for other organisms). The fact that any given ecosystem service may be used to address multiple motivational goals suggests that service assessments may be more robust when these goals are considered. Furthermore, urban homeowners may be more responsive to behavioral appeals that highlight opportunities to care for in-group members, to feel secure in one’s immediate environment, and to personally connect with nature...|$|R
40|$|The question, whether crustal domains are {{allochthonous}} terranes or not {{is crucial}} for plate tectonic models of the Ibero-Armorican segment of the Variscan belt. The Léon Domain in the Armorican Massif appears as a displaced crustal block as it bears a resemblance to the South Armorican Domain of the internal Variscan belt (Le Corre et al. 1989). In {{the central part of}} the Léon, the amphibolite-facies Conquet- Penze Micaschist Unit (CPMU) overlies the high-grade Lesneven Gneiss Unit (LGU). At the base of the LGU, a high-pressure stage at 700 °C/> 13 kbar, recorded by garnet-clinopyroxene assemblages in eclogites was followed by a high-temperature event at 800 °C/ 8 kbar with garnet and cordierite in aluminous paragneisses. Maximal temperatures in the upper parts of the LGU were 630 °C/ 6 kbar. In the micaschists of the Conquet-Penze Unit, microstructures indicate a crystallization of garnet and then staurolite during the development of S 1 and <b>S</b> 2 foliations. <b>Zoned</b> garnet in assemblages with staurolite recorded prograde P–T paths from 490 – 610 °C at 5 – 8 kbar in the upper and at 6 – 9 kbar in the lower parts of the CPMU. The foliation S 2 was overprinted by shear bands with a top-to- SW directed normal sense of shear, corresponding to a dextral strike-slip movement (Balé & Brun 1986). A younger population of monazite with variable Y contents displays Variscan Th-U-Pb ages (EMP dating method) between 340 and 300 Ma. In contrast, an older population of Cadomian monazite at 552 – 517 Ma is uniformly rich in Y and was observed in samples with only few or even no garnet. As the 330 – 340 Ma Saint Renan- Kersaint granite postdates the foliations S 1 and S 2 with peak metamorphic assemblages one can conclude that 340 – 300 Ma Variscan monazites should postdate garnet crystallization...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to Jamie France 2 ̆ 7 s note, 2 ̆ 2 A Proposed Solar Access Law for the State of Texas, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Bronin urges future commentators {{to focus on}} three additional areas of inquiry related to proposed solar rights regimes. Bronin argues that such proposals would be strengthened by discussion of potential legal challenges to the proposals, related political issues, and renewable energy microgrids. Ms. France’s proposal for the State of Texas includes the elimination of preexisting private property restrictions that negatively affect solar access. Bronin argues that this proposal would be strengthened by a discussion of potential challenges under federal and state takings clauses. Additionally, Ms. France 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> suggestion that <b>zoning</b> ordinances protect homeowners 2 ̆ 7 solar access would benefit from a discussion of challenges that might be raised by home rule cities in Texas. Furthermore, to provide a full perspective, a discussion of possible alternative rules for Houston, which lacks a zoning ordinance, might add to Ms. France 2 ̆ 7 s proposal, according to Bronin. Bronin also emphasizes that proposals for solar rights regimes, {{such as that of}} Ms. France, often affect various interest groups, and commentators should address the political issues that this creates. Specifically, in discussing Ms. France 2 ̆ 7 s proposal for the State of Texas, Bronin identifies the lack of political support for small-scale renewable energy installations as opposed to large-scale projects, Texas 2 ̆ 7 s current budget shortfall, and powerful interests groups that are affected by the proposal. Finally, Bronin encourages other commentators to consider advocating for renewable energy microgrids. Bronin has described these as 2 ̆ 2 small-scale, low-voltage distributed generation between neighbors for energy derived from sources such as solar collectors, wind power systems, microturbines, geothermal wells, and fuel cells, which have minimal negative impact on the environment. 2 ̆ 2 Bronin believes that renewable energy microgrids 2 ̆ 2 should be a key part of solar access regimes in any state. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Most of the petrologic data {{available}} for Type B inclusions comes from Type B 1 s. Relatively little {{comes from the}} B 2 s, and {{there has not been}} a systematic comparison of the properties of their two most abundant minerals. In this work, we document the compositions and zoning patterns of melilite and fassaite in Type B 2 inclusions, and compare and contrast them with the features of their counterparts in Type B 1 inclusions. We find that melilite compositions in Type B 2 inclusions are similar to those of Type B 1 s, with maximum Åk contents of 75 mol % and a positive correlation between Åk and Na 2 O contents. Asymmetrically zoned melilite is common in Type B 2 s as are melilite grains with reversely zoned regions, and the reversely zoned portions of crystals are thicker than in B 1 s. In B 2 s, like B 1 <b>s,</b> fassaite is <b>zoned</b> with decreasing Ti, Sc, and V oxide contents from cores to rims of grains. Approximately half of the Ti is trivalent, but unlike that in B 1 s, within fassaite grains in B 2 s the Ti 3 +/(Ti 3 + + Ti 4 +) ratio does not decrease from core to rim, and sharp enrich-ments (‘‘spikes’’) in Ti 3 + and V are not observed. Sector-zoned fassaite is much more common in B 2 s than in B 1 s. The differences we observed can be accounted for by the differences in bulk compositions between B 1 s and B 2 s. Type B 2 inclusions tend to have higher SiO 2 contents, hence higher An/Ge component ratios, than Type B 1 s. Phase equilibria show that, compared to B 1 s, in B 2 s less melilite should crystallize prior to the appearance of fassaite, so that in B 2 s a higher proportion of melilite cocrystallizes with fassaite, causing more of the crystals to be reversely zoned; more melilite crystallizes while adjacent to other crystals, leading to asymmetrical zoning; and with more liquid available, transport of components to growing fassaite occurs more readily than in B 1 s, facilitating crystal growth an...|$|R
40|$|Compositional zoning and {{dissolution}} in cement is {{a direct}} response to the fluctuation of pore water chemistry, the variation of which during burial can be controlled by many factors, including the interaction between pore water and rock-forming minerals and the mixing of fluids from different origins. This paper suggests that tectonic activity can, by altering the hydraulic gradient, also influence pore water chemistry and lead to dissolution of cement, made clear by zoning within siderite crystals. Three different stages of siderite cement have been described from the Tirrawarra Sandstone in the Moorari and Fly Lake fields of the southern Cooper Basin, here referred to as S 1 (early), S 2 (middle), and S 3 (late). Ragged dissolution surfaces separate the main phases, occurring after precipitation of S 1 and S 2 with incipient dissolution suggested within S 2. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images and electron microprobe analyses clearly differentiate each main phase of siderite. S 1 is a homogeneous, iron-rich siderite whereas S 2 displays patchy compositional zoning associated with several minor dissolution stages, and S 3 commences with even compositional banding and grades into a thick homogeneous phase {{in the terms of}} composition. Isotope analyses and fluid inclusion studies indicate that S 1 formed at a temperature around 30 degrees celsius, S 2 precipitated at a minimum temperature of 68 degrees celsius, and S 3 formed around 102 degrees celsius. The heterogeneous, pitted and <b>zoned</b> <b>S</b> 2 is thought to have formed during a time of active tectonism in the Cooper basin, whereas the evenly banded nature of S 3 suggests that it precipitated during a quiet tectonic period when pore waters largely remained relatively constant. It appears that siderite cements in the Tirrawarra Sandstone record tectonic activity in the form of irregular growth and dissolution highlighted by compositional zoning with stages of strong dissolution recording particularly active times when pore waters changed composition dramatically. Some zoning could be related in part to tectonic pulses. The temperature recorded by each of the siderite stages allows their precipitation to be tied to a burial history curve, and by making some simple assumptions about that history, the timing of cementation can be estimated. This can be a additional tool for calibrating the thermal history of an area...|$|R
40|$|Urban form is {{the product}} of the actions of a {{multitude}} of actors, from governments to individuals, from corporations to activist organizations. It is the result of rules, ideas, assumptions,and arguments, all of which accumulate and evolve over many years. Among these many paths of influence, urban form is the outcome of state policy, including the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In turn, state policy is a product of multiple objectives and is shaped, often indirectly,by shared ideas about urban form. In order to understand the ways in which policy and form are intertwined, this thesis explores the influence of ideas about urban form on three recent state laws in Massachusetts: the Community Preservation Act from 2000, 40 R/ 40 <b>S</b> (Smart Growth <b>Zoning</b> and Housing Production) from 2004 and 2005, and landlocked tidelands legislation from 2007. Each law has plausibly significant impacts on urban form, but urban form is not the driving factor in any of these cases. In each case study, rhetoric of urban form emerged indirectly in the discussions about the legislation. The prevalence of this rhetoric indicates that it was essential that the legislation be consistent with shared conceptions of the urban forms native to Massachusetts. These ideas of vernacular form are dominated by the idea of New England village, but also include a secondary urban vernacular that is applied to select urban locations. Each piece of legislation had to be consistent enough with an idea of vernacular urban form so that it could be presented and advocated in terms of the vernacular. (cont) Chapter three explores the variety of paths along which ideas of the vernacular form operate in each case study. This analysis of the ways that ideas about urban form shape state legislation suggests lessons that could improve the physical setting of the Commonwealth. Ultimately, the lessons have the potential to positively influence the lives of the Commonwealth's inhabitants, workers, and visitors. by Benjamin P. Solomon-Schwartz. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} law and {{economics}} has not {{come to grips with}} Arrow's limitation on social welfare economics nor with the evolutionary character of economic and legal institutions. Arrow's theorem makes the concept of a socially efficient economic institution dependent on a prior allocation of property rights. A socially efficient result is efficient only within the bounds of the initial allocation of property rights. A differing initial allocation would have resulted in a different efficient result. The participants in economic and legal systems are aware of this fact. They see that their positions can be improved both by market trades and by adjustments to property rights. This fact is the engine by which evolutionary law and economic change occurs. Furthermore, evolutionary {{law and economics}} has not recognized the fundamentally complex nature of evolution. Contrary to early arguments in law and economics, institutions do not evolve toward efficiency. They do not evolve toward a single point of any kind. Instead, they evolve in a complex and partially unpredictable way; driven by the actions of numerous participants and subject to path dependency and other evolutionary phenomena. The ideas that legal institutions form in an evolutionary manner and that social efficiency is a weak concept have been well-argued in the literature (for reviews see Barry 1991, Samuels 1991). However, the modern development of evolutionary economics has provided tools and metaphors that can strengthen the presentation (Roe 1996). 1 have chosen zoning as my illustration {{in part because of the}} numerous attempts by economists to analyze its efficiency and in part because it provides a compelling illustration of the evolutionary view. This paper first discusses welfare economics and Arrow's theorem. It argues that the persistent focus on social efficiency is misguided and misleading. It is misguided because of its ignorance of the allocation issue; misleading because of its willingness to voice policy conclusions. The paper goes on to discuss evolutionary thought as an alternative to the traditional view. Finally, the paper recounts the development of zoning law as an illustration of the evolutionary phenomena that aggregate welfare economics overlooks.
