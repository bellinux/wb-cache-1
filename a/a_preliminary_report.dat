5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>report</b> in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its parental species, A.bradleyi hybridizes with several other spleenworts. Its hybrid with A.pinnatifidum was recognized as such by William R. Maxon in 1918. He named it A.gravesii for its discoverer, Edward W. Graves. It can also backcross with its parental species. Wherry collected specimens of A.bradleyi ×montanum from a cliff near Blairstown, New Jersey in 1935. It is not {{thought to have been}} collected again until 1961, when it was described and named in Wherry's honor. Specimens believed to be A.bradleyi ×platyneuron were collected at an early date at McCall's Ferry, along the Susquehanna River. The site of collection was submerged by the building of the Holtwood Dam. <b>A</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>report</b> of both diploid A.bradleyi and A.bradleyi ×platyneuron from Sequatchie County, Tennessee was made in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>report</b> on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E

5|$|On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' {{claims to}} have never sold data, a former {{employee}} of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to Cigna and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices. Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years. Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired {{at the end of}} July 2010. Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner.

Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish <b>a</b> <b>preliminary</b> <b>report</b> on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence for companies to sell personal data.|$|E
