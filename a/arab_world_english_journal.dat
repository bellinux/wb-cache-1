50|$|Darf Publishers is an {{independent}} British publishing house established in London in 1980 focusing on publishing books on the Middle East, North Africa and the <b>Arab</b> <b>World</b> in <b>English.</b> Initially, most of Darf's books were facsimile editions of rare 18th and 19th century books, covering topics such as history, sociology, literature and languages, culture, and sport.|$|R

40|$|The study aims {{to answer}} the {{question}} about the durability of linguistic globalization and its consequences in the <b>Arab</b> <b>world.</b> The issue is discussed {{in the context of the}} spread of Global English in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. The analysis shows that English has become the most important form of linguistic capital at the expense of Standard Arabic. We claim that the process will proceed due to strong clas stratification in the <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> where <b>English</b> - being an attribute of the upper and middle-upper class - is used to perpetuate social inequalities, and the linguistic dichotomy between Standard Arabic and vernaculars...|$|R

30|$|Investigation on the {{language}} of published documents from <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> showed that <b>English</b> language was the prevalent. The use of English as an international language of science is by now well documented (Tardy 2004), and nearly 85 % of all research output and technological information {{in the world today}} are written and/or abstracted in English (Ammon 2001). Since English language is widely accepted as {{the language}} of science and technology, Arab researchers tend to use it to gain international credibility (Atwell et al. 2009). The Arab League Educational, Social and Cultural Organization conducted an initiative to run workshops where cutting-edge science and research are reported in Arabic, as a result, the proceedings begin to be inaccessible to most of English-speaking community (Atwell et al. 2009).|$|R
