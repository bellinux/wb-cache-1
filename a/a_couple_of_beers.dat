500|$|The {{album was}} the Fall's first to include Karl Burns and Paul Hanley in the band's classic two-drummer lineup.

The earlier single [...] "Look, Know" [...] was recorded during the Icelandic sessions but not included on the album. This was characteristic of Smith's [...] "never look back" [...] approach.|$|E
500|$|When {{recording}} Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too, Alexander {{stated that}} he [...] "completely ripped up the rules that applied to [...] first two records." [...] While the album was credited to the New Radicals, it is often {{considered to be a}} Gregg Alexander album, as he wrote and produced most of its songs, played several instruments on it, and is the only constant member of the band. In reference to the wide variety of musicians he recruited to record the album, Alexander stated, [...] "Most of that record was me pulling favors with studios or musicians that had played on earlier records and were like, 'Oh, Gregg's down on his luck — let's go play on his demo for the hell of it, we'll have a good laugh, have <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers</b> and maybe smoke a jay or whatever.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Singer Richard Butler {{recalled}} Steve Lillywhite's {{directions to}} him regarding the vocals: [...] "He told me, 'Go {{down to the}} pub, have <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers,</b> and when you come back, I want you to sing like it's three in the morning, and you're talking on the telephone to someone'". According to Butler, the lyrics conveyed sadness over his then-girlfriend moving away, and were written using imagery, [...] "instead of saying 'My bird's gone to Italy and I miss her'".|$|E

He became even genial, his looks were kindly, and our voices mellowed together as we talked water-front and oyster-bed gossip.|$|R
6000|$|Another young gentleman {{friend of}} mine--for I am bound {{to admit it}} was youth that profited most by the advice and counsel of The Amateur: I suppose as one grows older one grows less daring, less industrious--made a rocking-chair, {{according}} to the instructions of this book, out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> barrels. From every practical point of view {{it was a bad}} rocking-chair. It rocked too much, and it rocked in too many directions at one and the same time. I take it, a man sitting on a rocking-chair {{does not want to be}} continually rocking. There comes a time when he says to himself--"Now I have rocked sufficiently for the present; now I will sit still for a while, lest a worse thing befall me." [...] But this was one of those headstrong rocking-chairs that are a danger to humanity, and a nuisance to themselves. Its notion was that it was made to rock, and that when it was not rocking, it was wasting its time. Once started nothing could stop it--nothing ever did stop it, until it found itself topsy turvy on its own occupant. That was the only thing that ever sobered it.|$|R

Originally, the beer was called Alltid oavsett ("always, no matter what"), which is a slogan often used by supporters of Djurgårdens IF. The beer is a pale lager of 5.0% abv made by Grebbestad Bryggeri on behalf of Djurgårdshjälpen and is not part of Grebbestad Bryggeri's own range of beers.|$|E
5000|$|The Roseto {{effect is}} the {{phenomenon}} {{by which a}} close-knit community experiences a reduced rate of heart disease. The effect is named for Roseto, Pennsylvania. The Roseto effect was first noticed in 1961 when the local Roseto doctor encountered Dr. Stewart Wolf, then head of Medicine of the University of Oklahoma, and they discussed, over <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers,</b> the unusually low rate of myocardial infarction in Roseto compared with other locations. [...] Many studies followed, including a 50-year study comparing nearby Bangor and Nazareth. As the original authors had predicted, as the Bangor cohort shed their Italian social structure and became more Americanized {{in the years following}} the initial study, heart disease rose.|$|E

The barman had determined that Sjödin was too drunk to be served, and called the bouncers to eject Sjödin and her friend.

6000|$|He met a {{man named}} Lawson, an old school-fellow, of whom history now knows only that he was red-faced and had a terrier. He and Holsten walked {{together}} and Holsten was sufficiently pale and jumpy for Lawson {{to tell him he}} overworked and needed a holiday. They sat down at a little table outside the County Council house of Golders Hill Park and sent one of the waiters to the Bull and Bush for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bottles <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> no doubt at Lawson's suggestion. The beer warmed Holsten's rather dehumanised system. He began to tell Lawson as clearly as he could to what his great discovery amounted. Lawson feigned attention, but indeed he had neither the knowledge nor the imagination to understand.

However, the original uploader of the viral video, Darren Ward, claims this is untrue and that he was simply filming Hill whilst {{under the influence of}} alcohol because he thought it was amusing. In an interview about the video Ward said: [...] "What happened was, we saw this bloke getting a bit rowdy at the football.

5000|$|Beer is not {{the most}} popular {{alcoholic}} beverage among North Koreans, who generally prefer the Korean liquor soju. As consequence, North Korean beer is still little known. Nevertheless, beer and soju are the two most common alcoholic drinks in the country, with 94.9 percent of all alcohol consumed (in pure alcohol) being liquor and the remaining 5.1 percent beer. An average North Korean consumes just under a liter of pure alcohol in the form of beer annually. Nevertheless, North Koreans are said to [...] "love a beer as much as Europeans or North Americans". According to Josh Thomas, an amateur brewer who has toured North Korean breweries: The average Pyongyang man drinks beer fairly frequently — at least once a week. People in the countryside drink less often, and some never at all. Beer culture is something still developing — it is mainly still men going to a bar after work, drinking <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers,</b> and then going home.|$|E
50|$|Beer, {{as in many}} countries, {{is popular}} {{at all levels of}} society.

A common beer drinking ritual among many Peruvian men involves a group sharing one glass. The party holding the bottle waits for the prior person to drink from the glass before receiving that glass, filling it and passing the bottle on to the next in line. While this custom is more common among men of lower echelons of society, people of higher social status, particularly youth and occasionally women, take part in this custom.|$|R

The title track dealt with a neighborhood in Detroit that was destroyed to make room for General Motors. Although such songs sound passionate and sincere, it's not what Iris' fans go to him for.

5000|$|In 2005, actor Bill Ward {{claimed that}} people {{approached}} him regarding the abuse his character gave to Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay).

[...] He also revealed that he [...] "had to be more wary" [...] about where he went since his character started his [...] "reign of terror", and that he’d had notes left on his car, which he found [...] "worrying and unnerving". Despite claiming some people condoned his behavior, {{he also said that}} some people told him to [...] "be nicer to that Shelley". Bill thought that his character was [...] "a shocking man who behaves abysmally", but that as an actor he had to [...] "justify everything he does".|$|E
5000|$|Perry has {{revealed}} that she was inspired to write the track after running naked through a park with her friends. According to Music Rooms, Perry claims that after a wild night of partying and streaking, she wrote the song about her antics and what she remembered the next day. Perry revealed: [...] "There's nothing better than an impromptu dance party with my friends. My track 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)' is a song about debauchery because I {{had one of those}} nights in Santa Barbara. We went out to this place called Wildcat and got crazy," [...] Perry admitted: [...] "We had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>beers</b> and danced until we died, then brought the party back to the hotel room." [...] She added: [...] "Most of that song is actual truth, apart from the ménage à trois..... unfortunately! But, yes, streaking in the park, that's what we did, so we had to write a song about it the next day!" [...] One of the friends in this trip was co-writer Bonnie McKee, who said the song encapsulated [...] "Katy and my wild drinking days" [...] from their younger days. McKee stated [...] "TGIF is pretty much a word for word description of our trip to Santa Barbara, so I love that one. It's really catchy and fun and makes me nostalgic." [...] The official artwork for [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] using scenes from the music video, shows Perry both before and after a makeover. She revealed the cover artwork for [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.) Remixes!" [...] on her Facebook page. The photo features Perry in nerdy gear, including mouth guard and glasses, and was taken when she hosted the Teen Choice Awards in summer 2010. The image is surrounded by 1980s-style neon colors and swirly graphics. A remixed version of [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)", featuring Missy Elliott, was released on August 8, 2011 to radio and as a digital download.

5000|$|The Maryland Crab Feast ("Crab Boil" [...] is not {{a phrase}} used in Maryland, as is in Louisiana) is a popular event for small groups of friends. Despite the name, the cooking {{technique}} is actually steaming. Crab pots have a raised bottom that keeps a fitted basket above the liquid. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> inches <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> (or water) mixed with vinegar is brought to a boil. The crabs are placed in the basket and sprinkled liberally with a seasoning mix (usually Old Bay), and then placed in the steamer. Twenty minutes later the bright red crabs are pulled up and turned out onto trays or platters. Tables are covered with layers of brown paper and wooden mallets and serrated knives are made available for cracking claws and picking out meat. Typical side dishes are cole slaw and corn on the cob.|$|R

Pittsburgh general manager, Branch Rickey, reinstated Werle on April 11, but the fine was not dropped. The incident which prompted the fine and suspension was not explained clearly. Werle understood that {{it had to do with}} his having been 30 minutes late, a violation of training rules. It was mentioned that he arrived at his hotel with roommate, George Metkovich, after seven innings of a night game in Beaumont, Texas. They had <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bottles <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> each, showered, and went downstairs. He denied a rumor of having a woman in his hotel room, which Rickey seemed to believe at first. Werle swore on his father's grave that this was untrue and 'that someone was a damned liar'.|$|R

60|$|Weeks had {{two little}} {{rooms at the}} back of Frau Erlin's house, and one of them, {{arranged}} as a parlour, was comfortable enough for him to invite people to sit in. After supper, urged perhaps by the impish humour which was the despair of his friends in Cambridge, Mass., he often asked Philip and Hayward to come in for a chat. He received them with elaborate courtesy and insisted on their sitting in the only two comfortable chairs in the room. Though he did not drink himself, with a politeness of which Philip recognised the irony, he put <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bottles <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> at Hayward's elbow, and he insisted on lighting matches whenever in the heat of argument Hayward's pipe went out. At the beginning of their acquaintance Hayward, as a member of so celebrated a university, had adopted a patronising attitude towards Weeks, who was a graduate of Harvard; and when by chance the conversation turned upon the Greek tragedians, a subject upon which Hayward felt he spoke with authority, he had assumed the air that it was his part to give information rather than to exchange ideas. Weeks had listened politely, with smiling modesty, till Hayward finished; then he asked one or two insidious questions, so innocent in appearance that Hayward, not seeing into what a quandary they led him, answered blandly; Weeks made a courteous objection, then a correction of fact, after that a quotation from some little known Latin commentator, then a reference to a German authority; and the fact was disclosed that he was a scholar. With smiling ease, apologetically, Weeks tore to pieces all that Hayward had said; with elaborate civility he displayed the superficiality of his attainments. He mocked him with gentle irony. Philip could not help seeing that Hayward looked a perfect fool, and Hayward had not the sense to hold his tongue; in his irritation, his self-assurance undaunted, he attempted to argue: he made wild statements and Weeks amicably corrected them; he reasoned falsely and Weeks proved that he was absurd: Weeks confessed that he had taught Greek Literature at Harvard. Hayward gave a laugh of scorn.|$|R
60|$|Of all my {{experiences}} this was, I think, the strangest, after that night of hell, {{to find myself}} alone upon this field of death, staring everywhere at the distorted faces which on the previous morn I had seen so full of life. Yet my physical needs asserted themselves. I was very hungry, who for twenty-four hours had eaten nothing, faint with hunger indeed. I passed a provision wagon that had been looted by the Zulus. Tins of bully beef lay about, also, among a wreck of broken glass, some bottles <b>of</b> Bass's <b>beer</b> which had escaped their notice. I found an assegai, cleaned it in the ground which it needed, and opening one of the tins, lay down in a tuft of grass by a dead man, or rather between him and some Zulus whom he had killed, and devoured its contents. Also I knocked the tops off <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beer</b> bottles and drank my fill. While I was doing this a large rough dog with a silver-mounted collar on its neck, I think {{of the sort that}} is called an Airedale terrier, came up to me whining.

Doubtless it had belonged to some dead officer, though there was no name on the collar. The poor beast, which I named Lost, at once attached itself to me, and here I may say that I kept it till its death, which occurred of jaundice at Durban not long before I started on my journey to King Solomon's Mines.
