5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} spandrels with warriors. <b>Art</b> <b>historians</b> are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.|$|E
5|$|The sitter is unknown, {{although}} some <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> have speculated on her identity. On {{the grounds of}} similarity of facial features, writer Wilhelm Stein suggested in the early 20th century {{that she might be}} Marie de Valengin, the illegitimate daughter of Philip the Good of Burgundy. However, this is a contentious assertion and not widely held. Because her hands are shown as resting on the painting's lower frame, <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> generally accept that this was an independent portrait, rather than a devotional work. It is possible that it was intended as a pendant to a picture of the woman's husband, however no other portrait has been suggested as a likely companion.|$|E
5|$|Both {{panel and}} frame {{are in good}} condition. That the panel retains its {{original}} frame makes it especially interesting to <b>art</b> <b>historians,</b> apart from its aesthetic qualities. The canvas has suffered little paint loss, board cracking, or other damage, and has been cleaned several times since it came into the possession of the Groeningemuseum.|$|E

5|$|The parapet {{has three}} {{horizontal}} rows of inscriptions; {{on the upper}} and lower rows is smaller lettering that is often not visible in reproductions.

5|$|Algorithmic {{analysis}} {{of images of}} artworks, for example using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, can reveal information about art.

5|$|<b>Art</b> <b>historians</b> {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which is lined with sheet iron or tiles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Art</b> <b>historians</b> have {{suggested}} completion dates {{ranging from the}} early 1440s to the early 1460s, with c. 1455 seen as probable.

5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. <b>Art</b> <b>historians</b> are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous peoples were {{producing}} art {{for thousands}} of years before the arrival of European settler colonists and the eventual establishment of Canada as a nation state.

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, scholars have debated whether El Greco's style had Byzantine origins.

5|$|The {{most popular}} {{subjects}} {{of this type}} include the Flight into Egypt and the plight of hermits such as Saints Jerome and Anthony. As well as connecting the style to the later Age of Discovery, the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and cartography, and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have {{questioned whether the}} diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures with the historical Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruisdael's trip to Germany, his landscapes {{took on a}} more heroic character, with forms {{becoming}} {{larger and}} more prominent. A view of Bentheim Castle, dated 1653, {{is just one of}} a dozen of Ruisdael's depictions of a particular castle in Germany, almost all of which pronounce its position on a hilltop. Significantly, Ruisdael made numerous changes to the castle's setting (it is actually on an unimposing low hill) culminating in a 1653 version which shows it on a wooded mountain. These variations are considered by <b>art</b> <b>historians</b> to be evidence of Ruisdael's compositional skills.|$|E
