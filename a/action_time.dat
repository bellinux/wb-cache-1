2500|$|Several {{scholars}} have previously discerned that {{some details of}} Azazel's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite. Thus, Lester Grabbe points {{to a number of}} parallels between the Azazel narrative in Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including [...] "the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land." [...] Daniel Stökl also observes that [...] "the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, <b>action,</b> <b>time</b> and purpose." [...] Thus, the place of Asael’s punishment designated in Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. Stökl remarks that [...] "the name of place of judgment (Dudael) is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin." ...|$|E

40|$|Algeria. In {{this paper}} we present durational <b>actions</b> <b>timed</b> automata, DATA*, as a sub class of timed automata. In the {{contrast}} of T. A, the underling semantic of DATA * is the maximality semantics which claim that actions have durations and true concurrency is captured differently from choice. DATA* model is in one hand useful for modeling and validating reel aspects of systems. In the other hand, it is determinizable and closed under all Boolean operations. As result, the language inclusion problem is decidable. Then, we compare a durational <b>actions</b> <b>timed</b> automata to event recording automata, which is a determinizable sub class of the classical timed automata. Next, we propose a simple framework to aggregate region of DATA * for reducing its space state. This study {{is based on an}} aggregation region automata procedure to reduce the combinatorial explosion of regions. Finally, we discuss equivalence and validation of systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>Time</b> <b>Action</b> Lock is a {{state of}} a Real-time system at which neither time can {{progress}} nor an <b>action</b> can occur. <b>Time</b> <b>Action</b> Locks are often seen as signs of errors in the model or inconsistencies in the specification. As a result, finding out and resolving <b>Time</b> <b>Action</b> Locks is a major task for the designers of Real-time systems. Verification is one of the methods of discovering deadlocks. However, due to state explosion, the verification of deadlock freeness is computationally expensive. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a computationally cheap testing method for Timed Automata models and pointing out any source of possible <b>Time</b> <b>Action</b> Locks to the designer. We have implemented the approach presented in the paper, which is based on the geometry of Timed Automata, via a Testing Tool called TALC (<b>Time</b> <b>Action</b> Lock Checker). TALC, which is used in the conjunction with the model checker UP-PAAL, tests the UPPAAL model and provides feedback to the designer. We have illustrated our method by applying TALC to a model of a simple communication protocol...|$|R
