Flashing red indicates that flows are very high and boats must not use the section.|$|E

5|$|Despite being quadrupedal the {{ring-tailed lemur}} can rear up and balance {{on its hind}} legs, usually for {{aggressive}} displays. When threatened the ring-tailed lemur may jump {{in the air and}} strike out with its short nails and sharp upper canine teeth in a behaviour termed jump fighting. This is extremely rare outside of the breeding season when tensions <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> competition for mates is intense. Other aggressive behaviours include a threat-stare, used to intimidate or start a fight, and a submissive gesture known as pulled-back lips.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when the charges <b>are</b> <b>high,</b> <b>and</b> {{the distance between}} the nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and thus have high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates <b>are</b> <b>high,</b> <b>and</b> life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, and {{in regions}} with poor hygiene standards, {{the rates of}} infection with this virus <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> the illness is usually contracted in early childhood. As incomes rise and access to clean water increases, the incidence of HAV decreases. In developed countries, though, the infection is contracted primarily by susceptible young adults, {{most of whom are}} infected with the virus during trips to countries with a high incidence of the disease or through contact with infectious persons.|$|E
25|$|Fertility rates. “Religions {{with many}} adherents in {{developing}} countries, where birth rates <b>are</b> <b>high,</b> <b>and</b> infant mortality rates generally have been falling, {{are likely to}} grow quickly.” Therefore, much {{of the growth of}} Christianity is projected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, Christians have a birth rate of 2.7 children per woman. But Muslims have a higher rate, namely, an average of 3.1 children per woman. This differential {{is one of the reasons}} that the Muslim population is growing faster than the Christian.|$|E
25|$|In stage one, pre-industrial society, {{death rates}} and birth rates <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> roughly in balance. All human populations are {{believed}} to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe. In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago. Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.|$|E

25|$|During reverse {{electron}} transfer, complex I {{might be}} the most important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, with up to 5% of electrons being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, the process by which electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or dihydro-oorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that it can be a very potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> oxaloacetate or malate concentrations are low.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its role as intermediate host for several economically important trematode species, Tarebia granifera has colonized water reservoirs, dams and ponds on the premises of three large industrial plants in northern KwaZulu-Natal and been pumped out {{of at least one}} of them, blocking water pipes and damaging equipment. This generally happens when snail densities <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> the damage is due to individuals being crushed so that pieces of shell and soft tissue are carried into machinery. Details of {{the nature and extent of}} this damage and the costs incurred are not available. There is no doubt that Tarebia granifera is able to pass unharmed through pumps, probably as juveniles.|$|E
25|$|Another {{aspect of}} life that {{includes}} the ideal of practicing honorable traditions includes the ceremony of getting married. Before Christianity, polygyny was widely practiced and a practice called bridewealth took place amongst the families of men and women. Bridewealth is the practice of offering livestock to the bride's family in exchange for her fertility. The practice of polygyny is still legal within the country, but many men marry only one woman as the idea of Christianity spreads throughout the country. Divorce rates <b>are</b> <b>high</b> <b>and</b> cohabitation before marriage is common in most homes. Even though many families are based on unmarried couples, marriage is still a highly important and open ceremony within the community.|$|E
