In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas.

Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
5|$|The {{genealogy}} of Ine and of {{the kings}} of Wessex is known from two sources: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List.

These are often <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> with the more extensive information in the Regnal List. The inconsistencies appear to result from the efforts of later chroniclers to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic, the founder, according to the Chronicle, of the West Saxon line in England.|$|E

According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> with that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} primary {{particle}} size distribution (PPSD) on nanoparticles aggregation in colloidal suspensions was investigated numerically by the discrete element model. The aggregate growth and structure in terms of fractal dimension, coordination number and the longest dimension, was examined. Final results show that <b>at</b> small PPSD <b>variances,</b> netlike structure was formed with aggregate branches interconnected in multiple locations, whereas <b>at</b> large <b>variances</b> aggregates with more compact structure and smaller longest dimension were generated. At broader PPSDs, particles assemble faster. The aggregate size distribution inversely appears broader <b>at</b> smaller PPSD <b>variances.</b> The 2 D fractal dimension of aggregates increased from 1. 46 to 1. 55 as PPSD variance increased from 20 to 80, indicating more compact aggregates were formed at broader PPSD. Larger PPSD variance leads to larger coordination number (CN), even though subtle discrepancy has been observed in the evolutional curves of CN. The aggregate size, both mass-equivalent aggregate size and the longest dimension longest dimension, increases as PPSD variances decreases. The predicted result is qualitatively in good agreement with the data published in literature...|$|R
