5|$|A ball {{is called}} when the pitcher throws <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> that {{is outside the}} strike zone, {{provided}} the batter has not swung at it.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pitch</b> {{that is not}} hit {{into the}} field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E

5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether the advance was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, the advance is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on the advance.|$|E

30|$|The {{encoding}} strategy {{followed for}} <b>a</b> <b>pitched</b> music note and an unpitched note is different. The encoding logic for an unpitched note is straightforward like a singleton entity.

5|$|Adams {{also worked}} {{occasionally}} as an umpire in significant games. One notable example {{was the final}} contest of a three-game series between all-star teams from Brooklyn and New York City, held on September 10, 1858, in Long Island. During the game, which the New York City all-stars won 29–18, Adams became the first umpire to use a new rule allowing for a strike to be called against a batter who did not swing at <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> in the strike zone. Previously, strikes were only called when a batter swung at <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> and missed. Three batters were ruled out on strikes called by Adams in the game. Otherwise, the called strike rule was not applied often in its {{first few years of}} existence.|$|E

5|$|On March 28, 2002, Mota hit Mike Piazza, catcher for the Mets at the time, with <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> in {{a spring}} {{training}} {{game against the}} Mets. After Mota {{was removed from the}} game, Piazza grabbed him by the neck and had to be separated from Mota by other players. Piazza received a $3,000 fine for his actions. Next season, in a spring training game against the Mets on March 12, Mota hit Piazza with <b>a</b> <b>pitch.</b> Piazza charged the mound, starting a brawl, and both players were ejected from the game. After the game, Piazza entered the Dodgers' clubhouse looking for Mota. Informed that Mota had left, Piazza searched the clubhouse before leaving. Mota said that hitting Piazza was not intentional, but both he and Piazza were suspended five games in the regular season and finedMota $1,500 and Piazza $3,000. Mota's suspension was later reduced to four games.|$|E

5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined <b>a</b> <b>pitch</b> from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
