Meanwhile, Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times wrote in her review of the song that [...] "in the grander scheme of x, 'Photograph' doesn't quite seem to line up lyrically", and noted {{that most of the}} album's songs explored [...] "the feelings of a lover scorned, cheating exes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the excess life".

500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process. Talking about {{the concept of the}} video, he stated [...] "I was just trying to connect or {{articulate}} visually the feeling of being numb. The feeling of wanting to feel something you can't feel. A lot of things can cause that numbing, but in the video it was some sort of topical aesthetic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> special effects." [...] The video doesn't last the entirety of the song, which director Nabil Elderkin stated was for artistic reasons.

[...] When asked if he made R music, Ocean replied that he disliked how that in the United States, [...] "if you're a singer and you're black, you're an R artist. Period." [...] Ocean stated that the songs on the mixtape do contain R influences, but that it is not an R album entirely.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Marrash {{composed}} many essays {{about science}} (especially mathematics), and about education, a subject which mattered {{a lot to}} him; indeed, he wrote in Ghabat al-haqq that [...] "without {{the education of the}} mind, man is a mindless beast". He also wrote many articles in the popular press; in those published in Butrus al-Bustani's journal al-Jinan, he showed himself favourable to women's education, which he restricted however to reading, writing, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> arithmetic, geography and grammar. In an 1872 issue of al-Jinan, he wrote that it is not necessary for a woman [...] "to act like a man, neglect her domestic and family duties, or that she should consider herself superior to the man"; he nonetheless closely followed his sister's studies. Marrash also condemned Arab men's severe treatment of their wives and daughters. In his later works, he tried to demonstrate the existence of God and of the divine law; the Sharia, as he conceived it, was not restricted to the sphere of the Islamic law alone.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. It was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter, who revealed that the concept was setting Spears and Madonna apart, hence Spears wore a black outfit whereas Madonna sported a white suit. Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was my first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to see the two different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together.

500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel questions about her singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go". According to composer Robert Lopez, Menzel's vocal range was able to clearly convey Elsa's [...] "low, vulnerable, fragile side" [...] as well as her power and self-realization. Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> me." [...] Buck and Lee were also surprised by how compatible Menzel and Kristen Bell's voices were. At one point during a table read, they sang a ballad (later revealed as [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings") back and forth to one another with so much sentiment that it reportedly left everyone who was present with tears in their eyes. Subsequently, Lee wanted Menzel and Bell {{to be in the same}} room when they were recording the important emotional scenes of the film.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Junos opening title sequence, {{depicting}} a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking {{a bottle of}} SunnyD orange drink, was put together over 7–8 months by a small design studio, Shadowplay Studio, based in Los Angeles. Reitman had met the studio's co-founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening. Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman's previous film, Thank You for Smoking, and he contacted them again {{when he found out}} he was going to direct Juno. With vintage 1970s punk-rock posters as inspiration, Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that [...] "had texture <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> edge, but also imparted the warmth and heart of the screenplay". In the last days of filming in Vancouver, Ellen Page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking SunnyD. 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand-drawn. The pictures were cut-out and scanned back onto the computer then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] by Barry Louis Polisar, the song Reitman had chosen. Shadowplay also designed the titlecards for each of the seasons for the film, hand-made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits, and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD.|$|E

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little bit of this, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> that, a little bit of black <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey."

Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones.
