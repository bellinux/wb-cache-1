Hence, study on the control of scouring at bridge piers plays an important role in bridge design. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a slotted <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shaped</b> pier in reducing local scour, as compared to a circular <b>shaped</b> and <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shaped</b> pier. The piers were tested under clear-water conditions for a uration of 3 hours and the resulting scour holes were scanned using a ScanStation 2. Further to this, velocity measurements were recorded at key points around the piers using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter.

This paper investigates the effect of shape parameterization on an automated <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> optimization problem. Four well known shape parameterization techniques were considered for study; Bezier curves, Class-Shape function Transformation, Hicks-Henne “Bump ” function and polynomial method. A boundary layer panel code was coupled with a surrogate-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and implemented within an automatic design loop. The optimization problem was formulated for NACA 0012 aerofoil at 5 degree angle of attack. The main criteria for comparison were {{based on the number of}} parameters required by each method for accurate representation of the aerofoil, the ability to find the aerofoil with the best performance within the constrained design space and also the computational cost. Preliminary results show that the optimization process was able to increase the lift-to-drag ratio of the aerofoil by 30 %.

50|$|The wing itself {{took the}} form of a flat ring or annulus, curved to form an <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> in section and with upward {{dihedral}} raising it progressively towards the tips.

40|$|An inverse {{design process}} {{is applied to}} {{determine}} blade shapes used in vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs).

The method was originally developed for wing design and applied for such <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shapes</b> as those of horizontal axis wind turbine blades. The procedure is employed here successfully to find a target shape that is used in a VAWT operating with blades of constant thickness rather than of <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape.</b> The method is presently applicable to determine blade shapes in a two dimensional section, and considers some performance criteria of VAWTs; thus, it contributes to finding blade shapes that most closely corresponds to the efficient operation of such turbines...|$|R
5000|$|One of the 701's {{visually}} {{distinctive features}} was the <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> {{given to the}} side-mounted external fuel tanks, positioned between the wheels. Before {{the start of the}} 1970 season Herd had reckoned on the car requiring a fuel capacity of [...] "well over" [...] 40 gallons for each race. Each of these side-mounted tanks contained six gallons of fuel that, combined with the main tank behind the driver's seat and two tanks {{on either side of the}} driver within the monocoque, gave the 701 a total fuel capacity of 60 gallons. The tanks' profile was created by Peter Wright, who at that time worked for March's bodywork contractor Specialised Mouldings. Although the <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> was claimed at the time to produce [...] "downthrust" [...] and aid stability, Herd has since stated that in the turbulent air between the wheels they would only have been marginally effective.|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The NACA 4 digit series <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shapes</b> are universally {{accepted}} standard designs generally used for wind turbine blades, helicopter rotor blades and car spoilers. The Design and Simulation of these complex shapes is a challenging {{task for the}} manufacturing engineers. These components {{need to be made}} of materials having high specific strength and better fatigue properties. The composites with sandwich construction fulfill the above requirements. The main aim of the present investigation is to select the best fiber orientation for the fabrication of automotive rear spoiler. The Design FOIL software provides different <b>shapes</b> of <b>aerofoil</b> from which NACA 2412 has been selected. The spoiler is modeled using CATIA software and is analyzed for the static deflection as well as harmonic analysis has been done by using ANSYS for various orientations of the fiber. The designed model has been compared with the values obtained from the simulation values. This confirms the design feasibility and software adoptability for the design of sandwich <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shapes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some recent designs use {{negative}} camber. One such {{design is}} called the supercritical aerofoil. It is used for near-supersonic flight, and produces a higher lift to drag ratio at near supersonic flight than traditional aerofoils. Supercritical aerofoils employ a flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shapes.</b> These changes delay the onset of wave drag.|$|R
50|$|Reaction Turbomachines operate by {{reacting}} to the flow of fluid through <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shaped</b> rotor and stator blades. The velocity of the fluid through the sets of blades increases slightly (as with a nozzle) as it passes from rotor to stator and vice versa. The velocity of the fluid then decreases again once it has passed between the gap. Pressure and enthalpy consistently decrease through the sets of blades.|$|R

Skinned with thin sheets of dural metal to give the <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> necessary for a wing, the girder section wing had fabric covered leading and trailing edges attached to it.

50|$|Two {{designs of}} a sail are predominant: camber induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1-5 camber {{inducers}} - plastic devices {{at the ends}} of battens which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> for faster speed and stability, but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of battens.|$|R
5000|$|Rotational sails have battens which {{protrude}} {{beyond the}} back {{aspect of the}} mast. They flip or [...] "rotate" [...] {{to the other side}} of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> on the leeward side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.|$|R

50|$|Foil kites {{consist of}} a number of cells with cloth ribs in each cell. It is the profile of these ribs that gives the kite its <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape</b> and enable it to {{generate}} lift. The most common type is the ram-air foil, where each cell has a gauze-covered opening at the front, meaning air is forced in during flight, giving the kite its stiffness and enabling it to hold its profile. Some ram-air foils are closed-cell, where a one-way valve locks the air inside the cells, giving some increased water relaunch capability.|$|R

When inflated, the wing's cross-section has the typical teardrop <b>aerofoil</b> <b>shape.</b> Modern paraglider wings are made of high-performance non-porous materials such as ripstop polyester or nylon fabric.|$|R
