5000|$|Between 1993 and 1995, the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) {{reached a}} series of pacts collectively known as the Oslo Accords. The accords were {{facilitated}} by the international community, led by the United States and the Russian Federation. Significantly, the pacts set a timeline for the final status negotiations of the occupied Palestinian territories (Gaza and the West Bank) and established an autonomous Palestinian National Authority (PNA) that could administrate the occupied territories during the ensuing interim period. Hence, a [...] "phased" [...] peace process was set in motion wherein the Palestinians would have an interim governmental body (the PNA) until such a time as [...] "final status" [...] negotiations would establish an official Palestinian state {{as part of a}} two state solution. The accords transferred jurisdiction over Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank from Israel to the PNA, whose charter calls {{for the creation of a}} democratically elected Legislative Council that could write laws pertaining to the economic, security, educational and health care needs of Gaza and West Bank Palestinians. Meanwhile, the Palestinian refugees residing in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria remained under the auspices of United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), pending a final agreement to determine their status. Historically, after their initial displacement, the United Nations (UN) created an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>agency</b> to service the needs of Palestinian refugees rather than placing them under the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Thus, the accords maintained the status quo for the refugees living in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria as they have been under UNRWA protection since 1949.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyse the regime in defence procurement together with the dynamics and the shape of coordination achieved among European states. Defence procurement regards the acquisition and management of military programmes by governments or <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>agencies.</b> Weapons procurement has historically been a domain of national states. Its apparent linkage with security affairs has hampered or rendered difficult cooperation among states. Nevertheless, pressured by internal and external factors, European countries are partly reconsidering their procurement policies. The last decade of the 20 th century has been characterized by significant turning points that have increased states’ willingness to coordinate their actions. In {{the first part of the}} research the nature of the regime is discussed: coordination in weapons procurement among European states reflects a security regime. Then, a depiction of the difficulties and challenges that a security regime presents is provided, deriving mainly from the available literature on this realm. Having defined the nature of the regime, the research highlights the basis for cooperation by considering the theoretical approaches that seem more likely to explain it: power based theories. In the second part of the research the findings emphasized in the theoretical part are employed to analyse the regime on defence procurement. Evidence of the features composing the regime and explanations of the difficulties of formalizing it and rendering it binding for all European states is made available. It is emphasized that while there exists a willingness to coordinate actions among states, tangible results have been achieved outside of the EU context and between the most powerful European states, mainly through OCCAR(Organization Conjointe de Cooperation en Matière d’Armement). OCCAR, an International Organization for the joint management of European military programmes does not constitute the regime itself, but contributes to its existence in a significant way. The degree and the shape of coordination reached within this organization amid ‘distributional’ issues provides informed insights for future cooperative efforts...|$|R

It considers {{the evolution of}} national transport policies and institutional frameworks in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia in the last 10 years, and analyses the influence that EU cooperation programmes (particularly those within the Euromed programme initiative) and international coordination activities have played in the evolution towards efficient, sustainable transport systems in those countries. Notwithstanding the significant socioeconomic, political and institutional differences among the three countries, three major traits are common to the transport policy framework in all cases: a focus on megaprojects; substitution of traditional ministerial services by <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> public <b>agencies</b> to develop those megaprojects, and progressive involvement of international private players for the operation (and eventually the design and construction) of new projects, focusing on know-how transfer rather than investment needs.

We define two <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network categories, namely mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks (MANETs) and smart sensor network, and discuss all further definitions and observations separately for both implementations. The main contribution of this report is the clear definition of properties, parameters, architectures, security requirements, and authentication models of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Furthermore, we derive design goals for all protocols to be implemented in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We also provide an extensive overview of present and future <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network applications, used standards, and proposed solutions. We believe that the authentication of network nodes {{and the establishment of}} secret keys among nodes are both target security objectives in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks.
