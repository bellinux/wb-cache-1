5000|$|The term “animal genetic resources” {{as used in}} the Global Plan of Action refers {{specifically}} to “animal genetic resources used in or potentially used for food and agriculture”. The Convention on Biological Diversity defines the term “genetic resources” as follows: “genetic material of actual or potential value”; “genetic material" [...] is taken to mean “ any material of plant, animal, microbial or other origin containing functional units of heredity.” In the Global Plan of Action, the term “livestock” is taken to refer to “all domesticated animals used for food and agriculture” and thus to include “both avian and mammalian species that contribute to food and agriculture”. Species from other taxonomic groups are not specifically excluded from {{the scope of the}} Global Plan of Action. However, the development of the Global Plan of Action was linked to the preparation of The State of the World’s <b>Animal</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resource</b> for Food and Agriculture, a report that focused on birds and mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} of issues regarding <b>animal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> {{on the global}} level is addressed by the Commission on <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA), which is a body of FAO. In May, 1997, The CGRFA established an Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on <b>Animal</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> for Food and Agriculture (ITWG-AnGR). The ITWG-AnGR's objectives are to review the situation and issues related to agrobiodiversity of <b>animal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resources</b> for food and agriculture and advise and make recommendations to the Commission on these matters, and consider progress resulting from proposed interventions. This group worked with many partners and countries to produce the First Report on the State of <b>Animal</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources,</b> which served {{as the basis for}} creating the Global Plan of Action for <b>Animal</b> <b>Genetic</b> <b>Resources</b> (GPA). In 2007, the GPA was adopted by 109 countries as the first agreed international framework for the {{management of}} livestock biodiversity.

Empirical SMS cost estimates are obtained using data from three AnGR economics case studies in Mexico and Italy. The findings support our hypothesis that the costs of implementing an SMS are low, both when compared with the size of subsidies currently being provided to the livestock sector (2. 9). Nevertheless, despite providing a potentially useful AnGR conservation decision support tool, a critical assessment of the application reveals that a much more extensive quantification of the components required to determine SMS costs needs to be undertaken before this tool can be applied in practice...|$|E

As full attention cannot be given to all populations at risk, an important role of research on FAnGR is economic analysis to inform priority setting: ensuring an appropriate focus of conservation efforts - breeds/populations, traits, approaches to be applied. Such analysis can also inform policy-making, to ensure that interventions are taken to apply agricultural development processes which are compatible with conservation and sustainable objectives.

As a consequence the method is deemed to be appropriate for the valuation of non-market functions in production.

40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{demands of}} a growing human population and the pressures of economic development are affecting the security and survival of many indigenous African breeds. Until now, these breeds have been a stable part of their particular ecosystems for hundreds of years. There is an increasing tendency to introduce exotic germplasm and/or to concentrate on a narrow range of supposedly more profitable breeds. As a result, indigenous breeds are threatened, {{even though they have}} been naturally selected for the local environments and are therefore best adapted. This paper describes the production systems in Africa and highlights the contribution of sheep and goats to subsistence farming systems and the general welfare of society. Problems preventing extensive utilisation and improvement of African animal genetic resources need to be identified. Genetic improvement programmes need to be developed. Breeds already endangered need to be conserved as a matter of urgency even if their economic value is not presently apparent. Concurrently, information should be compiled on biological performance and adaptive characteristics of these AGR (<b>animal</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource)</b> populations to aid the development of rational utilisation and conservation programmes...|$|E
