5|$|Aarhus {{has a large}} {{variety of}} {{restaurants}} and eateries offering food from cultures all over the world, especially Mediterranean and Asian, but also international gourmet cuisine, traditional Danish food and New Nordic Cuisine. Among the oldest restaurants are Rådhuscafeen (lit. The City Hall Café), opened in 1924, serving <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> traditional Danish meals, and Peter Gift from 1906, a tavern with a broad beer selection and <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> smørrebrød and other Danish dishes. In Aarhus, New Nordic can be experienced at Kähler Villa Dining, Hærværk and Domestic, but local produce can be had at many places, especially at the twice-weekly food markets in Frederiksbjerg. Arhus and the Central Denmark Region was selected as European Region of Gastronomy in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> dishes through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E

25|$|When mice {{have more}} than one button, the {{software}} may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will bring up <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will bring up a contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.|$|E
25|$|Macroeconomic {{policy-making}} is {{a context}} requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically {{a central bank}} must choose a stance for monetary policy that balances competing objectives — low inflation, low unemployment, low balance of trade deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses {{a model of the}} economy that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it simulates the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> possible predicted outcomes for the various variables of interest. Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.|$|E
25|$|Players {{typically}} {{navigate the}} game world from a first or third-person perspective in 3D RPGs. However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective {{is common in}} party-based RPGs, {{in order to give}} the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings. Role-playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information, and frequently make use of a windowed interface. For example, spell-casting characters will often have <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> spells they can use. On the PC, players typically use the mouse to click on icons and menu options, while console games have the player navigate through menus using a game controller. Older games often revealed calculations of the game as seen in Dungeons & Dragons games, although more recent games have removed this information to improve immersion.|$|E

500|$|In {{a combat}} phase, the game shifts to an [...] "arcade {{sequence}}", {{which allows the}} player to control a tank in the Sahara Desert. The arcade sequence presents <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> tank functions; a gun turret, shell loading, firing and navigational buttons. Only one function can be used at a time; in order to drive the tank, the player has to use the navigational buttons to manoeuvre. If the tank becomes under attack, the gun turret or shell-firing mode must be activated for self-defence. Both the arcade sequence and tank controlling is optional, however, and {{is not required to}} finish the game.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} {{nature and}} [...] "free-form" [...] gameplay encourage creating personal networks, and cooperating and fighting with other players. Players interact with Anarchy Onlines interface via a keyboard and mouse. The game's heads-up display {{consists of a}} series of windows, menus and buttons located {{on the periphery of the}} screen. Players communicate with each other by typing text in chat windows, and occasionally through emotive character animations. Communication with computer-controlled characters is executed via text windows, in which players chose from <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> possible responses to the conversation being shown. Like most role playing games, Anarchy Online provides structure for role-playing events. Most major cities include night clubs and other venues specifically for this. Events are organized either by players, or officially by Funcom staff.|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was also}} noted for his Lucullus Circle dinners and women-only luncheons, which were both very popular.

[...] The view also features a close-up of the Wrigley Building's clock tower. [...] Although it offers <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> appetizers and entrees, it is said to focus on serving drinks, and Time Out Chicago describes it as a posh playground for consuming cocktails. The Chicago Sun-Times praises its views and ranks it as the number one al fresco dining venue in Chicago. It is open daily afternoons and evenings, weather permitting.|$|E
500|$|Grainger was {{a musical}} democrat; he {{believed}} that in a performance each player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were employed in Love Verses from [...] "The Song of Solomon" [...] (1899), and Train Music (1901), long before [...] Stravinsky adopted this practice. In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, harmoniums, banjos, and ukuleles. [...] In one early [...] concert of [...] folk music, Quilter and [...] Scott were conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts. [...] In [...] "Random Round" [...] (1912–14), inspired by the communal music-making [...] he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; [...] individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from <b>a</b> <b>menu</b> <b>of</b> variations. [...] This experiment in [...] "aleatory" [...] composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.|$|E
