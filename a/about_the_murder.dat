The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave.

5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them to talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of}} the murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough.
