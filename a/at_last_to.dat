5|$|In Marion, {{the body}} of Warren Harding was placed on a horse-drawn hearse, which was {{followed}} by President Coolidge and Chief Justice Taft, then by Harding's wife and father. They followed it through the city, past the Star building where the presses stood silent, and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> the Marion Cemetery, where the casket {{was placed in the}} cemetery's receiving vault. Harding's body, along with that of his wife who died in 1924, rests today in the Harding Tomb, which was dedicated in 1931 by President Hoover.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed from photographs on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> be happening.|$|E

25|$|As the {{designers}} and builders pushed north into Columbia County, connecting Lake Taghkanic State Park <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> the parkway, they {{took advantage of}} the more open and rolling terrain to improve the road's scenic possibilities. Medians averaged 100 feet (31 m) in width, and it was easier to include views of the distant Catskills. Curves were generally wider than they had been in Dutchess County. A service station was built in the median at the park, and a scenic overlook at CR8.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Bunin's {{second wife}} was Vera Muromtseva (1881–1961), niece of the {{high-ranking}} politician Sergey Muromtsev. The two had initially {{been introduced to}} each other by writer Yekaterina Lopatina some years earlier, but it was their encounter {{at the house of}} the writer Boris Zaitsev in November 1906 which led to an intense relationship which resulted in the couple becoming inseparable until Bunin's dying day. Bunin and Muromtseva married officially only in 1922, after he managed <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> divorce Tsakni legally. Decades later Vera Muromtseva-Bunina became famous in her own right with her book Life of Bunin.|$|E
25|$|Cercle {{remained}} in this third tier until 1956, when they won their league. They {{spent the next}} season once again battling relegation, this time with more success, though their second season {{back in the second}} tier went less well. The club secured only nine points in the season's first half, avoiding relegation only with a win under coach Louis Versyp in the season's last match. A few weeks later Versyp was replaced by the Frenchman Edmond Delfour. This replacement inaugurated a more successful new era at Cercle who, under Delfour's command, missed promotion only barely in 1960 and returend <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> the top flight in 1961.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Abel Pargiter visits his {{mistress}} Mira in a dingy suburb, then returns {{home to his}} children and his invalid wife Rose. His eldest daughter Eleanor is a do-gooder in her early twenties, and Milly and Delia are in their teens. Morris, the eldest brother, is already a practising barrister. Delia feels trapped by her mother's illness and looks forward to her death. Ten-year-old Rose quarrels with twelve-year-old Martin and sneaks off by herself to a nearby toyshop. On the way back she is frightened by a man exposing himself. As the family prepares for bed, Mrs Pargiter seems <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> have died, but she recovers.|$|E
25|$|These events {{allowed the}} Chaldeans to once more attempt to assert themselves. While the Assyrian king was {{otherwise}} occupied defending his Iranian colonies from the Scythians and Cimmerians and driving the Egyptians from Canaan, Marduk-apla-iddina II (the Biblical Merodach-Baladan) of Bit-Yâkin, allied {{himself with the}} powerful Elamite kingdom and the native Babylonians, briefly seizing control of Babylon between 721 and 710 BC. With the Scythians and Cimmerians vanquished, the Medes and Persians pledging loyalty, and the Egyptians defeated and ejected from southern Canaan, Sargon II was free <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> deal with the Chaldeans, Babylonians and Elamites. He attacked and deposed Marduk-apla-iddina II in 710 BC, also defeating his Elamite allies in the process. After defeat by the Assyrians, Merodach-Baladan fled to his protectors in Elam.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} year, 9,000 men led by Charles routed 12,000 Danes at the Battle of Landskrona. This {{proved to be}} the last pitched battle of the war since, in September 1678, Christian V evacuated his army back to Zealand. In 1679, Louis XIV of France dictated the terms of a general pacification, and Charles XI, who is said to have bitterly resented [...] "the insufferable tutelage" [...] of the French king, was forced <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> acquiesce to a peace that managed to leave his empire practically intact. Peace was made with Denmark in the treaties of Fontainebleau (1679) and Lund, and with Brandenburg in the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679).|$|E
500|$|Regarding Shakespeare's weaving {{together}} of the story's threads, Hazlitt marvels at the [...] "ease and conscious unconcern" [...] with which [...] "he most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived [...] {{in such a}} manner as to lead <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> the most complete developement of the catastrophe." [...] Again, he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of Dr. Johnson [...] "that Shakespear was generally inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is true; and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present play, but the conclusion of Lear, of Romeo and Juliet, of Macbeth, of Othello, even of Hamlet, and of other plays of less moment, in which the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural means." ...|$|E
500|$|Social issues {{provoked}} greater disagreement. Kearney's Western faction {{gained a}} victory when the platform {{was made to}} include a call {{for an end to}} Chinese immigration. They also turned, <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> <b>to</b> the issue of suffrage. They eventually agreed on a vague statement in the platform, that the party would [...] "denounce as dangerous, the efforts everywhere manifest to restrict the right of suffrage". Many of the delegates found this unsatisfying, and called for a separate resolution on the subject. After more debate, a resolution calling for the enfranchisement of [...] "every citizen" [...] passed by a vote of 528 to 124. The Socialist Labor faction proposed another resolution declaring [...] "that land, air, and water are the grand gifts of nature to all mankind", and that no person had a right to monopolize them; the convention applauded, but the proposal was shunted off to a committee.|$|E

500|$|I ... {{appeal to}} the House to {{consider}} well our interests in the Western Ocean, on our western coast, and the trade to China and India; and {{the ease with which}} it can be brought down the Missouri. What is this commerce? Thousands of years have passed by, and, year after year, all the nations of the earth have, each year, sought the rich commerce of that country; all have enjoyed the riches of the East. That trade was sought by King Solomon, by Tyre, Sidon; this wealth found its way to Egypt, and <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> Rome, to France, Portugal, Spain, Holland, England, and finally to this Republic. How vast and incomparably rich must be that country and commerce, which has never ceased, one day, from the highest point of Jewish splendor to the instant that I am speaking, to supply the whole globe with all the busy imagination of man can desire for his ease, comfort, and enjoyment! Whilst we Rave so fair an opportunity offered to participate so largely in all this wealth and enjoyment, if not to govern and direct the whole, can it be possible that doubt, or mere points of speculation, will weigh with the House and cause us to lose forever the brightest prospect ever presented to the eyes of a nation?" ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1982 Horne {{sang the}} part {{alongside}} John Alexander's Goffredo and Samuel Ramey's Argante, in a National Arts Centre (NAC) production in Ottawa directed by Frank Corsaro. The performance, with Mario Bernardi conducting the NAC Orchestra, was applauded by Montreal Gazette critic Eric McLean for its fine music making and its displays of [...] "architectural and sartorial splendour". Eighteen months later, on 19 January 1984 Bernardi and Corsaro, with Horne, Ramey and Benita Valente from the Ottawa cast, brought the production to New York for the work's debut at the Metropolitan Opera. The production was loaned to the Met for its centennial season by the National Arts Centre of Canada [...] "in deep {{appreciation of the}} many years during which Canadians have enjoyed opera from the Met – on tour, on radio and in New York". Donal Henahan in The New York Times praised all the singers in turn, with a special mention for Valente's [...] "plaintive and affecting" [...] rendering of the popular aria [...] "Lascia ch'io pianga". But, says Henahan, [...] "the loudest cheers of the night went <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> the choreographer, Eugene Collins, and an incredibly nimble corps of tumbling warriors". After ten performances at the Metropolitan Opera House the production was taken in May to Washington, D.C., and toured in the US before returning to New York in June for several outdoors performances.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Naples, the Shelleys {{settled in}} Rome, {{the city where}} her husband wrote where [...] "the meanest streets were strewed with {{truncated}} columns, broken capitals...and sparkling fragments of granite or porphyry...The voice of dead time, in still vibrations, is breathed from these dumb things, animated and glorified [...] as they were by man". Rome inspired her to begin writing the unfinished novel Valerius, the Reanimated Roman, where the eponymous hero resists the decay of Rome and the machinations of [...] "superstitious" [...] Catholicism. The writing of her novel was broken off when her son William died of malaria. Shelley bitterly commented that she come to Italy to improve her husband's health, and instead the Italian climate had just killed her two children, leading her to write: [...] "May you my dear Marianne never {{know what it is}} to lose two only and lovely children in one year-to watch their dying moments-and then <b>at</b> <b>last</b> <b>to</b> be left childless and forever miserable". To deal with her grief, Shelley wrote the novella The Fields of Fancy, which became Matilda dealing with a young woman whose beauty inspired incestuous love in her father, who ultimately commits suicide to stop himself from acting on his passion for his daughter, while she spends the rest of her life full of despair about [...] "the unnatural love I had inspired". The novella offered a feminist critique of a patriarchal society as Matilda is punished in the afterlife though she did nothing to encourage her father's feelings.|$|E
