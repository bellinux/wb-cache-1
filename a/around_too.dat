5|$|In Kansas City, Kansas, two {{religious}} missionaries visit {{two women}} at two different {{homes in the}} same neighborhood who look exactly alike. The second woman yells at them to go away and the two men, inexplicably, get into a fight in the second woman's front yard. Later, two FBI agents who look and sound remarkably similar to Mulder and Scully visit the first woman, Betty Templeton (Kathy Griffin). Betty claims to have never seen the other woman before. The other woman then passes her by in a car and the two agents begin fighting each other, much like the missionaries. They are severely injured after the gruesome mauling. Both agents, who had worked together for seven years, said that they were possessed. Meanwhile, the other woman, Lulu Pfeiffer (also Kathy Griffin), applies for a job at Koko's Copies, but does not get it because she has had 17 jobs in 17 states {{in the past three years}} and moves <b>around</b> <b>too</b> much. She becomes aggravated and suddenly, all the copies become black. The other woman, Betty, goes to another job with the same name and same resume.|$|E

25|$|The Italians {{were aware}} of sorties from Alexandria and Gibraltar by 7 November, and sent nine {{submarines}} to attack a Malta convoy (MW 3) detected on 8 November. Bombers (unsurprisingly) failed even to pinpoint the Judgement force, and when Force H was detected headed back toward Gibraltar on 9 November, the Italians presumed MW 3 had turned <b>around,</b> <b>too.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tony's storylines mainly {{centred on}} his {{developing}} {{relationship with his}} son, and marital issues with his wife. Before the series began {{it was decided that}} Hannah (Tony's wife) plus their other child, would come back into Tony's life {{for the sake of the}} family - but not stay <b>around</b> <b>too</b> long because the neighbourhood would appal her. This was eventually recreated on-screen.|$|E
500|$|Smith sees Ling's attacks {{as pointed}} and {{consciously}} vicious. [...] She attacks because her words have consequences, clearing {{a path for}} her own selfish interests. [...] Nelle Porter says, [...] "I admire the way you don't let yourself be pushed <b>around.</b> <b>Too</b> many people when they think they've been wronged just walk away." [...] Jeff Yang, founding publisher of A Magazine, a New York-based publication on Asian American culture, sees Ling as [...] "a strong Asian woman who's clearly potent, clearly has control. She's not a victim, not somebody who lets anyone come even close to victimizing her." ...|$|E

50|$|In Louisiana, John McKeithen {{had been}} allowed a second term due to a new rule enacted that allowed {{governors}} two consecutive terms, and thus, wasallowed to run {{for a second term}} (see Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1967).

500|$|Internationalist was {{recorded}} at Melbourne's Sing Sing Studios, with Powderfinger accompanied by American producer Nick DiDia {{for the first}} time. As the band had already prepared [...] "about 30 or 40" [...] songs when they entered the studio, DiDia's task was relatively minor. Bassist John Collins said of DiDia; [...] "Nick was really good. The way Nick based the record was {{that he wanted to}} record the band how we were at that particular moment, he didn't want to play <b>around</b> <b>too</b> much." [...] As a result of this attitude, the band only spent one month in the studio, and the album was mixed by DiDia soon after. [...] Powderfinger used the extra time to play table tennis, which was the band's recreation of choice during the Internationalist and Odyssey Number Five recording sessions.|$|E
500|$|Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment {{gave the}} film 3.5 out of 5 stars {{and called it}} a [...] "good {{suspense}} thriller which will be a treat for family audience", and stated [...] "the {{second half of the}} film is simply superb and the suspense element makes you {{sit on the edge of}} the seat and watch the movie biting your nails. The climax is also good and it makes the viewers to walk out of the cinema hall with a contented heart". IndiaGlitz gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "The biggest strength of Drushyam is not its genre, but the fact that an excellent screenplay has been written <b>around</b> <b>too</b> less characters for a movie of this genre and without sub plots and the like", and added that [...] "Drushyam is edge-of-the-seat, but it doesn't demand the audience to connect the threads. An unconventional film, this film is refreshing as it is not formulaic".|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby <b>around</b> <b>too</b> much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

Late in the series, she starts dating JoJo.|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the next}} 10 minutes, Harambe became {{increasingly}} [...] "agitated and disoriented" [...] by {{the screams of}} onlookers. He dragged the child through the water, occasionally propping him up when he sat, or pushing him down when he stood. Harambe exhibited [...] "strutting" [...] behavior—walking around with legs and arms stiffly extended to appear bigger—a bluffing move, though one with inherent danger should he throw or drag the boy <b>around</b> <b>too</b> roughly. Harambe then carried the boy up a ladder out of the moat onto dry land. Afraid for the boy's life, zoo officials {{made the decision to}} kill the gorilla, doing so with a single rifle shot. Cincinnati firefighters said the boy was between Harambe's legs when the shot was fired. Harambe was killed one day after his 17th birthday.|$|E
2500|$|Liddell was {{defeated}} by Rua due to punches {{late in the first}} round resulting in a technical knockout. After the fight, White declared that Liddell would retire from fighting. White stated, [...] "I care about him. I care about his health, and it's over, man. It's over." [...] White went further, saying, [...] "At the end of the day, I care about these guys. I don't want to see anybody stick <b>around</b> <b>too</b> long. You're never going to see Chuck Liddell on the canvas again." [...] In May however, Liddell's trainer, John Hackleman, claimed 'with confidence' that Liddell isn't done yet and that he's [...] "definitely on top of the food chain." [...] Liddell has [...] "more than one fight left in him." [...] In an interview afterward, White went on to rhetorically ask [...] "can I tell him not to fight? Absolutely not. If he still wants to fight, he can fight. I'm not saying, 'It will never happen. It will never happen.' But he made a deal with me [...]" ...|$|E
