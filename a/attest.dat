5|$|A gold {{cylinder}} seal bearing Menkauhor's cartouche {{as part of}} the name of his pyramid together with the serekh of Djedkare Isesi is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, purportedly discovered near the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could <b>attest</b> to wide ranging trade-contacts during the Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake's history {{dates back}} to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The {{inscriptions}} found at Sanchi <b>attest</b> to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not lie on the trade route.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{documents}} <b>attest</b> {{that around}} 1437 {{a representative of}} the Raczków family, Jakub Tabutowicz of the coat of arms Łabędź, received from Michael Žygimantaitis son of Sigismund Kęstutaitis, Duke of Lithuania, a wilderness area along the river Biała that marked the beginning of Białystok as a settlement.|$|E

50|$|There {{were also}} several other late Uruk {{enclaves}} and outposts in this general area. They include Arslantepe (<b>attested</b> at level VIA), Hassek Höyük (<b>attested</b> at level 5), Jebel/Djebel Aruda (near Tell es-Sweyhat), and Tepecik (Elazığ Province, <b>attested</b> at level 3). Godin Tepe {{is a similar}} site in Iran.|$|R
5|$|The Harivamsa, an {{appendix}} to {{the epic}} Mahabharata, mentions that Kama and Rati have two children, Harsha ("Joy") and Yashas ("Grace"). However, the Vishnu Purana mentions that Rati, as Nandi, only has one son – Harsha. The epics Mahabharata {{as well as}} the Ramayana, also <b>attest</b> to Rati being the consort of Kama.|$|E
5|$|The {{downward}} spiral {{of the economy}} has been attributed mainly to mismanagement and corruption by the government and the eviction of more than 4,000 white farmers in the controversial land confiscations of 2000. The Zimbabwean government and its supporters <b>attest</b> that it was Western policies to avenge the expulsion of their kin that sabotaged the economy.|$|E
5|$|The oldest Indian {{manuscript}} {{to mention}} Trijata's presence in Ayodhya is the Paumacriu. Many suggest that, after Sita's exile {{and the subsequent}} battle between Rama and his sons, Sita be reaccepted by Rama. Trijata and Lankasundari are called from Lanka to <b>attest</b> to Sita's chastity {{and both of them}} suggest an ordeal to convince the world of her purity.|$|E

50|$|The place-name 'Braxted' {{is first}} <b>attested</b> in the Domesday Book of 1086, where {{it appears as}} Brachesteda. The name comes from the Old English 'braec', meaning 'newly {{cultivated}} land'. Great Braxted is first <b>attested</b> (in Latin) as Magna Bracsted in 1206, whilst Little Braxted is first <b>attested</b> as Parva Bracstede in 1254.|$|R
50|$|The {{names of}} 4 tribuni (regimental commanders) are <b>attested.</b> One {{dedicated}} a stone at Aime in Alpine Gaul and so probably originated there (c. 200). 3 centuriones (infantry officers) and 1 decurio (cavalry officer) are <b>attested,</b> of {{which one was}} buried in Salona and was therefore probably Illyrian. 1 caligatus (ranker) is <b>attested.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{records of}} the Australian Board of Control <b>attest</b> to board member Clem Jones's protestations against Meckiff's {{inclusion}} when the selectors' proposed team list was submitted for approval. Jones cited the bowler's questionable action but the Chairman Ewart Macmillan rejected his objection as unconstitutional. Two other board members attempted to overrule the chairman, but their motion was defeated.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{facilities}} were {{destroyed in the}} aftermath of a massive earthquake that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to Sidon but did not survive the Arab conquest of 635. Ancient texts <b>attest</b> that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Beirut's historic center.|$|E
5|$|The subfamilies {{are shown}} below; a few genera, mostly fossil, are of {{uncertain}} or basal position. The fossil record of antlions {{is very small}} by neuropteran standards. However, some Mesozoic fossils <b>attest</b> to the antlions' origin more than 150 million years ago. These were at one time separated as the Palaeoleontidae, but are now usually recognized as early antlions.|$|E
50|$|The {{names of}} 2 praefecti (regimental commanders) are <b>attested.</b> One, Iulius Maximus is <b>attested</b> {{as from the}} city of Rome (135). The other, Marcus Caecilius Donatianus, is <b>attested</b> in the votive altar at Carvoran (3rd century) to a virgo caelestis ("celestial virgin"), {{probably}} Tanit, the guardian-goddess of Carthage, implying that Donatianus was perhaps from Africa proconsularis. Also <b>attested</b> is an imaginifer (bearer of the imperial image) (3rd century) and a pedes (common foot soldier) of the Treveri Gallic tribe (135).|$|R

5|$|Although immobilizing {{a victim}} {{in front of}} a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the victim was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that <b>attest</b> that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{never married}} {{and he kept}} no account of any romantic relationships, {{although}} his family held that {{he had once been}} in love with Teresa de Leyba, sister of Don Fernando de Leyba, the lieutenant governor of Spanish Louisiana. Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts in the archives of the Wisconsin Historical Society <b>attest</b> to their belief in Clark's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance.|$|E
5|$|Egypt entertained {{continuing}} {{trade relations}} with the Levant during Djedkare's reign, possibly {{as far north as}} Anatolia. A gold cylinder seal bearing the serekh of Djedkare Isesi together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The seal, whose gold may originate from the Pactolus river valley in western Anatolia, could <b>attest</b> to wide-ranging trade-contacts during the later Fifth Dynasty, but its provenance remains unverifiable.|$|E
5000|$|In the West, {{the most}} famous katepanate, that of {{southern}} Italy, is <b>attested</b> in the Escorial Taktikon, a list of offices compiled circa 971-975, and after the successful conclusion of the Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars, a katepanō of Bulgaria is also <b>attested.</b> A Serbian catepanate is also <b>attested,</b> which {{was known as the}} [...] "katepano of Ras".|$|R

5|$|For {{exceptionally}} meritorious service {{during a}} period in 1967. USS Triton conducted important and arduous independent submarine operations of great importance to the national defense of the United States. The outstanding results achieved during the highly successful operations <b>attest</b> to the exceptional professional skill, resourcefulness and ingenuity of Tritons officers and men. Their inspiring performance of duty throughout was {{in keeping with the}} highest traditions of the naval service.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} of Nero, {{senators}} were still primarily from Rome {{and other parts of}} Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the most eastern province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By {{the time of}} the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions <b>attest</b> to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (patria).|$|E
5|$|Most sources agree Overton {{had five}} victories. However, {{there is a}} dispute as to whether this number is higher, thanks to the disputed account of one mission. A few sources claim Overton flew one final mission on 25 January 1953 and shot down two more MiG-15s which he never {{received}} credit for. Other sources <b>attest</b> that this mission— the same in which Edwin Heller was shot down— took place 23 January and Overton shot down only one aircraft during the flight.|$|E

5|$|Other fossils <b>attest</b> to {{the even}} earlier {{presence}} of H. erectus in Java. Sangiran 2 (named after its discovery site) {{may be as}} old as 1.66 Ma (million years). The controversial Mojokerto child, which Carl C. Swisher and Garniss Curtis once dated to 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 ± 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with {{a margin of error}} of plus or minus 130,000 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{hundreds}} of villae found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, <b>attest</b> {{to the existence}} of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners. Many villae belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest. Of the lower classes, much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting {{to the existence of}} guilds (collegia) of boat skippers, doctors, teachers and traders, {{as well as to the}} existence of a trade in slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{mineral springs}} of the Borjomi valley were {{discovered}} over one thousand years ago. Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists {{dating back to}} the beginning of the 7th century <b>attest</b> to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes. The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century. By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated and covered with impassable forests.|$|E
