5|$|In 1905, {{members of}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation {{organized}} the failed Yıldız Attempt, an assassination plot on Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{in the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul); the explosion missed its target by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> Dashnaksutiun founder Kristapor Mikaelian was lost by an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had lasted only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit {{for a full}} day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E

5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting {{one or two days}} but in some species only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>the</b> subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> (<b>the</b> time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>the</b> submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was {{believed to have been}} sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>the</b> request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> male calls {{to a female}} and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
25|$|In {{small bowel}} obstruction, the pain {{tends to be}} colicky (cramping and intermittent) in nature, with spasms lasting <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> pain tends to be central and mid-abdominal. Vomiting may occur before constipation.|$|E

25|$|At midnight, with {{ammunition}} running low, Captain Hector Waller {{ordered his}} ship {{to try to}} force a way through. Just as Perth settled on a new heading, four Japanese torpedoes hit the cruiser {{in the space of}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> first hit on the starboard side and damaged the forward engine room, the second caused a hull breach near the bridge, the third impacted in the starboard aft area, and the fourth struck on the port side.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in the TeV range {{emanating from}} the Crab Nebula was first detected in 1989 by the Whipple Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, in Arizona in the USA. Modern Cherenkov telescope experiments like H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, and CANGAROO III can detect the Crab Nebula in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> most energetic photons (up to 16 TeV) observed from an extragalactic object originate from the blazar, Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). These measurements were done by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) air Cherenkov telescopes.|$|E

25|$|The pyramid {{method of}} {{harvesting}} worm compost {{is commonly used}} in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which {{the rest of the}} process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow {{to the bottom of the}} pile. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>the</b> top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.|$|E
25|$|O. ficus-indica is {{sensitive}} to lack of oxygen in the root zone, requiring well-drained soils. Opuntia ficus-indica is similar to CAM species which are not salt-tolerant in their root zone where growth may cease under high salt concentration. O. ficus-indica grows usually in regions where relative humidity is above 60% and saturation deficit occurs. O. ficus-indica is absent in regions where there is less than 40% humidity {{for more than a}} month. Mean daily temperature required to develop is at least 1.5-2°C. At -10 to -12°C, prickly pear growth is inhibited even if it is exposed to these temperatures only for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> maximum temperature limit of prickly pear is above 50°C.|$|E
25|$|Next, Owen Hart and Yokozuna, {{accompanied}} by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against the Allied Powers (Lex Luger and The British Bulldog). The challengers got the advantage early on, with Luger wearing down Yokozuna by smashing Yokozuna's {{head into the}} top turnbuckle. Yokozuna accidentally fell onto Hart's foot, sparking a confrontation between the tag team partners. After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>the</b> two settled their differences, the challengers retained the advantage {{for much of the}} match. The finish came after the Allied Powers double-teamed on Yokozuna. Following a back suplex, the referee ordered Bulldog, who wasn't the legal man, out of the ring. Hart hit the distracted Luger with a double axe handle from the top rope, allowing Yokozuna to pin Luger with a leg drop.|$|E
