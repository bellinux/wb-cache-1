5|$|On April 25, 2007, the AIM {{satellite}} (<b>Aeronomy</b> of Ice in the Mesosphere) was launched. It is {{the first}} satellite dedicated to studying noctilucent clouds, and made its first observations on May 25, 2007. Images taken by the satellite show shapes in the clouds {{that are similar to}} shapes in tropospheric clouds, hinting at similarities in their dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} <b>Aeronomy</b> of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|The International Association of Geomagnetism and <b>Aeronomy</b> {{maintains}} a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. It is updated every 5 years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed {{using data from}} satellites (Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories. The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).|$|E
25|$|The <b>aeronomy</b> {{department}} and partially the terrestrial and planetary study center merged on 1 January 2009 into the laboratoire atmosphères, milieux et observations spatiales (LATMOS, atmospheres, environments and space observations laboratory), {{placed under the}} supervision of UVSQ.|$|E
25|$|Terrestrial <b>aeronomy</b> {{experiments}} at Arecibo {{have included}} the Coqui 2 experiment, supported by NASA. The telescope also has military intelligence uses, some of which include locating Soviet radar installations by detecting their signals bouncing off the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace (Pierre-Simon Laplace Institut), a {{research}} institute in global environmental sciences, located at Guyancourt, composed of six laboratories which only three are under partial guardianship of UVSQ : terrestrial and planetary study center, <b>aeronomy</b> department, laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (Climate science and environment laboratory).|$|E
25|$|In addition, International Journal of Geomagnetism and <b>Aeronomy</b> is {{no longer}} {{published}} and AGU distributes Chinese Journal of Geophysics and Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. Many of the journals have high impact factors, with Paleoceanography having the highest within paleontology and Reviews of Geophysics the second highest within geochemistry and geophysics as of 2010. AGU has also been publishing books for more than 85 years.|$|E
25|$|An {{earthquake}} precursor is an anomalous {{phenomenon that}} might give effective warning of an impending earthquake. Reports of these – though generally recognized as such only after the event – number in the thousands, some dating back to antiquity. There have been around 400 reports of possible precursors in scientific literature, of roughly twenty different types, running the gamut from <b>aeronomy</b> to zoology. None {{have been found to}} be reliable for the purposes of earthquake prediction.|$|E
25|$|Academics and {{researchers}} responded by organizing {{to protect and}} advocate for the observatory. They established the Arecibo Science Advocacy Partnership (ASAP), to advance the scientific excellence of Arecibo Observatory research and to publicize its accomplishments in astronomy, <b>aeronomy</b> and planetary radar. ASAP's goals included mobilizing the existing broad base of support for Arecibo science within the fields it serves directly, the broad scientific community; provide a forum for the Arecibo research community and enhance communication within it; promote the potential of Arecibo for groundbreaking science; suggest paths that will maximize it into the foreseeable future, and showcase the broad impact and far-reaching implications of the science currently carried out with this unique instrument.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{predicted}} that the initial radioactivity plume from the stricken Japanese reactors would reach the United States by 18 March. Health and nuclear experts emphasized that radioactivity in the plume would be diluted as it traveled and, at worst, would have extremely minor health consequences in the United States. A simulation by the Belgian Institute for Space <b>Aeronomy</b> indicated that trace amounts of radioactivity would reach California and Mexico around 19 March. These predictions were tested by a worldwide network of highly sensitive radiative isotope measuring equipment, with the resulting data used to assess any potential impact to human health {{as well as the}} status of the reactors in Japan. Consequently, by 18 March radioactive fallout including isotopes of iodine-131, iodine-132, tellurium-132, iodine-133, caesium-134 and caesium-137 was detected in air filters at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA.|$|E

2500|$|Measurements of Martian {{temperature}} predate the Space Age. However, early instrumentation {{and techniques}} of radio astronomy produced crude, differing results. Early flyby probes (Mariner 4) and later orbiters used radio occultation to perform <b>aeronomy.</b> [...] With chemical composition already deduced from spectroscopy, temperature and pressure {{could then be}} derived. [...] Nevertheless, flyby occultations can only measure properties along two transects, at their trajectories' entries and exits from Mars' disk as seen from Earth. [...] This results in weather [...] "snapshots" [...] at a particular area, at a particular time. [...] Orbiters then {{increase the number of}} radio transects. Later missions, starting with the dual Mariner 6 and 7 flybys, plus the Soviet Mars 2 and 3, carried infrared detectors to measure radiant energy. [...] Mariner 9 was the first to place an infrared radiometer and spectrometer in Mars orbit in 1971, along with its other instruments and radio transmitter. [...] Viking 1 and 2 followed, with not merely Infrared Thermal Mappers (IRTM). [...] The missions could also corroborate these remote sensing datasets with not only their in situ lander metrology booms, but with higher-altitude temperature and pressure sensors for their descent.|$|E
