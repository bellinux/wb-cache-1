5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part. Indeed, Tacitus calls it Tiberius' intima causa, his innermost reason for departing for Rhodes, and seems to ascribe the entire move to a hatred of Julia and <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> Vipsania. Tiberius had found himself married to a woman he loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the woman he had loved.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> a pre-Christian Northern past; {{the mass media}} typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) AH 561- AH 638 (July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (tariqa). His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of tawhid (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of wahdat al-wujud (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (ʿubudiyya), and that there may never be in your soul <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> any existing thing'.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{rigorous}} debate in Indian literature on relative merits of these theoretical spiritual practices. For example, Chandogyopanishad suggests {{that those who}} engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice, while those who engage in tapas will succeed; Svetasvataropanishad suggests that a successful spiritual practice requires <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> truth, but warns of becoming 'false ascetic' who go through the mechanics of spiritual practice without meditating {{on the nature of}} Self and universal Truths. In the practice of Hinduism, suggest modern era scholars such as Vivekananda, the choice between the paths is up to the individual and a person's proclivities. Other scholars suggest that these Hindu spiritual practices are not mutually exclusive, but overlapping. These four paths of spirituality are also known in Hinduism outside India, such as in Balinese Hinduism, where it is called Catur Marga (literally: four paths).|$|E

500|$|Apart {{from a few}} early attempts, Hebel's {{began his}} {{literary}} work {{near the end of}} the 18th century. After returning to Karlsruhe from a trip to Wiesental in 1799, he began to write Allemannische Gedichte, inspired by <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> his home. (Allemannische is the spelling he used; normally it has just one [...] "l".) The 32 poems [...] "for friends of the rural way of life" [...] were written in Alemannic, the local dialect of Wiesental. Hebel could not find a Basel publisher willing to produce the book in Alemannic, and the collection was only published in 1803 by Philip Macklot in Karlsruhe, after Hebel and his friends managed to collect enough advance subscriptions. The first edition was published anonymously, possibly because Hebel was concerned about getting a rustic image.|$|E
500|$|Although Game of Thrones was {{dismissed}} by some critics before it began, its {{success has been}} credited {{with an increase in}} the popularity of fantasy themes. On the eve of the second season's premiere, a CNN.com blog post by Joel Williams read, [...] "After this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of epic fantasy" [...] and cited Ian Bogost as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with Peter Jackson's 2001 The Lord of the Rings film trilogy and the Harry Potter films establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are [...] "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture". Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.|$|E
500|$|The burial {{customs of}} the ancient Romans were {{influenced}} by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of Magna Graecia and the Etruscans. [...] The original Roman custom was cremation, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a columbarium; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses. [...] From about the 2nd centuryCE, inhumation (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it. [...] Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a stela, or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, {{where it would be}} very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead. [...] Often a couple are shown, signifying <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see married couple funerary reliefs).|$|E

500|$|Marie {{gave birth}} to her first child, Prince Carol, only nine months after the marriage, on 15 October 1893. Although Marie {{requested}} the use of chloroform in order to ease the pains of labour, doctors were reluctant to do so, believing that [...] "women must pay in agony for the sins of Eve". After Marie's mother and Queen Victoria insisted, King Carol eventually allowed the use of the drug on his niece-in-law. Marie did not derive much joy from the arrival of her firstborn, later writing that she [...] "felt like turning [...] head to the wall". Similarly, although Marie was constantly reminded by Carol's wife Elisabeth that childbirth is [...] "the most glorious moment in [...] life", she could only feel <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> her mother at the birth of her second child, Princess Elisabeth, in 1894. After becoming accustomed to life in Romania, Marie began to rejoice at the births of her children, namely Princess Maria (1900–61), nicknamed [...] "Mignon" [...] in the family, Prince Nicholas (1903–78), nicknamed [...] "Nicky", Princess Ileana (1909–91) and Prince Mircea (1913–16).|$|E

The band's songs tend to be very guitar-heavy, often accompanied by piano or synthesizer. The theme in most of their songs is love, frequently lost love; songs like [...] "This Love", [...] "Makes Me Wonder" [...] and [...] "Misery" [...] have a very cynical tone, often expressing dissatisfaction with a relationship, while their more heartfelt and emotional songs such as [...] "She Will Be Loved" [...] and [...] "Never Gonna Leave This Bed" [...] express <b>a</b> <b>longing</b> <b>for</b> a romantic relationship. [...] "Makes Me Wonder" [...] has a secondary theme, in which Levine expresses his disillusionment and frustration with the state of American politics and the Iraq War.|$|E

[...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Rilke {{uses the}} images of love and of lovers {{as a way of}} showing mankind's {{potential}} and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. [...] In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes that [...] "Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air." [...] (Liebende könnten, verstünden sie's, in der Nachtluft / wunderlich reden.) He depicts [...] "the inadequacy of ordinary lovers" [...] and contrasts a feminine form of [...] "sublime love" [...] and a masculine [...] "blind animal passion."

[...] He notices a [...] "decline in the lives of lovers... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving." [...] Later, during World War I, he would lament that [...] "the world has fallen into the hands of men." [...] In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity—that [...] "the nature of every ultimate love... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite." ...|$|E

But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.'
