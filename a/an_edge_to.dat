5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|In England's reply, captain Alastair Cook {{played in}} a fashion {{reminiscent}} of the man he had replaced for the tour, Strauss, as he played an accumulatory innings to score 64. Kieswetter, who had been brought into the team to provide firepower {{at the start of}} the innings was outscored by Cook 4 to 1, and was nearly dismissed twice in his first over, offering <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, and two balls later he was caught in front, but umpire Rod Tucker ruled that he was not out. Kieswetter was dismissed in the 13th over for 19, completely missing a drive; presenting Mushfiqur with an easy stumping. An over later, Kevin Pietersen fell for just one run, leaving England on 74/2. Cook and new man Collingwood put on 22 runs before the opener was adjudged leg before wicket (LBW) though replays indicated that the ball was missing the stumps on the leg side. Collingwood then anchored the chase with Eoin Morgan, the pair adding 88 runs to the score. After the dismissal of Morgan on 33, it was left to Prior to join Collingwood to add the required runs, and England won with four overs to spare.|$|E

25|$|In graph theory, the Hadwiger {{conjecture}} (or Hadwiger's conjecture) states that, if all proper colorings of an {{undirected graph}} G use k or more colors, then {{one can find}} k disjoint connected subgraphs of G such that each subgraph is connected by <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> each other subgraph. Contracting the edges within each of these subgraphs so that each subgraph collapses to a single vertex produces a complete graph Kk on k vertices as a minor of G.|$|E
25|$|The {{third day}} saw {{a total of}} 17 wickets fall, with Shane Warne and Andrew Flintoff being the leading {{performers}} for their sides. First up, Brett Lee grabbed three wickets in 12 minutes: Trescothick slashed a wide delivery and got <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> the keeper, captain Vaughan got his third single-figure score in the series as he failed to cover his stumps to a straight one, and nightwatchman Hoggard edged to Hayden in the slips for 1.|$|E
25|$|The reverse tactic can be used, by {{fast and}} slow bowlers alike, by placing {{seven or eight}} fielders on the off side and bowling far outside off stump. The batsman can safely allow the ball to pass without fear of it hitting the stumps, but will not score. If they want to score {{they will have to}} try and risk <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> a wide ball and hit through the packed off side, or trying and drag the ball from far outside the stumps to the sparsely-populated leg side.|$|E

25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of Atlantic Cod include engine power vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine power vessels had larger nets, larger engines, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic Cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|E
25|$|So, {{with the}} score at 75 for 6, England once again needed a big partnership, {{this time from}} Flintoff and wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The pair saw England to lunch, but Flintoff had {{suffered}} a shoulder injury and looked in obvious pain. In the first over after lunch, Jones gave <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> Ponting – seven down for 101. Giles batted responsibly, padding up to Warne, but eventually {{felt the need to}} play at one, which Hayden held with relative ease. Harmison came and went, facing one delivery, and it was all up to Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to see England to a challenging target.|$|E
25|$|If S is a maximal {{independent}} set in some graph, it is a maximal clique or maximal complete subgraph in {{the complementary}} graph. A maximal clique {{is a set}} of vertices that induces a complete subgraph, and that is not a subset of the vertices of any larger complete subgraph. That is, it is a set S such that every pair of vertices in S is connected by an edge and every vertex not in S is missing <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> at least one vertex in S. A graph may have many maximal cliques, of varying sizes; finding the largest of these is the maximum clique problem.|$|E

25|$|Less than {{a half-hour}} in, shortly after Flintoff got his half-century, McGrath took Collingwood's wicket off <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> Gilchrist. Within 20minutes, Lee took the wickets of Chris Read {{for two and}} Sajid Mahmood for a duck off {{consecutive}} balls, reducing England to 257 for 7. Flintoff and Steve Harmison stayed at the crease for 25 runs before Harmison was given out lbw to Clark. Just before the lunch break, Flintoff fell for 89 after trying to slog Clark but edging to Gilchrist. A clearly out-of-sorts Shane Warne was {{able to pick up}} his 1000th international wicket to end the England innings on 291, trapping Monty Panesar lbw for a duck.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss {{and chose}} to bat on a wicket which some {{commentators}} suggesting the flattest ever at the Adelaide Oval. David Warner made a blistering {{start with the}} score at 0/40 after 4 overs. But Chris Rogers (9) fell shortly after from <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> Shikhar Dhawan bowled by Ishant Sharma. Shane Watson (14) also fell to Dhawan via an edge. Michael Clarke steadied the innings while Warner scored his 10th century off 106 balls. Clarke (60) eventually retired hurt after a back injury. Karn Sharma took his first Test wicket after David Warner (145) holed out. Australia lost late wickets in the last session, losing 4 wickets to end the day at 6/354 after at one stage being 3/345. Brad Haddin (0) was dismissed on the last ball of the day.|$|E
25|$|Although Xp {{necessarily}} includes {{at least}} one forest, {{it is not true}} that all graphs in Xp are forests: for instance, X1 consists of two graphs, a seven-vertex tree and the triangle K3. However, the set of trees in Xp may be precisely characterized: these trees are exactly the trees that can be formed from three trees in X'p−1 by connecting a new root vertex by <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> an arbitrarily chosen vertex {{in each of the three}} smaller trees. For instance, the seven-vertex tree in X1 is formed in this way from the two-vertex tree (a single edge) in X0. Based on this construction, the number of forbidden minors in X'p can be shown to be at least (p!)2. The complete set X2 of forbidden minors for pathwidth-2 graphs has been computed; it contains 110 different graphs.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas ran for 257 yards, and Ole Miss QB Eli Manning {{threw for}} 414 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. The first {{points of the}} game came for the Rebels when Matt Jones was called for {{intentionally}} grounding in the end zone, which by rule is scored a safety. Ole Miss gained a 2–0 lead, but fumbled near {{the close of the}} first quarter, resulting in a Razorback field goal. Lerinezo Robinson for the Hogs then returned a fumbled kickoff eight yards for a touchdown, giving Arkansas a 10–2 lead. Jonathan Nichols of Ole Miss then hit a 48-yard field, but a Jimmy Beasley interception of Eli Manning set up Arkansas for a 34-yard option keep touchdown by Matt Jones, giving <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> the Hogs, 17–5. Manning then connected with Justin Sawyer, but the two point play was no good. First a field goal, then a touchdown closed out the first half for the Razorbacks, the TD set up by a 55-yard punt return by Decori Birmingham, to the Ole Miss 20.|$|E
25|$|The two Indians {{continued}} to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The {{only time in}} which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's head for a four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, just when it seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman flashed a short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not {{get his hands on}} the ball, and it went away through third man for a four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.|$|E
25|$|With that, England's {{lead was}} set at 467, necessitating a record-breaking innings from New Zealand {{if they were to}} win the game. Realistically, with heavy weather {{expected}} on the final day, their only hope was to hold out for a draw. However, they still had the best part of five sessions to negotiate to do so, and the loss of Fulton (5) to Broad in the eighth over was not the best of starts. Swann then claimed the wickets of Williamson (3) and Rutherford (42) before the tea break. New Zealand lost three more {{before the end of the}} day; Brownlie (25) went first to Finn after a 79-run stand with Taylor, who made a valuable 70 before he and Guptill were dismissed by Swann as the day drew to a close with New Zealand still 309 behind on 158, with just four wickets in hand. The weather on the final day was as expected, with rain delaying the start by 45 minutes. It was only delaying the inevitable, however, as Broad caught McCullum off his own bowling in the third full over of the day, and Swann broke up a 56-run partnership between Southee and Bracewell, tempting Southee into <b>an</b> <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> slip for his 15th Test five-for before another bout of rain forced an early lunch. Swann got his 10th wicket of the match shortly after the resumption of play, dismissing Bracewell for 19, before Anderson wrapped up the victory and the series with the wicket of Boult for a 24-ball duck.|$|E
