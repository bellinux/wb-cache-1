40|$|The {{amount of}} data from {{languages}} spoken {{all over the world}} is rapidly increasing. Traditional manual methods in historical linguistics need to face the challenges brought by this influx of data. <b>Automatic</b> <b>approaches</b> to word comparison could provide invaluable help to pre-analyze data which can be later enhanced by experts.

Using a newly compiled database of expert cognate judgments across five different language families, we compare how well different <b>automatic</b> <b>approaches</b> distinguish related from unrelated words.

It is an {{individual}} system with the input {{in the form of}} a range data set and a color perception image of a human face. To derive the information needed to instantly synthesize a lifelike facial model, these two sources are processed separately. Such data portray the anatomical sites of features and the geometrical data of the face. The boundaries of facial features and the attributes of facial textures are resulted from the information taken away from the facial color image. A volumetric facial model is produced by these two sources when integrated. The two methods of feature localization may be utilized by the concept of deformable template， and the technique of chromatic edge detection.There are many uses for a human face model such as for medicine, identification, computer animation, and intelligent coding.|$|E

5000|$|Technical analysis, {{also known}} as [...] "charting", {{has been a part}} of {{financial}} practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysisthe presence of geometric shapes in historical price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness of technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distributionconditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottomswe find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value.|$|E
50|$|An <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> {{to making}} human face models is proposed. It is a {{separate}} system with the input {{in the form of}} a range of data sets and a colour image of a human face. These two sources are processed individually to derive the information necessary to automatically synthesize a lifelike facial model. The information obtained from the facial range data set includes the anatomical sites of features and the geometrical data of the face. The information extracted from the facial colour image is the boundaries of facial features and the attributes of facial textures. These two sources are integrated to produce a volumetric facial model. The range imaging system contains benefits such as having problems become avoided through contact measurement. This would be easier to keep and is much safer. Other advantages also include how it is needless to calibrate when measuring an object of similarity, and also that the machine would be appropriate for facial range data measurement.|$|E
5000|$|At that time, Autoland {{had lower}} {{priority}} because efforts were concentrated on other projects including rapid landing of aircraft for RAF Fighter Command, visual aids for pilots, runway approach lighting and an approach aid using DME with Barbro. That changed when Operational Requirement 947 (OR947) for automatic {{landing on the}} V-Force bomber fleet was issued in 1954. [...] At that time the V-bomber force was the UK's main contribution to the strategic nuclear power of the west [...] and all-weather operation was essential. There was also renewed interest in automatic landing for civil aviation. As {{the next step in}} the development, the flare-out and coupling units from the Devon were linked to a Smiths Type D autopilot and installed in Varsity WF417, a much larger aircraft, capable of carrying 38 people rather than 10 in the Devon. The first fully <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> and landing was made by WF417 on 11 November 1954 under calm and misty conditions. [...] A similar system was installed in Canberra WE189 to provide the first application of Autoland to jet-type aircraft.

Development of auto-flare and automatic kicking-off drift was continued at RAF Wittering, but in September that year WE189, returning from tests at Wittering, crashed due to engine failure on an approach when returning to its base at Martlesham Heath.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the bi-directional prospective link between automatic alcohol-approach tendencies and alcohol use {{in a group of}} young adolescents (mean age = 13. 6 years). The adolescents {{in the present study were}} assumed to be at-risk of early alcohol use and later problem drinking. It was hypothesized that alcohol use and <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies would reinforce one another particularly in the absence of well-developed inhibition skills. Methods: A total of 347 adolescents (N = 279 at follow-up) from special secondary education, a risk group for the development of substance use problems, participated in the study. <b>Automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies were assessed with the alcohol-approach avoidance task, inhibition skills were assessed with the Stroop task, and alcohol used was measured using a self-report measure. Results: Zero-inflated Poisson analysis revealed a significant effect of <b>automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies predicting alcohol use 6 months later, although only for adolescents with weaker inhibition skills. Conclusions: <b>Automatic</b> <b>approach</b> tendencies predict future drinking behavior of young adolescents with relatively weak inhibition skills. The findings of the present study have important implications for alcohol interventions for adolescents.
