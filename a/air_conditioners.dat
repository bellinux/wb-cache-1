The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale.

40|$|Abstract: Energy {{conservation}} becomes {{most important}} thing in the world. Use of <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> increases day by day by the people. We know that <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> consumes more power. One efficient way to reduce power consumption in <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> is by dehumidifying heat pipes. <b>Air</b> <b>conditioner</b> with heat pipes can eliminate the need for reheat or desiccant system and increase the dehumidifying capacity of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> by as much as 91 %. This technology uses about 50 % less energy than the electric reheat system and about 25 % less than other types of reheat. This paper deals about how the heat pipe {{can be used in a}} <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> The incoming <b>air</b> is pre cooled to a lower temperature than the inlet.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reveal both the {{psychosomatic}} and the physical effects of local air velocity from an <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> using biomarkers which can be collected noninvasively. Salivary α-amylase activity (SAA) and salivary cortisol were used as the indexes of psychosomatic effects. The total protein (TP) collected from stratum corneum was used as an index of the physical condition of dry skin. A continuous experiment over a 5 days period in summer was conducted using 8 healthy young male adults for 2 -types of airflow conditioners, a whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (without local <b>air</b> velocity) and a normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> (with local <b>air</b> velocity). The subjects felt cool, windy, dry and uncomfortable when under the normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> as determined in a subjective evaluation. The SAA under the normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> fluctuated more widely than with the whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> The level of salivary cortisol decreased more in a day under the normal-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner</b> than with the whole ceiling-type <b>air</b> <b>conditioner.</b> These results showed that reducing local air velocity may provide more healthy psychosomatic conditions over the long-term. Moreover, the TP of a drying-exposed skin area showed a significant change during this experiment whereas the TP of drying-protected area was relatively unchanged. It was indicated that one week’s exposure to local air velocity conditions possibly influences the drying of facial skin. Thus, air movement at low velocity can be provides more comfortable conditions not only psychosomatically but also physically. [URL]...|$|R
