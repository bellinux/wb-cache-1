The underlying premise of the procedure is that the economy has a long run trajectory which is perturbed by various frictions. These are called wedges and the earliest version of the procedure includes <b>a</b> productivity <b>wedge,</b> <b>a</b> labor <b>wedge,</b> <b>an</b> investment <b>wedge</b> and <b>a</b> government consumption <b>wedge.</b> Business cycle accounting decomposes fluctuations in macroeconomic variables, such as GDP or employment, into fluctuations {{of each of these}} wedges (and their combinations).|$|R

5|$|The {{respective}} {{forces of}} the royal and baronial armies have been estimated to be 10,000 and 5,000 strong. Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point. The flanks of the royal army closed in on Montfort's, surrounding them. With Montfort confronted by a force twice the size of his own, on unfavourable ground, the battle rapidly turned into a massacre.|$|E

In this invention, a z-cut quartz polarization rotator is used to compensate the wavelength retardance introduced by the Porro prism. The polarization rotator rotates the polarization of the linear polarized beam with a designed angle that is independent of the orientation of the rotator. This unique property was used to combine the retardance compensation and a Risley prism to a single optical component: <b>a</b> <b>wedged</b> polarization rotator.

5|$|A {{distinct}} defining {{feature of}} a Surtseyan eruption is {{the formation of}} a pyroclastic surge (or base surge), a ground hugging radial cloud that develops along with the eruption column. Base surges are caused by the gravitational collapse of a vaporous eruptive column, one that is denser overall then a regular volcanic column. The densest part of the cloud is nearest to the vent, resulting <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> shape. Associated with these laterally moving rings are dune-shaped depositions of rock left behind by the lateral movement. These are occasionally disrupted by bomb sags, rock that was flung out by the explosive eruption and followed a ballistic path to the ground. Accumulations of wet, spherical ash known as accretionary lapilli is another common surge indicator.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, a {{group of}} Circassians from Sivas in Anatolia settled in Quneitra. This initial group did not {{cultivate}} the area {{for a number of}} years. A second wave of Circassians, numbering about 2,000, arrived in the Golan in 1878 via Acre after fleeing Bulgaria due to the Russo-Turkish War. Along with Quneitra, they settled or built number of other villages in the vicinity. The Circassians began farming the area and each family was given title to 70 to 130 dunams of land by the government depending on the family's size. The Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in the Golan as a means to drive <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> between the frequently rebellious Druze villages of Mount Hermon and those in Jabal Hauran. The Circassians of Quneitra engaged in sustained conflicts with the Druze and the Al Fadl through the remainder of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an attack}} on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was entrenched in the old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{influence}} of concomitant heeled footwear when wearing <b>a</b> lateral <b>wedged</b> insole for medial compartment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, between everyday walking shoes for outdoor use and socks or flat footwear without a heel for indoor use. DesignA total of 227 outpatients were prospectively randomized and treated with <b>a</b> neutral <b>wedged</b> insole inserted into shoes (placebo with shoes; n= 45), <b>a</b> <b>wedged</b> insole inserted into shoes (inserted insole with shoes; n= 45), a sock-type ankle supporter with <b>a</b> <b>wedged</b> insole when wearing socks or flat footwear (inserted insole without shoes; n= 46), a subtalar strapped insole when wearing shoes (strapped insole with shoes; n= 45), and the strapped insole with socks or flat footwear (strapped insole without shoes; n= 46). The Lequesne index of knee OA at week 12 was compared with the baseline in each treatment group. ResultsTwenty patients withdrew from the study, and the 207 patients who completed the 12 -week study were evaluated. At the final assessment, participants wearing the inserted insole without shoes (P= 0. 003), the strapped insole with shoes (P< 0. 0001), and the strapped insole without shoes (P< 0. 0001) demonstrated significantly improved Lequesne index scores in comparison with their baseline assessments. No {{significant differences were found}} in the placebo (P= 0. 16) or the inserted insole with shoes (P= 0. 2) groups. ConclusionConcomitant heeled footwear may decrease the efficacy of <b>an</b> inserted lateral <b>wedged</b> insole. The optimal usage of <b>a</b> lateral <b>wedged</b> insole for knee OA would be the combination with socks or flat footwear without heels...|$|R

5|$|Julian's {{best hope}} for a quick victory lay in a cavalry breakthrough. Not only was the German cavalry {{probably}} smaller than his own, but its lack of armour made it vulnerable to his armoured regiments, especially the cataphracts. If they could rout the enemy horse, his squadrons could then wheel and attack the German lines in the flank or rear, and the battle would {{be as good as}} won. Julian's cavalry would thus aim to deliver a shock charge, careering forward in <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> formation with the cataphracts forming the spearhead, the conventional armoured cavalry on either side and the light regiments on the extreme right, ready to block outflankers and to pursue fleeing enemy horse. The initial collision would shatter the enemy formation, and then the Germans could be overpowered in the ensuing melee. Failing a cavalry breakthrough, Julian would have to rely on a struggle of attrition on foot, in which superior Roman armour, training and formation discipline would almost inevitably prevail.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna.

On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian advanced guard approached Krivolak, thus creating <b>a</b> <b>wedge</b> between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania.

In a bayonet charge, the French took the hamlet of Wahlweiss, but Ferino's troops could not hold it and withdrew during the night. Jourdan then ordered a general withdrawal from the region, instructing his divisions to retreat along the lines of march they had followed into the region, and himself establishing a command post at Hornberg. He sent the cavalry to the western side of the Black Forest, where the horses could expect to find better forage.|$|E
