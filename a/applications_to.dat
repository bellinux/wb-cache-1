5|$|Compactification {{can be used}} to {{construct}} models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a Calabi–Yau manifold. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special space which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> string theory. It is named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{possible}} to exploit RNA interference in therapy. Although it is difficult to introduce long dsRNA strands into mammalian cells due to the interferon response, the use of short interfering RNA has been more successful.

RNAi has also been shown to be effective in reversing induced liver failure in mouse models.|$|E

These superalloys are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo Service Module.

5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons.

In addition, the ABJM theory serves as a semi-realistic simplified model for solving problems that arise in condensed matter physics.|$|E
