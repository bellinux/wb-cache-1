5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A <b>antagonist</b> <b>drug</b> ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] 1. The {{action of}} N- 2 '-chloroethyl-N-ethyl- 2 -methyl {{benzylamine}} (xylamine) on rat pineal gland sympathetic nnervation was examined. 2. This alkylating agent caused aconcentration-dependent increase in pineal gland N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity in neurologically intact pineal glands that was suppressed in glands previously subjected to bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy. 3. Xylamine-induced levations in NAT activity were attenuated by]Lnoradrenergic <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> {{but not by}} ~t-noradrenergic <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs.</b> 4. Since pineal gland uptake of radiolabelled norepinephrine (NE) was impaired by xylamine, the drug may increase pineal gland NAT activity by inhibiting NE reuptake into the presynaptic nerve terminal, thereby {{increasing the amount of}} the neurotransmitter available to stimulate pinealocyte fl-noradrenoceptors...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLeishmaniasis is endemic in Europe and the {{prevalence}} of latent infection in the Mediterranean region is high. Reports describing opportunistic leishmaniasis in European patients treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> are rapidly accumulating. For other granulomatous infections, risk of opportunistic disease varies by mode of TNF-alpha antagonism. This study explores whether this {{may also be the}} case for leishmaniasis. We ascertained the relative frequency of exposure to different TNF <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> among published cases of opportunistic leishmaniasis in Europe and compared this with the prescription of these drugs in Europe. We found that risk of opportunistic leishmaniasis is higher in patients receiving anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (infliximab or adalimumab) compared with patients treated with the TNF-receptor construct etanercept. Clinicians may want to consider these observations, which suggest that etanercept should be favoured over anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies in individuals living in or visiting areas endemic for leishmaniasis until evidence from prospective research is available. A European adverse event reporting system is required to identify rare opportunistic infections associated with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory biotherapies...|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{believe the}} {{neurological}} deficits common in JNCL {{could be due}} to overactive AMPA receptors in the cerebellum. To test this hypothesis, researchers administered AMPA <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> into affected mice. The motor skills of the affected mice showed significant improvement after the antagonist treatment, which supported the hypothesis that the neurological deficits in JNCL are due to overactive AMPA receptors. This research could eventually help to alleviate neurological deficits of JNCL in humans.|$|R
40|$|Results {{similar to}} those in Fig. 4 and 5 were also ob-tained for other sets of {{agonists}} and antagonists, asshown in Table I. That is, it is evident from their adsorption de-pendence on electrode potential, that the adsorptivity of the antagonists is stronger than that of agonists in the po-tential region more negative than the point of zero charge, and <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> are readily adsorbed onto a nega-tively charged surface. On a biomembrane, competitive in-hibitory effect for agonists and antagonists is caused by stereoselective and electrostatic interaction. A study of the electrosorption behavior of neurotransmitters and their <b>antagonist</b> <b>drugs</b> may provide basic information on the competitive inhibitory effects of antagonists on electro-static interactions of agonists with solvated and charged surfaces. The results of the present work are summarized as follows: 1. Adsorption potential profiles of neurotransmitters, their agonists and antagonists were obtained from specu-lar reflection measurements. 2. Neurotransmitters and their agonists gave similar ad-sorption potential profiles. 3. Antagonists have stronger adsorptivity than neuro-transmitters. 4. Adsorption study on drugs may give some clarifi-cation of electrostatic interactions ofdrug-receptor sites. Acknowledgments M. S. K. Ito is gratefully acknowledged for his assist-ance.

50|$|Decanoic acid {{acts as a}} non-competitive AMPA {{receptor}} antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, {{and this}} is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects. This direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by decanoic acid in the brain contributes to the anticonvulsant effect of the MCT ketogenic diet.
