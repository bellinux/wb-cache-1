5|$|In a 1959 essay, Boris Pasternak {{compared}} Shakespeare's Macbeth to Raskolnikov, {{the protagonist}} of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Pasternak explained that neither character begins as a murderer, but becomes one {{by a set of}} faulty rationalizations and <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> he is above the law.|$|E
5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Swargadwar is {{the name}} given to the {{cremation}} ground or burning ghat which {{is located on the}} shores of the sea. Here thousands of dead bodies of Hindus brought from faraway places are cremated.

While they were market leaders at the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart, and Pan Am all experienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses when it introduced New Coke in 1985, but soon regained market share.|$|E
5|$|For many centuries, {{the people}} within the Nri hegemony were {{committed}} to peace. This religious pacifism was rooted in <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> violence was an abomination which polluted the earth. Instead, the eze Nri could declare a form of excommunication from the odinani Nri against those who violated specific taboos. Members of the Ikénga could isolate entire communities via this form of ritual siege.|$|E
5|$|From 1951 to 1963, Stevens {{served as}} {{vice-president}} of the Lucy Stone League, though she struggled with maintaining militancy. Stevens was not anti-male, rather pro-female. She {{did not follow}} <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> for women to succeed, men had to be omitted; rather, she believed that collaboration with men was essential. In her last years, Stevens supported the establishment of feminist studies as a legitimate field of academic inquiry in American universities and tried to establish a Lucy Stone Chair of Feminism at Radcliffe College.|$|E
50|$|Saudi Arabia {{is one of}} the few Muslim {{countries}} in which women are forced to cover in most parts of the country.

5|$|In 1687, William Penn {{published}} The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: {{being the}} birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England, which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil. Penn's comments reflected Coke's, indicating <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Magna Carta was a fundamental law. The colonists drew on English law books, {{leading them to}} an anachronistic interpretation of Magna Carta, believing that it guaranteed trial by jury and habeas corpus.|$|E
5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is a good omen.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics of New World Order {{conspiracy}} theories accuse its proponents of indulging in the furtive fallacy, <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> significant facts of history are necessarily sinister; conspiracism, a world view that centrally places {{conspiracy theories}} in {{the unfolding of}} history, rather than social and economic forces; and fusion paranoia, a promiscuous absorption of fears from any source whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|The Melanau are {{a native}} people of Sarawak {{that lived in}} areas {{primarily}} around the modern city of Mukah, where they worked as fishermen and craftsmen as well renowned boat-builders. Historically the Melanau practised Animism, <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> spirits inhabited objects in their environment, and while this is still practised today, most Melanau have since been converted to Christianity and Islam.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, {{who opposed}} the war out of doctrinaire cynicism and <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E
5|$|The Third Amendment {{has been}} invoked {{in a few}} {{instances}} as helping establish an implicit right to privacy in the Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along {{with others in the}} Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which cited the Third Amendment as implying <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of any visits by eminent people to the castle, although there is <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the upkeep of its chapel.

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|An eagle’s {{appearance}} in the sky when thunderclouds threatened was greeted with joy and hope by people who trusted {{in their power to}} defeat an ala; after defeating the ala, the eagle led the clouds away from the fields. An explanation for this, recorded in eastern Serbia, is that the eagles which nest in the vicinity of a village want thunderstorms and hail as far as possible from their nestlings, so coincidentally protect the village’s fields as well. The role of eagles, however, was controversial, because in the same region there was <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> an eagle flying in front of thunderstorm clouds was a manifestation of an ala, leading the clouds toward the crops, rather than driving them away.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that,</b> once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and <b>a</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
