50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Wigglesworth {{investigated}} the ballistic resistance of 3 mm. and 2 mm. thicknesses of <b>allyl</b> <b>resin</b> and tempered glass {{as a function}} of the diameter of a small steel ball, impact velocity, and curvature of the lens.|$|E
50|$|The {{coupling}} of {{a terminal}} alkyne and an aromatic ring is the pivotal reaction {{when talking about}} applications of the copper-promoted or copper-free Sonogashira reaction. The list of cases where the typical Sonogashira reaction using aryl halides has been employed is large, and choosing illustrative examples is difficult. A recent use of this methodology is shown below for the coupling of iodinated phenylalanine with a terminal alkyne derived from d-biotin using an in situ generated Pd(0) species as catalyst, which allowed the preparation of alkynelinked phenylalanine derivative for bioanalytical applications. There are also examples of the coupling partners both being attached to <b>allyl</b> <b>resins,</b> with the Pd(0) catalyst effecting cleavage of the substrates and subsequent Sonogashiracoupling in solution.|$|R
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of implantable neural probes has increased {{during the last}} 10 years, starting with stiff materials such as silicone to more flexible materials like polyimide. We have developed a novel polymer based on Off-Stoichiometry Thiol-Enes + Epoxy (OSTE+, consisting of a thiol, two <b>allyls,</b> an epoxy <b>resin</b> and two initiators), which is up to 100 times more flexible than polyimide. Since a flexible neural probe should be more biocompatible than a stiff probe, an OSTE+ probe should be more biocompatible than one composed of a more rigid material. We have investigated the toxicity of OSTE+ {{as well as of}} OSTE+ that had been incubated in water for a week (OSTE+H 2 O) using MTT assays with mouse L 929 fibroblasts. We found that OSTE+ showed cytotoxicity, but OSTE+H 2 O did not. Extracts were analyzed using LC-MS and GC-MS in order to identify leaked chemicals...|$|R
