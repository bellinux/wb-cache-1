5|$|In Argentina, Cabernet Sauvignon {{lags behind}} Malbec as the country's main red grape but its numbers are growing. The varietal {{versions}} often have lighter fruit flavors and <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes. In recent years, {{there have been}} increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.|$|E

Magician Ricky Jay popularized throwing cards within the sleight of hand industry {{with the release of}} his 1977 book entitled Cards as Weapons, which was met with large sales and critical acclaim. Some magic tricks, both close-up and on stage, are heavily connected to throwing cards.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune her now deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys <b>are</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E
