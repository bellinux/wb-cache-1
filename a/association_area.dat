40|$|The {{pure tone}} task {{activated}} the TTG. The 1000 -Hz tone activated significantly more pixels in the TTG {{than did the}} 4000 -Hz tone. The 4000 -Hz tone activated pixels primarily in the medial TTG, whereas the 1000 -Hz tone activated more pixels in the lateral TTG. Higher intensity tones activated significantly more pixels than did lower intensity tones at the same frequency. The stepped tones activated more pixels than the pure tones, but {{the difference was not}} significant. The text task produced significantly more activation than did the pure tones in the TTG and in the auditory <b>association</b> <b>areas.</b> The more complex tasks (stepped tones and listening to text) tended to activate more pixels in the left hemisphere than in the right, whereas the simpler tasks activated similar numbers of pixels in each hemisphere. CONCLUSION: Auditory stimuli activate the TTG and the <b>association</b> <b>areas.</b> Activation in the primary auditory cortex depends on frequency, intensity, and complexity of the auditory stimulus. Activation of the auditory <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> requires more complex auditory stimuli, such as the stepped tone task or text reading...|$|R

40|$|Brain signals {{recorded}} {{from the}} primary motor cortex (M 1) are known to serve {{a significant role in}} coding the information brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) need to perform real and imagined movements, and also to form several functional networks with motor <b>association</b> <b>areas.</b> However, whether functional networks between M 1 and other brain regions, such as these motor <b>association</b> <b>areas,</b> are related to performance of BMIs is unclear. To examine the relationship between functional connectivity and performance of BMIs, we analyzed the correlation coefficient between performance of neural decoding and functional connectivity over the whole brain using magnetoencephalography. Ten healthy participants were instructed to execute or imagine three simple right upper limb movements. To decode the movement type, we extracted 40 virtual channels in the left M 1 via the beamforming approach, and used them as a decoding feature. In addition, seed-based functional connectivities of activities in the alpha band during real and imagined movements were calculated using imaginary coherence. Seed voxels were set as the same virtual channels in M 1. After calculating the imaginary coherence in individuals, the correlation coefficient between decoding accuracy and strength of imaginary coherence was calculated over the whole brain. The significant correlations were distributed mainly to motor <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> for both real and imagined movements. These regions largely overlapped with brain regions that had significant connectivity to M 1. Our results suggest that use of the strength of functional connectivity between M 1 and motor <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> has the potential to improve the performance of BMIs to perform real and imagined movements...|$|R

During tasks that required auditory localization both the sighted and blind subjects strongly activated posterior parietal areas. In addition, the blind subjects activated <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> in the right occipital cortex, the foci of which were similar to areas previously identified in visual location and motion detection experiments in sighted subjects.

40|$|The neocortex {{consists}} of histochemically, connectionally, and functionally distinguishable areas. Recently, molecular biological techniques have {{enabled us to}} find rare types of genes expressed in specific neocortical areas. We previously reported occ 1 gene as preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex (V 1), using the differential display method. Here, by differential display, we found selective and strong expression of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene, in higher-order <b>association</b> <b>areas.</b> In V 1, RBP mRNA was expressed only in the superficial part of layer II, but its ex-pression increased, involving deeper layers, along the visual path-way. In visual <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> such as TE, RBPmRNAwas strongly expressed in both supra- and infragranular layers. In primary audi-tory and somatosensory areas, as in V 1, RBP expression was low, and restricted to {{the upper part of}} the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of RBP expression is in marked contrast with that of occ 1; and in early visual areas where both genes are ex-pressed, these occur in distinct sublayers within the supragranular layers. In neonatal monkeys, the area-specific expression pattern of RBP was less distinct, suggesting that the characteristic expres-sion of RBP in higher-order <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> is mainly established postnatally...|$|R

Based on previous findings of statistical and functional evidence of epistatic interactions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we evaluated our samples for similar associations and, in addition, examined epistatic interactions of RGS 4 and COMT polymorphisms on grey matter volumes among SZ and healthy subjects (HS). We attempted to replicate the previous findings by examining structural MRI scans from 21 ﬁrst-episode, antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder subjects and 19 healthy subjects using both hypothesis free and hypothesis driven tests for interaction. We did this using voxel-based morphometry to examine grey matter alterations associated with COMT and RGS 4 risk alleles both independently and interactively. At the whole brain level, we observed RGS 4 rs 2842018 and COMT rs 4818 interactions in the posterior cingulate, insular, occipital, and temporal regions. The most consistent finding among all interactions was grey matter reductions at the inferior and superior temporal gyri, corresponding to the heteromodal <b>association</b> <b>areas,</b> suggesting that RGS 4 and COMT variations are independently and epistatically associated with grey matter reductions at the dorsal components of heteromodal <b>association</b> <b>areas.</b> Previous <b>associations</b> of functional interaction between COMT and RGS 4 with altered working memory performance and BOLD responses at the prefrontal cortex in SZ may be mediated by structural changes in the dorsal heteromodal <b>association</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{activation}} of visual <b>association</b> <b>areas</b> and even primary visual cortex with auditory tasks in early blind subjects. Blindness occurring later in life was associated with less cross-modal plasticity as compared to early blindness. We examined one late blind and 9 sighted musicians with absolute pitch (AP) performing a pitch memory task which was contrasted with a motor control task. In the pitch memory task subjects had to compare the last or second last tone with the first tone and made a decision whether these tones were same or different after a visual prompt (sighted subjects) or a tactile prompt (blind subject). The motor control task was a rest condition with alternating button presses after a visual (sighted) or tactile (blind) prompt. To avoid interference with the MR scanner noise, a sparse temporal sampling fMRI-method with a long TR (17 sec) was used.
