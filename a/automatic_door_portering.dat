In a pilot study, participants (N= 48) who walked past a physical gesturing door were asked to fill out a questionnaire about that experience. In our follow-up study, participants (N= 51) viewed 12 video clips depicting a person walking toward and past an <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> that moved with different speeds and trajectories. In both studies, our Likert-scale measures and open-ended responses indicate that participants viewing the door behavior prototypes show significant uniformity in the interpretation of the door’s behavior, and that they attribute these motions as gestures with human-like characteristics such as cognition and intent...|$|R
