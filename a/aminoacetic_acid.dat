40|$|A {{fluorescent}} aminoacid {{was designed}} for selective and sensitive detection of Cu(II) in aqueous solution. The designing of this Cu(II) fluorescent chemosensing molecule, N-(1 -naphthyl) <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (NAA), {{was based on the}} binding of Cu(B) to <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> and the novel charge transfer photophysics of 1 -aminonaphthalenes. The fluorescence of NAA was found quenched by Cu (H) and several other metal ions of similar electronic structure such as Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II). The quenching was shown to occur via electron transfer within the metal-NAA complex, which required an optimal combination of high binding affinity and favorable redox properties of the components in the metal-NAA complex and hence afforded selective fluorometric detection of Cu(II). The calibration graph obeyed Stern-Volmer theory and was shown for Cu(II) over the range of 0 - 2. 75 x 10 (- 4) mol/L. The quenching constant of Cu(II) was measured as 8. 0 x 10 (3) mol/L that was two orders of magnitude higher than those of Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II). The 3 SD limit of detection for Cu(II) was 8. 00 x 10 (- 6) mol/L with a coefficient of variation of 1. 65 %. Linear range for quantitative detection of Cu (II) was 2. 67 x 10 (- 5) - 2. 75 x 10 (- 4) mol/L. The method was applied to synthetic sample measurements which gave recoveries of 105 %- 112 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{dispersion}} of aqueous suspensions on the dispersion properties of industrial Al 2 O 3 nanopowders with an average particle size of 50, 140 and 250 nm was investigated. Using ultrasound and/or {{with the addition of}} citric and <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acids</b> (0, 5, 5 and 10 g・L- 1), it has been shown the low aggregation stability of chosen particles in watering medium. The aggregative stability of the particles increased with decreasing particle size. Regardless of surfactant type and the initial particle size, concentration increase of carboxylic acids under the selected conditions had little effect on the degree of particle dispersion. Reducing the acidity of the medium (from 10 to 3 of pH units) contributed to the enhanced aggregation of nanoparticles...|$|R
40|$|Applications of {{industrial}} nanopowders {{are limited by}} the lack of information about their adsorption properties in aqueous solutions of surfactants. The adsorption coefficient of <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acids</b> in aqueous suspensions of nanosized (40 nm) and microsized (200 nm) ZnO particles was determined in the research. It has been experimentally shown that the coefficient of surfactant adsorption depends on the aging time, the nature of the surfactant {{and the size of the}} particles being studied. An increase of the adsorption coefficient is characteristic for all particles through the series "glutamic acid-lysine-glycine". As the specific surface area of plasma-chemical particles increases, the adsorption coefficient decreases: at 60 -min exposure in the "Glut-Lys-Gly" series, the Ads coefficient is " 0, 3 ‒ 0, 7 ‒ 1, 5 mM/m 2 " and " 0, 9 ‒ 2, 6 ‒ 7, 5 mM/m 2 for ZnO- 40 and ZnO- 200, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} and formulate fast disintegrating tablets (FDTs) for nausea and vomiting using <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> carmellose and sodium alginate with enough mechanical strength. Ondansetron HCl (water soluble) or domperidone (water insoluble) drug were added to FDTs and their disintegration behaviour was evaluated. Plackett Burman Screening Design was used to screen the independent active process variables [concentration of <b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (X 1), concentration of carmellose (X 2) and tablet crushing strength (X 3) ] which were found to actively influence the dependent variables [disintegration time in the mouth (DT), wetting time (WT), and water absorption ratio (WAR) ] for both the drugs. Also, the coefficients of active variables (DT, WT and WAR) of FDTs containing domperidone was found to be significantly different (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) from the coefficients of active factors (X 1, X 2 and X 3) containing ondansetron HCl FDTs. Further, FDTs containing domperidone was prepared according to central composite design for estimating the effect of active factors (X 1, X 2, X 3) in extended spherical domain. The regression analysis of quadratic fit revealed that DT, WT and WAR were 98 % correlated with active factors (X 1, X 2 or X 3). The optimized domperidone FDTs were further compared with superdisintegrants (croscarmellose sodium or crospovidone). The data revealed that optimized domperidone FDTs were better than domperidone FDTs containing croscarmellose or crospovidone. Hence, this novel excipients combination can be used for delivery of water insoluble drugs in place of superdisintegrants...|$|E

40|$|Current {{interest}} in {{disease of the}} muscles has emphasized the need for information concerning chemical changes within affected muscle. For this reason we have analyzed during {{the past four years}} specimens of muscles of patients suffering from primary progressive muscular dystrophy and other diseases involving the musculature. Aside from the desirability of securing data for theoretical purposes, it was our object also to learn whether changes occurring in these diseases were sufficiently characteristic to be applied for differential diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Our studies were planned in conjunction with therapeutic trials of glycine and other agents in muscular dystrophy. When possible, specimens were secured before, during, and after treatment for the purpose of ascertaining effects upon the composition of muscle. Our observations have been discussed, in part, in an earlier report (17) dealing with treatment of progressive muscular dystrophy, although publication of chemical data was deferred pending investigation of additional patients. The present paper describes the results of chemical examinations made upon patients whose histories were included in the report men-tioned as well as others studied subsequently.

40|$|Cesium Recovery from Ores. Adaptation of the phenol {{extraction}} (Phenex) {{process to}} {{the recovery of}} cesium from ore leach liquors continued to show promise. In roast-leach tests, 98 to 99 % of the cesium was dissolved from pollucite ore by roasting the ore at 800 deg C with 1. 8 parts of Na/sub 2 /CO/sub 3 / plus 1. 2 parts of NaCl and leaching with water. More than 99 % of the cesium was recovered from the leach liquor and separated from other alkali metals by extracting with 4 -sec-butyl- 2 -(alpha -methylbenzyl) phenol (BAMBP) in diisopropylbenzene and stripping with hydrochloric acid. Santophen- 1 also extracted cesium effectively, but, because of the limited solubility of the cesiumSantophen- 1 complex in the diluent, the utility of this phenol in ore processing is questionable. Separation of Alkali Metals. The extraction and separation of alkali metals from nitrate solutions was studied with several different types of extractants, including substituted phenols, alkylphosphoric acids, sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, and mixtures of some of these. With all of these reagents, cesium was extracted more strongly than rubidium, which in turn was extracted more strongly than the other alkali metals. Separation factors were higher with the phenols than with the other extractants. Acid Recovery by Amine Extraction. Preliminary tests showed the potential usefulness of tertiary amines for recovering and purifying phosphoric acid from the highly contaminated wet-process acid produced in the fertilizer industry. Water stripping of the amine solvent yielded a product {{that was more than}} 1. 5 M in H/ sub 2 /PO/sub 6 / and was almost free of iron and aluminum. Final-Cycle Plutonium Recovery by Amine Extraction. Batch equilibration tests with both aged and fresh samples of Purex-plant 1 BP solution showed that the aged but not the fresh samples contained a considerable quantity of zirconium-niobium species highly extractable by the hydrocarbon diluents used with amines and other extractants. The amounts of zirconium-niobium extractable from the aged solution were sufficient to account for the low decontamination previously obtained when aged plant 1 BP solution was used to continuous countercurrent testing of the plutonium- recovery flowsheets. Individual and batch cascade tests with the fresh plant solution showed separation and decontamination factors high enough for use in the projected process. Extraction of Lanthanides and Transplutoniums by Dialkylphosphoric Acids. The behavior of americium and curium relative to the lanthanides in extraction by di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) from carboxylic acids was shifted from the behavior in extractions from mineral acids, where americium is similar to promethium. The shift was greatest in extractions from oxydiacetic acid, where cerium was 4 times as extractable as americium, while differences within the element groups were very small. Extractions from nitric acid were increased by adding glycine (<b>aminoacetic</b> <b>acid).</b> Extractions were greatly reduced by adding a phenol to HDEHP.
