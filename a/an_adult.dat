5|$|From September 1939 to March 1940, Madgwick {{designed}} and managed <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> education scheme for the Sydney University Regiment, based at Menangle. As Australia in 1940 became increasingly involved in World War II and expanded its military forces, Madgwick and colleagues David Drummond, C.E.W. Bean, (Sir) Robert W. Wallace (Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney), Richard Charles Mills, W.G.K. Duncan, Alf A.J. Conlon, and others began to publicly {{call for the}} Australian Army to install <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> education program to combat illiteracy among its members and educate them in the political history of Australia. Beginning in May 1940 and culminating in a special conference on 20 August 1940, Madgwick and the others cooperatively drafted <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> education scheme for the Army.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers undergo {{incomplete}} metamorphosis: they repeatedly moult (undergo ecdysis), each instar becoming {{larger and}} more like <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> with the wing-buds increasing in size at each stage. The number of instars varies between species but is often six. After the final moult, the wings are inflated and become fully functional. The migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, spends about 25 to 30 days as a nymph, depending on sex and temperature, and lives for about 51 days as <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> stage.

This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Peter Galton and James A. Jensen {{described}} a fragmentary femur {{belonging to a}} hadrosauroid discovered in Arches National Park. Utah. Various hadrosauroid teeth had also been found in quarries of small vertebrates in the western region of the San Rafael Swell, near Castle Dale in Emery County, Utah; they were described in 1991 by J. Michael Parrish. Subsequently, in 1993, Carole Jones and her husband Ramal Jones discovered fragmentary bones in a fossil site located in the northwestern region of the Swell. They brought the site {{to the attention of}} Donald Burge, director of the institution then called the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum (CEUM). The site, which is formally known as CEUM Locality 42em366v, would subsequently be named Carol's Site (sic) in her honour. The fossils, stored under the specimen number CEUM 9758, represent the partial remains of <b>an</b> <b>adult</b> hadrosauroid, including parts of the skull, vertebrae, ischium, and leg. CEUM 5212, a partial skull and forelimb from <b>an</b> <b>adult,</b> was found nearby in CEUM Locality 42em369v.
