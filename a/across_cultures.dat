Social and cultural psychological research, however, suggests that jurors (and people generally) may not understand others’ mental states in ways consistent with legal standards. In this article, the author theoretically and empirically examines (<b>across</b> <b>culture)</b> how jurors understand defendants’ mental states, investigating whether they can apply mental state inquiries {{in a manner consistent}} with domestic and international policy goals. After testing several mental state variables, the author finds that the law’s hierarchy of mental states frequently does not match jurors’ psychological processes. Analysis <b>across</b> <b>culture</b> (US v. China) indicates that people from different cultural backgrounds make mental state judgments in systematically different ways. The author discusses policy implications both for American law as well as international law...|$|R

5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children <b>across</b> <b>cultures</b> studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E
40|$|Over 17, 000 {{participants}} responded to self-report measures of sexuality and personality {{as part of the}} International Sexuality Description Project. It was expected that romantic relationship infidelity would be associated with the personality traits of disagreeableness and a lack of conscientiousness <b>across</b> most <b>cultures.</b> Sexual promiscuity, on the other hand, was expected to relate to extraversion <b>across</b> most <b>cultures.</b> Analyses <b>across</b> 58 <b>cultures</b> from 52 nations revealed that romantic relationship infidelity was significantly associated with disagreeableness and low levels of conscientiousness <b>across</b> most <b>cultures.</b> Sexual promiscuity was related to extraversion across many, but not most, cultural regions. The expected pattern of findings was most strongly evident in South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania. In some world regions, such as Africa and East Asia, sexual promiscuity was completely unrelated to extraversion levels. Discussion questions focus on why regional differences in sexuality-personality linkages seem to exist...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{proliferation}} of online newspapers over recent years. Despite this, {{or perhaps because of}} it, factors affecting the quality of online newspapers remain only partially understood. Based on a two-factor model of hygiene and motivator factors, this paper examines quality for online newspapers giving attention to differences <b>across</b> <b>culture,</b> sex, and age. Hygiene factors are essential requirements whose absence causes dissatisfaction, while motivators are desirable elements that add value and increase user satisfaction. The paper presents findings from an empirical study of eighty-four Web users. Results show that hygiene factors for our respondents were: Timeliness, Content attractiveness, Content coverage, Usefulness, and Navigation, while motivators were: Writing style, Layout, Archives, Services, Interactivity, and Multimedia presentation. Four factors were borderline: Journalism ethics, Ease of use, Front page and headlines, and Locating information.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} examines and explores cross-cultural communication among first-year {{international and domestic}} students at Great Plains University, a large, four-year, research university located in the Midwestern United States. Specifically, this case study examines {{the ways in which}} first-year international and domestic students make decisions about whether and how to interact with one another <b>across</b> <b>culture</b> in the classroom. The literature review discusses both international and domestic students’ experiences and perceptions regarding intercultural communication, and also introduces a variety of barriers and facilitators of cross-cultural communication. Through introducing and relating cross-cultural communication to the goals of international education, the author asserts that cross-cultural communication is lacking on United States college campuses, and thus the goals of international education are not being fully realized. Therefore, the author seeks to understand how first-year international and domestic students make decisions regarding how to interact <b>across</b> <b>culture</b> in order for United States higher education to better facilitate cross-cultural communication throughout a student’s collegiate experience. Through classroom observations and one-on-one in-depth interviews with participants, main themes emerged that help to describe how first-year international and domestic students make decisions regarding how to interact with one another <b>across</b> <b>culture.</b> Findings indicated that both international and domestic students were primarily concerned with assessing the ease or convenience of engaging in cross-cultural communication, and used a variety of factors to make this assessment prior to deciding to initiate intercultural interactions. This research provides a model for Great Plains University to increase and enhance cross-cultural communication in the classroom and throughout the campus, offering recommendations for future research and best practices in higher education student affairs and international education.
