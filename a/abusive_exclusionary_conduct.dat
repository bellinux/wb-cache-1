40|$|Thanks to {{the reforms}} {{within the last}} 15 years, the forms-based {{approach}} of the European Union Competition Policy has evolved into an effects-based approach which gives importance to consumer welfare and economic analysis. One {{of the most important}} developments in this reform process is the publication of the Guidance on the Commission‘s Enforcement Priorities in Applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to <b>Abusive</b> <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings at the end of 2008. The main goal of the study is to discover how the transformation from forms-based approach into effects-based approach has reflected on Turkish Competition Authority decisions about predatory pricing, rebates, refusal to supply, margin squeeze and exclusive dealing agreements. In the name of these effects, relevant Turkish Competition Authority decisions on the abuse of dominant position in exclusionary practices between 2009 and 2013 have been evaluated under the light of European Union decisions and the Guidance. Consequently, {{it has been argued that}} after 2009, European Union is more consistent to adopt an effect-based approach. On the other hand, Turkish Competition Authority decisions do not show a consistent and clear tendency towards effects-based approach. However, Turkey takes European Union Competition Policy as a model to itself and the publication of The Draft for Guidance on the Assessment of <b>Abusive</b> <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings may show Turkey will follow more effects-based approach in the future. In such a case Turkish Competition Authority may be required to evaluate positive and negative sides of the guidance and whether Turkey really needs it...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> in two-sided {{markets with}} [indirect] network effects is {{investigated}} in this dissertation. The dissertation addresses these issues by making three main contributions. First, a profitability function for independent South African community newspaper businesses is quantified {{and used to}} consider the effectiveness of possible exclusionary strategies. For <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> to be an attractive mechanism for a dominant firm it must undermine the ability of independent newspapers to be effective competitors such as through reducing their revenue by inducing customers not to deal with them, and/or raising their costs {{such as those of}} printing. In other instances, <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> may be used to artifically raise entry costs by raising barriers to entry associated with building a credible readership base. Second, the economics of different types of conduct are assessed based on a critical evaluation of competition cases. These include, in particular, the fighting brand predatory pricing strategy, in the presence of product/customer differentiation and as applied to the economic characteristics of community newspapers, notably their two-sided nature. Third, given South Africa’s history and high levels of concentration, the dissertation considers the appropriate standards to be applied in competition law enforcement to ensure a fair environment for the participation of small businesses and those owned by historically disadvantaged individuals. It is found that the application of competition policy in assessing <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> is skewed in favour of incumbent firms, particularly in the case of predatory pricing cases, because the economics of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> are inappropriately translated into legal tests. The conclusion is that the average variable cost or marginal cost measure specified in the law and the ‘as efficient’ competitor standard applied for assessing exclusionary below-cost pricing do not afford sufficient protection for small firms and provides leeway for dominant incumbents to engage in succesful exclusionary strategies.

40|$|Issuing {{soft law}} {{instruments}} on {{the enforcement of}} abuse of a dominant position in different competition law systems {{has never been a}} global trend in the last decade than before. In the European Union (EU), the European Commission published the “Guidance on the Commission’s Enforcement Priorities in Applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to <b>Abusive</b> <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings” (the Guidance) in February 2009 as yet the final formal stage during the “modernisation” of Art. 102 TFEU. As an official candidate for EU membership, Turkey is unlikely to distance itself from the developments in the EU. Within this context, “Guidelines on the Assessment of <b>Abusive</b> <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings” (the Guidelines on Art. 6) were published on April 7, 2014. Evident from their structure and substantive content, the Guidelines on Art. 6 are closely modelled on the Guidance. Although the transposition of the Guidance into Turkish competition law seems prima facie desirable in terms of the harmonisation of Turkey’s domestic competition law with the EU acquis, the question as to whether the Guidelines on Art. 6 have suited to Turkey’s own needs gains significance. Despite being the first secondary legislation on Art. 6 of the Act on the Protection of Competition 1994 in Turkey, a lack of much-needed guidance on the problematic areas in the enforcement of Art. 6 may well result in the Guidelines on Art. 6 being a missed opportunity to establish a coherent policy on Art. 6. This thesis explores whether {{there is a need for}} adopting Guidelines in relation to Art. 6 in Turkish competition law, examines whether the Guidance can or should be used as a model, and finally gives reflections on how the legal regime and content of these Guidelines can be best tailored to the enforcement of Art. 6 in Turkey...|$|E
40|$|A single dish cannot {{serve the}} tastes of a hundred people, says an ancient Chinese proverb. So {{it is with the}} rules for {{assessing}} whether practices engaged in by firms with significant market power are anticompetitive. More than one hundred countries have competition laws and most of them have government authorities entrusted with enforcing those laws in the first instance. Yet these jurisdictions are a varied lot. Some have emerged from decades of communist rule while others have only recently privatized companies responsible for substantial parts of the economy. Their legal institutions differ, as do perhaps their tastes for dominant firms. It would be remarkable if a single dish of antitrust rules could satisfy so many. This Article establishes the proposition that divergence is the norm for antitrust rules. It argues that the quest for convergence is quixotic and the disdain when another jurisdiction has a different rule than one 2 ̆ 7 s own is uncalled for.

40|$|Unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct,</b> {{the element}} common to monopolization and {{attempted}} monopolization offenses under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, remains essentially undefined. Federal courts, including the U. S. Supreme Court, have purported {{to define the}} term, but the definitions they have offered are so indeterminate as to be, {{in the words of}} one prominent commentator, “not just vague but vacuous. ” Seeking to fill the void left by the courts, antitrust scholars have in recent years proposed four universal definitions of unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> Each, however, is deficient: One would fail to deter a substantial amount of anticompetitive conduct, and the other three would provide business planners with little guidance and no safe harbors and would likely chill efficient but novel business practices. In light of these deficiencies, some commentators have recently suggested abandoning the search for a universal definition of unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> and instead adopting non-universal standards. Such an approach, though, would either offend rule of law norms or, if implemented as some non-universalists have suggested, reduce to one of the aforementioned - and deficient - universal definitions. This Article examines the proposed definitions or tests for identifying unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> (including the non-universalist approach) and, finding each lacking, suggests an alternative definition. The proposed approach would deem conduct to be unreasonably exclusionary if it would exclude from the defendant’s market a “competitive rival,” defined as a rival that is both as determined as the defendant and capable, at minimum efficient scale, of matching the defendant’s efficiency. The “exclusion of a competitive rival” definition identifies the common thread running through instances of unreasonable exclusion, comports with widely accepted intuitions about what constitutes improper competitive conduct, and generates specific safe harbors and liability rules that collectively would maximize monopolization doctrine’s net benefits by minimizing the sum of its “decision” and “error” costs...|$|R

The profit-sacrifice test may be useful, for example, as one type of evidence of anticompetitive purpose. In unilateral refusal to deal cases, it can be useful in determining the non-exclusionary benchmark. However, the test is not generally a reliable indicator of the impact of allegedly <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> on consumer welfare - the primary focus of the antitrust laws. The profit-sacrifice test also is prone to several significant pitfalls and often would be complex and subjective to implement in practice.

40|$|In 1998, {{twenty years}} after {{publishing}} The Antitrust Paradox, Robert Bork wrote: “The antitrust case brought by the Department of Justice against Microsoft is rock solid. ” How could Robert Bork, who had labored for his whole professional life to cut antitrust down, come out in support of an aggressive monopolization suit against a leading high-technology firm, indeed, an innovating firm that had arguably generated huge benefits for those consumers whose welfare Bork thought should be antitrust’s only concern? Had Bork undergone some sort of conversion {{that led him to}} see the need to protect small competitors from the depredations of dominant firms? Or had Bork been bought? This paper explores this episode in Bork’s writing about antitrust. The paper argues that Bork was neither converted nor bought, but, rather, was applying the principles he set out in the Antitrust Paradox. The paper further argues that this episode illuminates Bork’s approach to exclusionary behavior and provides some valuable lessons on how to judge <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> The paper begins with a discussion of what Bork wrote about <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> in The Antitrust Paradox.

The Committee's recommendations are closely modelled on the framework and rationale {{of the loss of}} control defence under ss 54 – 56 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, with significant exceptions designed to circumvent the difficulties associated with the novel terminology. Interestingly, the Committee advocates the adoption of an <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> model, despite the problems associated with s. 55 (6) (c), which specifies that sexual infidelity is to be disregarded {{for the purposes of the}} concessionary mitigation. The Committee asserts that a carefully worded <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> model would serve to restrict the partial defence whilst avoiding the issues which have manifested themselves at appellate court level in England and Wales. Irrespective of the wording, specific prohibitions which focus on the conduct of the victim are unrealistic in that they fail to account for the multitudinous and interconnected nature of loss of control/provocation claims. Nevertheless, <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> models which concentrate on the conduct of the victim ought to be distinguished from clauses which focus on the defendant's actions. If the defendant undertakes to cause the victim to respond in a manner for the purpose of providing an excuse to use violence it is clear that the defence ought not to apply. Similarly, where a defendant becomes voluntarily intoxicated, it may be appropriate to exclude that intoxication from consideration when making the objective assessment as to whether an ordinary/reasonable person would have reacted as the defendant did in the circumstances. In this context, explicit legislative exclusions do have the potential to prevent unnecessary appellate litigation, but only in limited circumstances...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{antitrust}} law (in the U.

In the U.

40|$|The {{showing of}} predatory or <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> is a {{necessary}} element to prove an attempted monopolization claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act. Predatory hiring {{as a form of}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> has not been extensively analyzed from legal or economic perspectives. Most litigated cases have followed Universal Analytics, Inc. v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., where the court held that unlawful predatory hiring occurs when talent is acquired not for purposes of using that talent, but for purposes of denying it to a competitor. An anticompetitive act by a single firm is an act that is not profit maximizing but for the monopoly rents the act creates or maintains, but that is profit maximizing inclusive of those monopoly rents. However, a monopolist likely will use and derive profits from important labor talent once acquired, even if the effect of the hiring is anticompetitive. Thus, the current legal standard for proving predatory hiring as an element of an attempted monopolization claim may prevent plaintiffs from successfully prosecuting cases in which antitrust impact and injury exist. Therefore, we argue that the current legal standard required to prove a predatory-hiring claim should be revised. We use a recently litigated matter in the ambulance industry, ICare-EMS v. Rural/Metro, as a case study to make our argument. This case study is particularly revealing because, unlike most litigated matters, internal company documents and deposition testimony from plaintiff and defendant firm witnesses were not designated confidential. Therefore, we are able to illuminate the bases for the firms 2 ̆ 7 internal business decisions in great detail. These decisions reveal the companies 2 ̆ 7 intentions in ways not normally observable by antitrust scholars...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{considers}} the general definition of unlawful exclusionary practices under Section 2 of the Sherman Act as acts that: (1) are reasonably capable of creating, enlarging or prolonging monopoly power by impairing the opportunities of rivals; and (2) that either (2 a) do not benefit consumers at all, or (2 b) are unnecessary {{for the particular}} consumer benefits claimed for them, or (2 c) produce harms disproportionate to any resulting benefits. An important purpose of this progression of queries is to permit the court to avoid balancing, although balancing certainly cannot be avoided in some close cases. The given definition is very general, {{in the sense that}} it does not provide precise tests for specific practices, such as improper patent infringement suits or predatory pricing. Numerous definitions of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> have been proposed that are more focused or more technical, and some of these may be more useful for analyzing specific exclusionary practices than the very general definition offered here. However, as this paper develops, these definitions are also incomplete, in the sense that they do not account for every type of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> that the law of monopolization should condemn. Proof of actual consumer harm is generally unnecessary to the definition, but the challenged conduct must be of a type that the anticipated end result is actual consumer harm. Of course, the private plaintiff must prove the requisite actual or threatened harm to itself. Most importantly, the given definition of monopolizing conduct is flexible and frees the court of doctrinal rigidity, but it requires an extremely careful determination that the defendant has substantial market power...|$|R

40|$|A {{regulatory}} policy known as imputation has been recommended and applied {{in situations where}} a regulated firm with monopoly power over an essential input faces the threat of entry {{in one or more}} of its downstream markets. This policy generally imposes a price floor on the regulated firm's downstream output equal to the price it charges for the input plus the incremental cost of transforming a unit of that input into a unit of the final output. Such a floor is intended to prevent the regulated company from implementing predatory and/or preemptive pricing strategies against its downstream rivals. In this paper, the authors demonstrate the need for an imputation-type policy to safeguard downstream entrants from exclusionary pricing strategies by the vertically integrated incumbent. At the same time, however, the paper also illustrates several strategies available to the vertically integrated firm that can render imputation ineffective against such <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> It concludes, therefore, that imputation is unlikely to (effectively) protect new entrants that attempt to compete at the downstream stage.

This article suggests a procedural methodology for initiation and resolution of suspected collusion for determining appropriate damages. While the precise law and damages allowed will be country-specific, the general methodology should have wide application in many countries whose laws attempt to foster and preserve competition and punish and deter monopoly acquired and maintained by acting badly, such as by colluding or <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> ...|$|R
