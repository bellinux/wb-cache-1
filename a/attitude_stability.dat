It has been indicated that moment around the supporting diagonal line of quadruped in trotting gait largely influences walking stability.

The degree of influence varies with different initial stances of quadruped and we get the optimal initial stance of quadruped in trotting gait with maximal walking stability.

The sophistication of construction of the aluminum frame varies depending on the manufacturer's design. Syntactic foam is often used for the flotation material. A tooling skid may be fitted {{at the bottom of the}} system to accommodate a variety of sensors or tooling packages. By placing the light components on the top and the heavy components on the bottom, the overall system has a large separation between the center of buoyancy and the center of gravity: this provides stability and the stiffness to do work underwater. Thrusters are placed between center of buoyancy and center of gravity to maintain the <b>attitude</b> <b>stability</b> of the robot in maneuvers. Various thruster configurations and control algorithms can be used to give appropriate positional and attitude control during the operations, particularly in high current waters.

40|$|We study {{under the}} linear {{approximation}} {{the stability of}} planar motions [...] a one parameter family of partial solutions of the equations describing the satellite attitude motion in a circular orbit. Keywords: <b>attitude</b> dynamics, <b>stability</b> of motion 1. Introduction When a satellite moves in the central gravity field, its attitude motion can be a planar motion, in which case {{one of the principal}} central axes of inertia is perpendicular to the orbital plane (Beletsky, 1975). If the satellite orbit is elliptical, such planar motions have rather complicated behavior (in particular, chaotic motions are possible). The situation is simplified for a circular orbit: the equation describing the discussed class of motions represents the mathematical pendulum equation in this case. Properties of the planar satellite motions in a circular orbit were investigated previously by Kane and Shippy (1963), Markeev and Sokolsky (1977) and other specialists. 2.

40|$|This {{research}} {{draws on}} two competing {{models of the}} attitude response process to formulate and test an overall framework for <b>attitude</b> <b>stability</b> [...] i. e., the degree of correspondence between initial and delayed attitudes. According to the construction model of attitudinal response, attitudes are always constructed afresh; and are therefore susceptible to contextual influences, leading to a low degree of <b>attitude</b> <b>stability</b> across time. On the other hand, the retrieval-based model argues that a delayed attitude is formed by simply retrieving an earlier attitude, and mapping {{it on to the}} given response scale. This viewpoint dictates a high degree of stability, irrespective of the contextual cues salient at the point of delay. Our framework combines these ideas and suggests that factors that encourage a retrieval-based process at delay (e. g., high accessibility of the initial attitude) should promote <b>attitude</b> <b>stability,</b> regardless of the contextual cues available at delay. Alternatively, und [...] ...|$|E

The {{problem of}} {{development}} of the microsatellite attitude control system {{on the base of}} reaction wheels positioned along its principal central axes of inertia is considered in this article.

40|$|The {{destabilizing}} {{effect of}} the liquid on <b>attitude</b> nutation <b>stability</b> was determined from an extensive series of inorbit tests. The liquid slosh driving frequency ratio (rotor nutation frequency/rotor spin rate) was varied over the range of 0. 58 to 0. 70 for the tests by rotating the spacecraft antenna platform at different rates in inertial space. A rotor mounted accelerometer sensed the spacecraft nutation. The observed time constant for the nutation angle increase or decrease was corrected for the stabilizing contribution of the platform mounted pendulum dampers to yield the net destabilizing dedamping contribution from the liquid slosh. The in orbit tests show two unexpected maxima in the dedamping contribution at driving frequency ratios that vary with the propellant loading. The rotor nutation frequency at the maxima was {{about one-third of the}} lowest mode liquid slosh frequency given by ground test data for unspun tanks, and thus did not correspond to a simple resonance of the liquid.
