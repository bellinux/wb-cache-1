Particular attention is paid to the market for Combined Road rail Transport, both as accompanied and as non <b>accompanied</b> <b>transport.</b> These two sector are examined in an effort to detect the obstacles that are still preventing the expansion in Eastern and Central Europe of non <b>accompanied</b> <b>transport</b> techniques, now a minor phenomenon elsewhere. The analysis of the present outlook and the identification of current problems are followed by the initial steps that national governments and railway companies in these countries should make in order to upgrade transport to and from these areas. Lastly, reference is aimed to the action undertaken by national governments and transport companies of the three Western European countries having the largest share of intermodal connections with Eastern and Central Europe (Austria, Germany and Italy), particularly with reference to the Italian company CEMAT...|$|E
40|$|This work investigates an {{intermodal}} {{transportation system}} for delivering goods from a Regional Distribution Centre to supermarkets on the Isle of Wight (IOW) via {{the port of}} Southampton or Portsmouth in the UK. We consider this integrated logistics chain as a 3 -echelon transportation system. In such a system, {{there are two types}} of transport methods used to deliver goods across the Solent Channel: one is <b>accompanied</b> <b>transport,</b> which is used by most supermarkets on the IOW, such as Spar, Lidl and Co-operative food; the other is unaccompanied transport, which is used by Aldi. Five transport scenarios are studied based on different transport modes and ferry routes. The aim is to determine an optimal delivery plan for supermarkets of different business scales on IOW, in order to minimise the total running cost, fuel consumptions and carbon emissions. The problem is modelled as a vehicle routing problem with time windows and solved by genetic algorithm. The computing results suggested that <b>accompanied</b> <b>transport</b> is more cost efficient for small and medium business-scale supermarket chains on IOW, while unaccompanied transport has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of large business scale supermarket chains...|$|E

40|$|Mass {{transit railway}} {{projects}} {{are often a}} top contender to meet the rapidly increasing travel demand, especially in many Asian cities. The experience of Hong Kong, with a system of highly reputable public transport services, reveals that the viability and sustainability of mass transit railways depend very much on <b>accompanying</b> <b>transport</b> policies and land development strategies. The priority given to public transport and control on the growth of private cars, among others, have {{laid the foundation for}} success in Hong Kong over the past quarter of century. However, the recent shift in transport policy, from emphasizing an integrated public transport system to relaxing the regulations on modal competition, has resulted in an indiscriminate expansion or oversupply of bus and rail services, especially along congested or profitable corridors. Other than creating a difficult operating environment for the operators, road congestion and the burden to expand the roadway infrastructure in order to keep up with congestion are other negative externalities. It is, therefore, imperative that mass transit railway projects are planned with <b>accompanying</b> long-term <b>transport</b> policies to ensure their viability and sustainability. ...|$|R

40|$|Mass transit {{services}} improve {{mobility and}} accessibility. It is ideal if the services are financially sustainable, with affordable fares and expedient quality. The mass transit services in Hong Kong, both rail and bus, are renowned for their quality and profitability, superbly addressing the accessibility {{needs of the}} city. Hong Kong {{is also one of}} the few exceptions that all mass transit services are commercially operated. The analysis of the development of public transit services in Hong Kong over the past two decades shows evidence that the high level of accessibility on mass transit services in the territory can be attributed to several factors: land use policies that encourage the development of compact, high-density township; <b>accompanying</b> <b>transport</b> policies that grant high priority to the development of mass transit facilities; and additional government actions that ensure the financial viability of privately operated public transit services. The successful experience of Hong Kong in construction and operation of mass transit railways in accordance with commercial principles under intense market competition, especially the innovative approach of synergizing the development of transport facility and property, often serves as benchmarks for many startup rail transit projects considering participation of the private sector in order to improve their financial viability. However, the success of Hong Kong in providing financially sustainable, high-quality and affordable mass transit railway services without direct government subsidies does not mean that its model can be replicated in other metropolitan areas without similar <b>accompanying</b> <b>transport</b> and land use policies as well as comparable demographic and economic conditions. The analysis of the development of railway services in Hong Kong over the years also shows that it is often not the public private partnership model, but rather the effectiveness that the partners manage the factors influencing the accomplishment of the objectives of the rail transit project determines the success or failure of the project...|$|R
50|$|Heterogeneous nuclear RNAs (hnRNAs) {{which include}} mRNA {{precursors}} and mature mRNAs {{are associated with}} specific proteins to form heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is among the proteins that are stably associated with hnRNP complexes and along with other hnRNP proteins is likely {{to play a major}} role in the formation, packaging, processing, and function of mRNA. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is present in the nucleoplasm as part of the HNRP complex. HNRP proteins have also been identified outside of the nucleoplasm. Exchange of hnRNP for mRNA-binding proteins <b>accompanies</b> <b>transport</b> of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

40|$|Ca 2 +-ATPase of sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} is an ATP-powered Ca 2 + pump {{but also}} a H+ pump {{in the opposite direction}} with no demonstrated functional role. Here, we report a 2. 4 -Å-resolution crystal structure of the Ca 2 +-ATPase in the absence of Ca 2 + stabilized by two inhibitors, dibutyldihydroxybenzene, which bridges two transmembrane helices, and thapsigargin, also bound in the membrane region. Now visualized are water and several phospholipid molecules, one of which occupies a cleft between two transmembrane helices. Atomic models of the Ca 2 + binding sites with explicit hydrogens derived by continuum electrostatic calculations show how water and protons fill the space and compensate charge imbalance created by Ca 2 +-release. They suggest that H+ countertransport is a consequence of a requirement for maintaining structural integrity of the empty Ca 2 +-binding sites. For this reason, cation countertransport is probably mandatory for all P-type ATPases and possibly <b>accompanies</b> <b>transport</b> of water as well...|$|R

Solutions are presented to address these problems by use of smart label technologies. In particular, the paper discusses use of smart labels as an enabling technology to implement autonomous control of logistics processes. The concept of autonomous control describes decentralized decision-making in heterarchical structures. The applications of autonomous control, specified in the paper, focus on allocation of garment articles to customer orders and <b>accompanying</b> <b>transport</b> route and transport means selection problems.
