He met a young Scottish woman, Ida McClyment, gave her his card {{and talked with}} her a while before going into another carriage to smoke. There he overheard a conversation between two men, one apparently a submariner travelling to the naval base at Rosyth {{and the other a}} sailor who talked about Harwich. Lody later professed his surprise at how the two men were [...] "talking in a rather free way, considering the present times". One of the men talked about the difficulties of serving on a submarine, while the other asked Lody: [...] "What country are you? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> the other side?" [...] Lody replied, [...] "Yes, I am an American." [...] They began discussing the war and talked about the recent sinking of the cruiser HMS Pathfinder, which had become the first ship ever to be sunk by a torpedo fired by a submarine. The sailor told Lody, [...] "We are going to put out mines as the Germans have done so. We have a big surprise in store for the Germans." [...] Lody was not convinced and, after shaking hands with the sailor, left the smoking car.|$|E

Sometimes they would perform the songs on stage together. Other times Friedland would perform the songs alone, playing the piano and singing. They set up miniature revues which featured their songs. In the early 1930s, Friedland produced [...] "tabloid" [...] versions of Broadway musicals. These toured motion picture houses that showed one film feature and one live vaudeville. At the beginning of their careers, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae Clarke appeared in these vaudevilles. Friedland and Gilbert's first song issued by their own publishing firm was, <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>From</b> Heaven?. The Gilbert & Friedland Publishing Company operated for a few successful years. Its business would decline after a five-and-ten-cent store ordered five million copies of one song (Afghanistan), but reversed the deal after the song failed to catch on.|$|E
