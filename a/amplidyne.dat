40|$|Electrical Engineering is {{concerned}} with the generation, transmission, and utilisation of electric power and can be roughly sub-divided into two main sections, power engineering and radio communication engineering. The first of theses has been widely developed over the last century and at the present time is not advancing as rapidly as it was, say, twenty years ago. This could be because it is approaching its ultimate, or merely because it is being overshadowed by the more active radio and communications branch. The greatest developments in the power section at the present time are in the field of control equipment such as <b>amplidynes</b> and metadynes. In the other section the last forty years have covered the advent of radio, television, radar, and world-wide communication systems. In more recent times electronic equipment has been devised for remote and automatic control of many types of machines, both larger and small. These are {{but a few of the}} applications of electronics to lighten mans labour and enliven his leisure...|$|R
50|$|A human {{operator}} anticipates errors, {{and can also}} compensate for known lags {{in the operation of}} the system. Mimicking of this behaviour had been achieved for electronic signals and low-power electromechanical systems, but gun control was on a completely different scale, with machinery weighing tons and having significant inertia needing to move at velocities of up to 30 degrees per second, and accelerations of 10 degrees per second2. In 1937, the Admiralty had placed an order with Metropolitan Vickers for a control system for an eight-barrel Pom-Pom gun. Pestarini had developed a similar system for the Italian navy. The original design used a single Metadyne to supply a constant current to the armatures of motors mounted on several guns. Each was then controlled by manually adjusting the field current. Tustin, who did most of the design work, found that the system had a large time constant, due to the inductance of the field windings. In order to improve its response, he supplied the field windings with a constant current, and used a partially compensated Metadyne to control the armature current of each motor. Tustin compared Ward Leonard control systems, Metadynes and <b>Amplidynes,</b> and accepted that each had its merits, but favoured the Metadyne, of which he had several years experience from their use in traction control.|$|R

50|$|An <b>amplidyne</b> is an {{electromechanical}} amplifier invented prior to World War II by Ernst Alexanderson. It {{consists of an}} electric motor driving a DC generator. The signal to be amplified {{is applied to the}} generator's field winding, and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. The <b>amplidyne</b> is used in industry in high power servo and control systems, to amplify low power control signals to control powerful electric motors, for example. It is now mostly obsolete.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>amplidyne</b> {{was first}} used in the US Navy in servo systems to control the {{electric}} motors rotating naval gun mounts, to aim the gun at a target. The system (diagram right) is a feedback control system in which a feedback signal from a sensor representing the current position of the gun is compared with the control signal which represents the desired position, and the difference is amplified by the <b>amplidyne</b> generator to turn the gun mount motor. The components are: ...|$|E
50|$|An <b>amplidyne</b> is an {{electric}} motor which turns a generator on the same shaft. Unlike an ordinary motor-generator, the purpose of an <b>amplidyne</b> is not to generate a steady voltage but to generate a voltage proportional to an input current, to amplify the input. The motor provides the power, turning the generator at a constant speed, and the signal to be amplified {{is applied to the}} generator's field winding. The higher the current applied to the winding, the stronger the magnetic field and thus the higher the output voltage of the generator. So the output voltage of the generator is an amplified copy of the current waveform applied to the field winding. In a typical generator the load brushes are positioned perpendicular to the magnetic field flux. To convert a generator to an <b>amplidyne,</b> what would normally be the load brushes are connected together and the output is taken from another set of brushes that are parallel with the field. The perpendicular brushes are now called the 'quadrature' brushes. This simple change can increase the gain by a factor of 10,000 or more.|$|E

5000|$|Ernst Frederick Werner Alexanderson (January 25, 1878 [...] - [...] May 14, 1975) was a Swedish-American {{electrical}} engineer, who was {{a pioneer}} in radio and television development. He invented the Alexanderson alternator, an early radio transmitter used between 1906 and the 1930s for longwave long distance radio transmission. Alexanderson also created the <b>amplidyne,</b> a direct current amplifier used during the Second World War for controlling anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|Fire-control {{system designs}} {{developed}} during World War II used synchros extensively, to transmit angular information from guns and sights to an analog fire control computer, and to transmit the desired gun position {{back to the}} gun location. Early systems just moved indicator dials, but {{with the advent of}} the <b>amplidyne,</b> as well as motor-driven high-powered hydraulic servos, the fire control system could directly control the positions of heavy guns.|$|E
50|$|Electrical servomechanisms {{require a}} power amplifier. World War II saw the {{development}} of electrical fire-control servomechanisms, using an <b>amplidyne</b> as the power amplifier. Vacuum tube amplifiers {{were used in the}} UNISERVO tape drive for the UNIVAC I computer. The Royal Navy began experimenting with Remote Power Control (RPC) on HMS Champion in 1928 and began using RPC to control searchlights in the early 1930s. During WW2 RPC was used to control gun mounts and gun directors.|$|E
50|$|Historically, amplidynes {{were one}} of the first {{amplifiers}} to generate very high power (tens of kilowatts), allowing precise feedback control of heavy machinery. Vacuum tubes of reasonable size were unable to deliver enough power to control large motors, but vacuum tube circuits driving the input of an <b>amplidyne</b> could be used to boost small signals up to the power needed to drive large motors. Early (World War II era) gun tracking and radar systems used this approach.|$|E
5000|$|A metadyne is {{a direct}} current {{electrical}} machine with two pairs of brushes. It {{can be used as}} an amplifier or rotary transformer. It is similar to a third brush dynamo but has additional regulator or [...] "variator" [...] windings. It is also similar to an <b>amplidyne</b> except that the latter has a compensating winding which fully counteracts the effect of the flux produced by the load current. The technical description is [...] "a cross-field direct current machine designed to utilize armature reaction". A metadyne can convert a constant-voltage input into a constant-current, variable-voltage output.|$|E
50|$|Pestarini also {{visited the}} United States in 1930, {{although}} there is no record of the system being used there. The General Electric engineers, led by Ernst Alexanderson, were interested, but modified the design by the addition of a compensating winding, which counteracted the effect of the flux produced by the load current. This turned the machine from a voltage-to-current amplifier into a voltage-to-voltage amplifier, and they called the new variant an <b>Amplidyne.</b> The development costs were largely funded by US naval contracts for the development of vertical stabilisers, which were used to improve the aiming and firing of guns on ships. During the same period, the Macfarlane Engineering Company, who were based in Glasgow, developed a variant of the cross field machine quite independently, which they named the Magnicon.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{incorporated}} in 1953 as Sparkomatic Corporation. It first operated {{primarily as a}} local wholesale distributor of automobile aftermarket parts, by 1961 the company had started to sell products with their own Spark-O-Matic brand name and the product line included aftermarket car transmission shifters and related automotive accessories such as tachometers and oil gauges. In 1968 the company branched into the car audio accessories business with a line of FM car radios, speakers and related accessories. Cars in the USA were normally sold with only AM radio as standard equipment until the late 1980’s. FM radio and cassette players were optional. By the mid 1970’s the company had become better known for their car audio products and accessories, though they continued to sell other non-audio accessories {{for a short time}} longer. [...] Sparkomatic was at that time primarily a vendor of low to mid-range car audio products, with some that would be considered quite odd ball these days, like the device that converted an 8 track into a quadrophonic unit. By the latter-half of the 1970’s, they expanded into other car related accessories such as digital dashboard clocks and CB radios. A few years later they also attempted a foray into high-end car-audio, branded as <b>Amplidyne.</b> By {{the latter half of the}} 1980's, their automobile accessories where folded into a new brand called “Kenco” and by the early 90’s they had exited the market segment altogether. At the beginning of the 90’s the company entered the home audio market and created a new brand called Sennet or “Sennet Concepts” that in addition to being used on audio and home theatre speakers was also used on car audio speakers that were marketed in segment a step higher than Sparkomatic, this was ultimately not successful and thus short-lived, the company continued in the home audio business though, but using the original brand.|$|E
