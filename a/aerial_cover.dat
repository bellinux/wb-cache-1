In May, Graf was able to organise a second soccer international against a Romanian army team. For this, he called upon Herberger, now manager of the national team. Herberger arranged for several of the German squad to play, including an international debut by Fritz Walter. With Graf in goal, it was Walter who scored a hattrick in the 3–2 win.|$|E

50|$|During early 1940, Swordfish {{aircraft}} of 812 Squadron {{under the}} operational command of RAF Coastal Command commenced an aerial campaign against continental enemy-held ports along the English Channel. The aircraft were routinely sortied to deploy naval mines near such harbours; a task was most challenging {{due to the}} limitations of the aircraft and the precision navigation skill involved. To attain the range often necessary to reach some naval facilities, additional fuel tanks were installed in the crew area and the third crew member was left behind. Other RAF fighters often supported these activities, providing a degree of <b>aerial</b> <b>cover</b> where possible and occasionally conducting counterattacks upon enemy air bases.|$|E
