5|$|Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener, but made only one, and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 {{for the third}} wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell. Miller joined Morris <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E

5|$|Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia {{with only}} Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He {{was unable to}} make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, and Pollard then trapped Bradman for seven to leave Australia at 13/2. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett was beaten in flight by Young and was caught by Washbrook. Miller joined Morris <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the score to 126/3 at stumps.|$|E

After his appeal had been rejected by both the Court of Appeal and the Home Secretary, Rouse {{admitted that he had}} in fact committed the murder– although he never gave a reason– it was theorised that he had done so in an attempt to fake his own death. Despite his admission of guilt the identity of the victim has never been discovered.|$|E

5|$|Ray and Neil did not bat {{together}} in the first match, before adding 24 for the second wicket in the second innings of the following match against England. They did not bat {{together in}} the third match of the season, against New South Wales, as Ray, who was batting one position ahead of Neil, was out first in both innings. In the return match that followed, the brothers had brief partnerships of two and ten runs, Ray being dismissed soon after Neil joined him at the crease. These brief stands continued in the first innings of the match against Queensland, as Ray fell after a six-run partnership. In the second innings, the pair narrowly missed out on a century partnership. Neil came in at 1/17 to join Ray, who was opening in the match, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the score to 1/117 before Neil was out for 66. In the final match of the season against the MCC, Ray was the first wicket to fall in the innings {{and he did not}} bat with Neil.|$|E
5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, stalks of straw, fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|E
5|$|West Germany awaited in {{the final}} at Wembley, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the lead through Helmut Haller on 12 minutes; Charlton felt {{that he could have}} blocked the shot but at the time he {{believed}} that Banks had it covered, though it was Wilson who was at fault for allowing Haller the chance to shoot. England came back and took the lead, but with only a few minutes left in the game Charlton gave away a free kick after fouling Uwe Seeler whilst competing for an aerial ball; Wolfgang Weber scored the equalising goal from a goalmouth scramble created from the free kick. Geoff Hurst scored two goals in extra-time to win the game 4–2.|$|E

5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his square cut. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match against Nottinghamshire, the hosts batted first and made 179. Bradman joined Brown at 1/32 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> the score to 197 when Bradman fell for 86. The tourists reached 400 and the hosts ended at 8/299 {{in the second}} innings to hang on for a draw. Bradman rested himself for the next fixture against Hampshire, and Australia were dismissed for 117 on a drying pitch in reply to the home side's 195, {{the first time they}} had conceded a first innings lead in the tour. Australia would have been in deeper trouble but for a flurry of sixes by Miller. Hampshire were then bowled out for 103 to leave Australia a target of 182, and this time the tourists batted with much more authority to seal an eight-wicket win. The tourists had survived another tight battle under the leadership of Hassett. The final match before the First Test was against Sussex. Australia skittled the hosts for 86 before Morris and Brown put on an opening stand of 153. Bradman then joined Morris, and gave two early chances. He was dropped on two and escaped a stumping on 25. He and Morris put on 189 before the latter fell for 184. Bradman then ended his Test preparation by reaching 109, in 124 minutes with 12 fours, and declaring at 5/549, before completing another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored a defiant 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against the bumper barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his unbending resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not out for an Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made a defiant four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> a 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E

5|$|York {{were beaten}} 2–1 away by AFC Wimbledon, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> {{the lead in}} the 38th minute when Penn rebounded in Oliver's blocked shot. Rhys Murphy {{equalised}} for AFC Wimbledon on 68 minutes, before Jake Reeves scored with a 30-yard volley in the third minute of stoppage time. Platt's contract with York was terminated by mutual consent, allowing him to join Harrogate permanently. York remained seven points adrift of safety with a 2–2 draw at home to Crawley, who took the lead on five minutes through Matt Harrold before Summerfield equalised for York with a 30th-minute penalty after Alessandra was fouled by Jon Ashton in the penalty area. Liam McAlinden put Crawley back in the lead on 48 minutes, before Coulson scored York's equaliser with a curling 15-yard shot in the 69th minute. York had fallen three goals behind away to promotion-chasing Plymouth by the 42nd minute of a 3–2 defeat, who scored through Jamille Matt, Reuben Reid and a Boyle own goal. Penn brought York back into the match with a drilled shot on 52 minutes, before Summerfield scored a penalty in the 86th minute.|$|E
5|$|York's first fixture of {{the month}} was a 3–2 home defeat to AFC Wimbledon, who had not won away since mid August 2014, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>took</b> {{the lead in the}} first half with a Jake Goodman goal. During the second half De Girolamo {{equalised}} with a 15-yard shot, and AFC Wimbledon scored two goals in quick succession through Sean Rigg and Matt Tubbs, before Zubar scored for York from a few yards out to finish the scoring. Halliday made his senior debut in this match, and was named man of the match with an impressive performance at right back, before his loan was extended until 17 January 2015. Cameron Murray was loaned to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Frickley Athletic, where he made only one start during a one-month period. York went 2–0 down after 62 minutes when playing away against Bury, but fought back to draw 2–2 with Hyde scoring a header from a Coulson cross before Summerfield equalised with a 20-yard free kick. York achieved their first home win of the season by beating Accrington Stanley 1–0, meaning the club record of most home consecutive matches without a win, set at 14 in 1981–82, was not equalled. The winning goal was scored in the 35th minute by Lowe with a header from Coulson's cross. This was followed by a 3–0 away victory over Carlisle United, marking the first time York had achieved successive wins in 2014–15. Josh Carson scored shortly before half-time from Fletcher's flick on, and in the second half Summerfield scored with a curling shot from 20yards before Coulson shot into the top corner.|$|E
