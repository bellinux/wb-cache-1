5|$|On {{the voyage}} across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops {{and others on}} board the Espagne and wrote news stories <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> about the threat of torpedo attacks. In France, she {{gathered}} most of her material {{well away from the}} Western Front, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.|$|E
5|$|The {{block and}} article were controversial, {{generating}} articles on other websites <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> the broader issue of advertising ethics. Readers of Ars Technica generally followed Fisher's persuasion; {{the day after}} his article was published, 25,000 readers who used the software had allowed the display of advertisements on Ars Technica in their browser, and 200 readers had subscribed to Ars Premier.|$|E
5|$|The four {{released}} {{their debut}} full-length studio album, Something About Airplanes, on August 18, 1998. The album was favorably reviewed {{in the independent}} music scene. In 1998 the band also met their long-term manager Jordan Kurland. Kurland had heard good things <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> after a failed attempt to see them play at South By Southwest finally hooked up with them when touring with his then client, the band Crumb.|$|E
6000|$|... "And if one mustn't have 'em, {{why should}} one know <b>about</b> <b>'em</b> <b>and</b> be worried by them? If {{she comes to}} do {{mischief}}, why shouldn't she do mischief without making me an accomplice?" ...|$|R

5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to grow out of control and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) who {{practice}} limited farming. The Mikea label {{is applied to}} those who live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members of this community themselves. Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E
25|$|Two {{major feature}} films on Escobar, Escobar (2009) and Killing Pablo (2011), were {{announced}} in 2007. Details <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> additional films about Escobar, are listed below.|$|E

25|$|Muppet Magazine was {{published}} from 1983 to 1989. The magazine {{took on the}} format of being by the Muppets more than <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> had such features as celebrity interviews and comic stories.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 novel Not Comin' Home to You by Lawrence Block fictionally {{parallels}} the Starkweather and Fugate spree. Horror author Stephen King was {{strongly influenced by}} reading about the Starkweather murders {{when he was a}} youth, keeping a scrapbook <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> later creating many variations on Starkweather in his work.|$|E
25|$|Despite its {{association}} with several writers, Póvoa as a stage for literary works is rare. Notable exceptions are Luis Sepúlveda's The Worst Stories of the Grim Brothers (in Spanish, Los peores cuentos de los hermanos Grim) and António Nobre who watched Povoan fishermen at sea, sailed with them and wrote poetry <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> their way of living.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why, as to that, you know, Pinch,' {{pursued the}} other, {{stirring}} the fire again, and speaking in his rapid, off-hand way; 'it's all very right and proper to be fond of parents {{when we have}} <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> to bear <b>them</b> in remembrance after they're dead, if you have ever known anything of them. But as I never did know anything about mine personally, you know, why, I can't {{be expected to be}} very sentimental <b>about</b> <b>'em.</b> <b>And</b> I am not; that's the truth.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{reactions to}} On the Origin of Species, {{the book in}} which Charles Darwin described evolution by natural selection, included international debate, though the heat of controversy was less than that over earlier works such as Vestiges of Creation. Darwin monitored the debate closely, cheering on Thomas Henry Huxley's battles with Richard Owen to remove clerical domination of the scientific establishment. While Darwin's illness kept {{him away from the}} public debates, he read eagerly <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> mustered support through correspondence.|$|E
25|$|But {{since many}} persons are {{disturbed}} by questions concerning {{what is called}} in Latin substantia, but in Greek ousia, that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' {{there ought to be}} no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{connection}} {{to another person}} in a professional setting usually starts off with a touch, specifically a handshake. A person's handshake can speak volumes <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> their personality. Chiarella (2006) wrote an article for Esquire magazine explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ {{from person to person}} and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the verbal communication.|$|E

25|$|Sarah is {{the female}} {{half of the}} lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is {{cautious}} and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on {{what he should do}} and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay in {{the main}} Danganronpa games are split into two main styles: School Life and Class Trial. School Life follows a {{standard}} visual novel style as players explore the school grounds, converse with characters and move the story forward. During designated 'Free Time' sections, players can choose to interact with a character of their choice, learning more <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> earning new skills that can help them in the Class Trial. School Life is divided up into two sections; Daily Life, where the story simply progresses, and Deadly Life, where players must search for evidence relating to a murder.|$|E
25|$|When the lizards {{approach}} them, Nancy is fascinated but {{a little}} afraid. She remains close to Charlie. Though she does not agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E

25|$|Chipatá was {{the first}} {{settlement}} of the later New Kingdom of Granada, founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada on March 8, 1537. Shortly after, the rested and reinforced troops set foot to higher terrains towards the south. Different from the scattered and unorganised indigenous groups they encountered before, advancing into the Muisca Confederation, they found a much better organised society and economy. The agriculture of the Muisca impressed the Spanish conquistadors and made them even more curious {{to find out who}} was the leader of the civilisation. While the Muisca regarded the European conquerors with distrust, they were also curious <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> where they came from.|$|E
25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson (1932–2009) in Commerce, Oklahoma; {{they had}} four sons. In an autobiography, Mantle said he married Merlyn {{not out of}} love, but because {{he was told to}} by his domineering father. While his {{drinking}} became public knowledge during his lifetime, the press (per established practice at the time) kept quiet about his many marital infidelities. Mantle was not entirely discreet <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> when he went to his retirement ceremony in 1969, he brought his mistress along with his wife. In 1980, Mickey and Merlyn separated for 15 years, but neither filed for divorce. During this time, Mantle lived with his agent, Greer Johnson, who was not related to Mantle's wife.|$|E

60|$|A tiny stream flowed {{out of a}} dense fern-brake, {{slipped down}} a mossy-lipped stone, and ran across the path at their feet.
