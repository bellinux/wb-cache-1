Polish officials believe that this footage, as well as further documents showing cooperation of Soviets with the Gestapo during the operations, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for Russia's decision to classify most of the documents about the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a sign-in sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|E-caps {{can fail}} without any visible symptoms. Since the {{electrical}} characteristics of electrolytic capacitors <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for their use, these parameters must be tested with instruments to definitively decide if the devices have failed.

25|$|In his 1896 patent Pollak already {{recognized}} that the capacitance of the capacitor increases when roughening {{the surface of the}} anode foil. Today (2014), electrochemically etched low voltage foils can achieve an up to 200-fold increase in surface area compared to a smooth surface.

25|$|Sabburg is {{formally}} an uncapped Test player - {{his brief}} {{moment on the}} field during a Test match does not count towards official records. Cricket purists claim that players like Marnus Labuschagne or Sabburg <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why substitute fielders should not be credited for catches or appearances on the field. Therefore Sabburg is not officially recognized as an international cricketer.|$|E
25|$|The sillaginids {{are some}} of the most {{important}} commercial fishes in the Indo-Pacific region, with a few species making up the bulk of whiting catches. Their high numbers, coupled with their highly regarded flesh <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for this, and their inshore nature also has made them popular targets for recreational fishermen in a number of countries. With overfishing rife in some areas, sustainable aquaculture has allowed the commercial farming of a number of sillaginid species, as well as the use of farmed fish to restock depleted estuaries. At least one species, the Gangetic whiting, has occasionally been used in brackish water aquaria.|$|E

Most bites occur in children. In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26. 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the dog owner's property.

This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats, including bench pressing 1200 pounds (545kg) and running a mile (1.6km) in 73 seconds (49mph/78 kph, nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters). Furthermore, his enhancements <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why {{he was able to}} survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades. He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus. The secrets of creating a super-soldier were lost with the death of its creator, Dr. Abraham Erskine. In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskine's treatment, only to have them end in failure. Even worse, the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain America's 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples.|$|E

There are over 300 memorials commemorating important members of 19th century colonial society, people who served the colony generally and parishioners from the 20th century. In addition, many of the stained glass windows and items of furniture have been donated as memorials.
