5|$|In the 100m freestyle, Windle came {{second in}} his {{heat in a}} time of 54.8s, making him the sixth fastest {{qualifier}} for the semifinals. He improved his time to 54.6s in the semifinals, but this placed him only 11th and he missed the final by 0.5s. In the 200m freestyle, Windle came second in his heat behind Wenden <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> into the final by 0.3s as the seventh fastest qualifier. He improved his time by 0.1s in the final to finish sixth in 2min 0.9s. Wenden won both events. After the 200m final, Wenden lost consciousness due to exhaustion and sank underwater. Wenden was pulled from the water and saved after Windle noticed the incident.|$|E

He won his heatwhich was relatively slowin {{a time of}} 58.66s, <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> into the semifinals as the second slowest of 16 qualifiers. He then came second in his semifinal {{in a time of}} 57.89s to qualify third fastest, before again swimming slower in the final and finishing seventh in a time of 57.98s. However, the event was closely contested; only 0.18s separated third and ninth places in the semifinal and there was only 0.35s between bronze and seventh in the final.|$|E
5|$|McCool was rested for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshireon a damp pitch {{favourable}} to slower bowlingwas the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county {{for the first time}} since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long hop back to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31. However, Australia lost no further batsmen <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> home by four wickets. McCool’s leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match.|$|E

Rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> {{is believed to}} have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake <b>and</b> <b>scrape</b> became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.|$|R

5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the pace car. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.|$|E

They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement.|$|E
25|$|At the Olympics, Nakaya {{defeated}} {{his first}} two opponents by ippon, <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> through to the final by beating Tajikstan's Rasul Boqiev by yuko, and Elmont by shido. He then faced Russia's Mansur Isaev in the final. Isaev scored a yuko with a kata guruma counter, and eventually won. Many spectators and commentators were critical of Isaev's celebration, where he crawled on top of Nakaya to celebrate. Nakaya was one of Japan's only three silver medalists, and with only Kaori Matsumoto winning gold, it was the country's worst judo campaign at the Olympics.|$|E

This brought out a final caution that found one of Franchitti's closest friends off the track, Tony Kanaan winning his first Indy 500 and his first win in a few years. After climbing out of his car, Franchitti was led to the infield hospital. Franchitti was cleared uninjured; and he walked to victory lane to hug Kanaan just before the broadcasting ended.|$|E

25|$|The most {{simple way}} to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is packed into the box <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater resistance to heat.|$|E
25|$|Nagase played ippon judo in {{his first}} two fights, however {{narrowly}} won by shido against Egypt's Mohamed Abdelaal. He then faced Korea's Lee Seung-soo in the quarter-final, where he used kouchi gari to throw Lee for waza-ari, then followed up with kuzure kesa gatame for ippon. He once again met Tchrikishvili, in the semi-final, <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> through to the final with a yuko. He defeated Pietri in the final with a sankaku kami shiho for ippon, making newaza one of Nagase's most effective techniques. He became Japan's first half-middleweight world champion. He was one of Japan's three male individual gold medalists in the tournament.|$|E

Traditionally, the bark was cut <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> by men, but the making the paper itself was done by women. The process begins by washing the bark, then boiling it with ashes. It is then rinsed and beaten until the fibers knit together, then dried in the sun. Banderolas, or cut-paper banners, are hung in the streets for special occasions.|$|E

25|$|The 'ava {{beverage}} is {{made from}} the dried roots of the plant Piper methysticum and mixed with water before it is strained for drinking. The plants grow to a maximum height of about seven feet, the majority of specimens being much less. It usually has several stems springing direct from the roots. The stems and roots of the plant are of a loose character, and the roots from which the drink is made are carefully cleaned <b>and</b> <b>scraped.</b> When fully grown, the roots vary considerably in size, and, with {{a section of the}} stem of the plant attached, resemble roughly, a club. The root of the plant is called a'a 'ava, the first word meaning root. The 'ava roots are cleaned and dried in the sun before usage.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the control car.|$|E
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E

In the fourth match of the season against South Australia, she made an unbeaten 70 in a vain attempt to secure victory in the run-chase as her state were bowled out and fell to a ten-run defeat. She was then run out twice for 26 and 23 in the two matches against reigning champions Victoria, as New South Wales tied one match and lost the next by four wickets. It was two of three {{instances}} in which Blackwell was run out during the season. New South Wales had a chance for redemption in the finals against Victoria. Blackwell made a duck—her third single-digit score in as many matches—in the first final, which the titleholders won by six wickets. In the next two matches, she was unbeaten on 13 and 16 and at the crease when the winning runs were brought up. New South Wales won the second final by five wickets <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> home in the deciding match by three wickets to regain the WNCL title. Blackwell's sporadic bowling—26 overs in total—yielded one wicket at 118.00 at an economy rate of 4.37.|$|E
25|$|Hart played {{football}} for the Edmonton Eskimos from 1937 to 1939 as a centre {{and was considered}} a standout performer at the time. He coached a women's fastball team in Edmonton during the late 1930s {{as well as being}} the captain of a popular baseball team called Hart's All Stars. The players of Hart's All Stars consisted of sheet-metal workers from Edmonton. On Christmas Eve 1941 Hart was almost killed from a bicycle accident which broke both his elbows and thumbs and hurt his back severely. The injuries risked ending Hart's athletic career. The accident had happened while he was on the way to his father Edward to celebrate Christmas with the family when a fire truck drove behind him and forced Hart to swerve to the side where he was hit by another car which propelled him thirty feet foreword on the road <b>and</b> <b>scraped</b> off a large portion of his skin in the process. He spent several months at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton recovering. In the spring, still hospitalized, Hart was visited by Al Oeming, a young neighbor who had been drafted into the Canadian Navy for World War II and after being released from the hospital Hart decided to enlist. Hart enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy and was appointed the position of Director of Athletics.|$|E
