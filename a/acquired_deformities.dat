40|$|A {{systematic}} review on complications in {{all forms of}} mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) for <b>acquired</b> <b>deformities</b> was performed. Search terms expressing distraction osteogenesis were used in ‘AND’ combination with search terms comprising ‘mandible’ and terms for complication, failure, and morbidity. A search using PubMed (National Library of Medicine, NCBI), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register yielded 644 articles published between 1966 and mid October 2013. Three hundred and twenty-one eligible articles were screened in detail. Complications related to MDO in <b>acquired</b> <b>deformities</b> were reported in 105 clinical articles, involving 1332 patients. Treatments included alveolar distraction osteogenesis (ADO), mandibular lengthening, DO in bone grafts, and bi-/trifocal transport disc DO (TDDO) for segmental mandibular defects.

In young patients with an <b>acquired</b> <b>deformity</b> of the femoral head and secondary osteoarthritis, a valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy may allow better congruency but the acetabular cover may become insufficient because of subluxation of the femoral head. In patients with a spherical femoral head and acetabular dysplasia, cover can still remain insufficient after varus displacement osteotomy. We present the long-term results of intertrochanteric osteotomy combined with an acetabular shelfplasty in both these circumstances. Sixteen hips (15 patients) with a deformed femoral head, and ten (seven patients) with a spherical femoral head, underwent an intertrochanteric osteotomy and acetabular shelfplasty. The mean age {{at the time of}} surgery was 30 and 37 years and the mean final follow-up was 15 and 19 years, respectively.

40|$|Introduction To treat diseases, {{injuries}} and congenital or <b>acquired</b> <b>deformities</b> {{of the head}} and neck, maxillo-facial surgeons deal with complex surgery. For example, the correction of disfiguring facial birth defects requires the manipulation of scull bones with maximum precision. The pre-operative simulation of such procedures requires a 3 D computer model of the patient's face. We describe an approach to create such a 3 D patient model by ultra-fast holographic recording and automatic scan matching of synchronously captured holograms. The pulsed hologram records the patient's portrait within a single 2 laser shot (pulse duration appr. 35 ns). This so-called master-hologram contains the complete 3 D spatial information which, due to the extremely short recording time, is not a#ected by involuntary patient movements. In a second step, the real image of the hologram is optically reconstructed with a cw-laser. By moving a di#usor-screen through the real image, a series of 2 D images is p...|$|E
40|$|It is {{postulated}} that craniosynostosis {{is due to}} a growth abnormality in {{all or part of the}} cranial capsule. Release of the stenosed part in the first months of life will re-establish the balance between the rapidly growing brain and eye, and the cranial capsule. Three periods for operative treatment are described: early, intermediate and late. Only in the early period can operative treatment restore normal growth dynamics; in the late period the aim is correction of an established deformity. The relationship between cranial clefts and frontonasal encephaloceles is explored. If the space-occupying encephalocele is removed early, the distorted facial bones adopt a more normal position, whereas cranial clefts do not respond to early operation by remoulding.

40|$|Several surgically {{corrective}} {{procedures are}} considered to treat Adult <b>Acquired</b> Flatfoot <b>Deformity</b> (AAFD) patients, relieve pain, and restore function. Procedure selection is based on best practices and surgeon preference. Recent research created patient specific models of Adult <b>Acquired</b> Flatfoot <b>Deformity</b> (AAFD) to explore their predictive capabilities and examine effectiveness of the surgical procedure used to treat the deformity. The models’ behavior was governed solely by patient bodyweight, soft tissue constraints, and joint contact without the assumption of idealized joints. The current work expanded those models to determine if an alternate procedure {{would be more effective}} for the individual. These procedures included one hindfoot procedure, the Medializing Calcaneal Osteotomy (MCO), and one of three lateral column procedures: Evans osteotomy, Calcaneocuboid Distraction Arthrodesis (CCDA), Z osteotomy and the combination procedures MCO 2 ̆ 6 Evans osteotomy, MCO 2 ̆ 6 CCDA, and MCO 2 ̆ 6 Z osteotomy all used in combination with a tendon transfer. The combination MCO 2 ̆ 6 Evans and MCO 2 ̆ 6 Z procedures were shown to provide the greatest amount of correction for both forefoot abduction and hindfoot valgus. However, these two procedures significantly increased the joint contact force, specifically at the calcaneocuboid joint, and ground reaction force along the lateral column. With exception to the lateral bands of the plantar fascia and middle spring ligament, the strain present in the plantar fascia, spring, and deltoid ligaments decreased after all procedures. The use of patient specific computational models provided the ability to investigate effects of alternate surgical corrections on restoring biomechanical function in flatfoot patients...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to review the present approach to the surgical treatment of <b>acquired</b> flat-foot <b>deformity</b> among {{a cross section of}} academic foot and ankle surgeons in the United States. Methods: A typical case of stage II posterior tibial tendon dysfunction was developed. The hypothetical patient was a healthy 62 -year-old male with a symptomatic <b>acquired</b> flatfoot <b>deformity</b> with posterior tibial tendon dysfunction. Nonop-erative management had failed. A series of academic foot ankle surgeons were surveyed to identify their proposed operative treatment. Each surgeon surveyed was affiliated with an orthopaedic residency program and was directly responsible for teaching orthopaedic resi-dents. Each surgeon had foot and ankle patients as the major component of their practice. The overall response rate was 81 % (104 / 128). Results: Ninety-seven percent (101 / 104) of respondents reported that they would employ some type of bony procedure in their surgical treat-ment. Eighty-eight percent (89 / 104) described techniques that would preserve the subtalar and talonavicular joints. These included a medializing calcaneal osteotomy in 73 % (76 / 104), a lateral column lengthening in 41 % (43 / 104), and a medial column stabilization (first tarsometatarsal and/or navicular cuneiform arthrodesis) in 15 % (16 / 104).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{adults with}} severe {{congenital}} facial disfigurement, assessment of long-term psychological impact remains limited. This study determines the long-term psychological functioning {{in these patients}} and evaluates differences compared with patients with acquired facial disfigurement and a non-facially disfigured reference group. Also explored {{is the extent to}} which psychological functioning of the congenital group is related to satisfaction with facial appearance, fear of negative appearance evaluation by others, self-esteem, and severity of the facial deformity. METHODS: Fifty-nine adults with severe congenital facial disfigurement, 59 adults with a traumatically <b>acquired</b> facial <b>deformity</b> in adulthood, and 120 non-facially disfigured adults completed standardized psychological, physical, and demographic questionnaires, including the Fear of Negative Appearance Evaluation Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Achenbach Adult Self-Report, the 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey, and a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Adults with severe congenital facial disfigurement had relatively normal psychological functioning but appeared more prone to internalizing problems than the non-facially disfigured adults. Compared with patients with an <b>acquired</b> facial <b>deformity,</b> the congenital group displayed fewer problems on the physical component score of quality of life only. Satisfaction with facial appearance, fear of negative appearance evaluation, and self-esteem were good predictors of the different aspects of psychological functioning, with the exception of the physical component score of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Improving satisfaction with facial appearance (by surgery), enhancing self-esteem, or lowering fear of negative appearance evaluation (by psychological support) may enhance long-term psychological functioning. Future research should focus on the individual patient and risk factors for maladjustment. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons...|$|R

A cohort of 26 children with post-traumatic or post-burn contractures producing an equinus deformity was followed up for a minimum of 2  years after skeletal maturity. Cases with a bony deformity and/or nerve injury were excluded from this study. All patients were managed by a percutaneous tendo-Achilles lengthening followed by application of an Ilizarov external fixator. Post-operative treatment was in the form of gradual correction at a rate of 0. 5  mm per day. Correction started from the second postoperative day until an over-correction of 15 degrees dorsiflexion was achieved. Ankle range of movement was encouraged 4  weeks prior to removal of the external fixator. On removal of the fixator, a posterior splint was applied until substituted by an ankle foot orthoses (AFO). The AFO was used continuously during the first 2 – 3  months and at nighttime thereafter until skeletal maturity. Fifteen children were compliant {{with the use of the}} AFO until skeletal maturity and 11 non-compliant. We compared the recurrence and the size of deformity between the two groups.
