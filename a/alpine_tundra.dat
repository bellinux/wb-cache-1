5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra.</b> Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, {{particularly on the}} steep slope to the north.

Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra,</b> boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south temperate forests.

40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of vegetation zone responses {{to climate change}} was conducted using the classical Holdridge life zone model on the Loess Plateau of Northwest China. The results show that there are currently ten vegetation zones occurring on the Loess Plateau (1950 – 2000), including alvar desert, <b>alpine</b> wet <b>tundra,</b> <b>alpine</b> rain <b>tundra,</b> boreal moist forest, boreal wet forest, cool temperate desert, cool temperate desert scrub, cool temperate steppe, cool temperate moist forest, warm temperate desert scrub, warm temperate thorn steppe, and warm temperate dry forest. Seventy years later (2070 S), the alvar desert, the <b>alpine</b> wet <b>tundra</b> and the cool temperate desert will disappear, while warm temperate desert scrub and warm temperate thorn steppe will emerge. The area proportion of warm temperate dry forest will expand from 12. 2 % to 22. 8 %– 37. 2 %, while that of cool temperate moist forest will decrease from 18. 5 % to 6. 9 %– 9. 5 %. The area proportion of cool temperate steppe will decrease from 51. 8 % to 34. 5 %– 51. 6 %. Our results suggest that future climate change will be conducive to the growth and expansion of forest zones on the Loess Plateau, which can provide valuable reference information for regional vegetation restoration planning and adaptive strategies in this region...|$|R

5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra.</b> An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pass}} is open in warmer weather, it {{is a popular}} destination. A scenic {{overlook}} near the pass allows visitors {{to take in the}} <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> environment above treeline, and offers excellent views to the east of Mount Elbert, Colorado's highest peak and the second-highest mountain in the contiguous United States. Rock climbers are drawn to nearby bouldering opportunities, and informal paths lead to nearby mountain summits of even higher elevation. Backcountry skiers make use of the slopes during the late spring and early summer. Since 2011 the pass has been on the route of the USA Pro Cycling Challenge.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra,</b> the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E

25|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> {{does not}} contain trees because the climate and soils at high {{altitude}} block tree growth. <b>Alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> is distinguished from arctic tundra in that <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> typically does not have permafrost, and alpine soils are generally better drained than arctic soils. <b>Alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> transitions to subalpine forests below the tree line; stunted forests occurring at the forest-tundra ecotone (the treeline) are known as Krummholz.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> {{occurs in}} {{mountains}} worldwide. The flora of the <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> {{is characterized by}} dwarf shrubs close to the ground.

25|$|Hoodoo Mountain lies {{in an area}} of high {{elevation}} ecosystems colonizing very erodible substrate. The {{mountain is}} generally poorly forested due to its high altitude and remote alpine location. This mountainous terrain has made Hoodoo Mountain a site for <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra.</b> Even though <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> lacks trees, Hoodoo's lower flanks contain mountain hemlock. Because <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra</b> is located in various widely separated regions on Earth, there is no animal species common to all areas of <b>alpine</b> <b>tundra.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{change of}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystem spatial distribution driven by climatic change {{is one of}} important factors leading to soil erosion in Loess Plateau. The quantitative analysis of climate change impacting on vegetation ecosystem will afford the efficient data to support the implement of reasonability ecological restoration project. HLZ ecosystem model is employed to simulate the changes of climate-vegetation ecosystem in Loess Plateau during the periods from 1964 to 1974 (C 1), from 1975 to 1985 (C 2), from 1986 to 1996 (C 3), and from 1997 to 2007 (C 4) on spatial resolution of 1 km× 1 km. Combining the elevation data, {{the results show that}} there are 15 types of climate-vegetation ecosystem in which the cool temperate steppe, cool temperate moist forest and warm temperate are the major climate-vegetation types which respectively occupied the 82. 73 %, 83. 19 %, 82. 86 % during the periods from C 1 to C 4, and 79. 77 % of the sum area of Loess Plateau. The most types of moist climate-vegetation ecosystems have decreased since C 1 period, especially the area of nival area, <b>alpine</b> wet <b>tundra</b> and <b>alpine</b> rain <b>tundra</b> have rapidly decreased during the four periods. Furthermore, the average distribution elevation of all climate-vegetation ecosystems distribution are on the increase except warm temperate thorn steppe, especially the average distribution elevation of <b>alpine</b> rain <b>tundra,</b> boreal wet forest, cool temperate scrub and warm temperate dry forest have continuously increased during the four periods...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{specific}} surface area (SSA) of snow {{is needed to}} model air-snow exchange of chemical species. SSA is related to many snow physical properties, such as albedo and permeability. However, it is not described in models of snowpack evolution, {{in part because it}} is difficult to measure. Snowpack models often predict snow grain shape and snow density, and the goal {{of this paper is to}} propose parameterizations of snow SSA, based on snow density and grain shape. SSA values of 345 snow samples from snowpacks of the <b>Alpine,</b> maritime, <b>tundra</b> and taiga types are presented. Samples are regrouped into three main types: fresh (F), recent (R), and aged (A) snows, with several subtypes referring to grain shapes. Overall, there is a clear inverse correlation between SSA and density, d. Empirical equations of the form SSA = A ln(d) + B are proposed for the F and R types. For aged snows, separate correlations are proposed for subtypes A 1 (rounded grains), A 2 (faceted crystals), A 3 (depth hoar), and A 4 (lightly melted snow). Within subtypes A 1, A 2, and A 3, more elaborate classifications are made by considering the snowpack type (<b>Alpine,</b> taiga, or <b>tundra).</b> For A 1, A 2, and A 3 types, different trends are related to different intensities of wind action, which increases in the order taiga, <b>Alpine,</b> and <b>tundra.</b> We finally propose three parameterizations of snow SSA with increasing sophistication, by correlating SSA to snow type, then to snow type and density, and finally to snow type, density, and snowpack type...|$|R
