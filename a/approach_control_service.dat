50|$|Trivandrum {{airport is}} one of the major {{airports}} in south India. It plays a major role in the world aviation map, connecting and controlling about nine international air-routes and eight domestic air-routes and provides <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>service</b> to eight major and minor aerodomes. A Terminal Control Area (TMA) is established with a 250 nm lateral limit around Trivandrum airport and a vertical limit of ground to 46,000 ft. The ATC also provides approach control for arriving and departing traffic and is also an Area Control Centre for over flying aircraft and traffic operating from adjacent airports like Cochin, Calicut, Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy. Trivandrum airport is also a major training centre for ATCOs at the induction level as junior executives.The airport on average handles 350 aircraft movement per day including over flying aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Investigators then {{checked for}} another failure on Flight 3275. Further {{investigation}} {{revealed that the}} flight preparation was rapid and incomplete. This shows a lack of procedural discipline. No safety altitudes were called out by the Co-pilot in the arrival briefing. No questions were asked by the Captain. The large number of flights which the crews had made to Pristina could have created {{a certain sense of}} routine, more so in that they knew they were, as usual, going to get assistance from the ATC. They may have believed that the radar service provided by the controller was included in the <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>service</b> and that, because of this, the instructions they received ensured that they would clear any obstacles. They could not, however, have been unaware that the military radar unit only provided a limited service. This information featured in their specific instructions, though without any specifics {{on the nature of the}} limitation. The crew were also failed to check their altitude and their track. The crew also prepared an ILS approach without glide path, a procedure which is not authorised by the airline.|$|E
50|$|The Fort Sill Army Radar Approach Control ARAC is the Army's Second busiest Air Traffic Control Facility, {{providing}} Radar <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> <b>service</b> to Henry Post Army Air Field, Lawton/Fort Sill Regional Airport, Duncan/Haliburton Airport {{and many}} smaller airports in the area. In 1999 the Army announced {{its intention to}} discontinue operation of the Fort Sill ARAC at Henry Post Army Airfield in Lawton, Oklahoma. Funding {{was provided by the}} Congress within the recommended level to continue the operation of the Fort Sill ARAC until such time as a staff study to determine the most cost-effective method of continuing air traffic services is concluded. The Administrator consulted with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations on alternatives for continuing the necessary air traffic services provided by the Fort Sill ARAC before implementing any modifications to the current operations. Under the agreement, the Army will continue to operate the Fort Sill Army Radar Approach Control (ARAC) until three months after the Air Force installs a new digital radar in the Lawton-Fort Sill area, and a new advanced approach control automation system at Sheppard Air Force Base can provide full display of the data from the new Lawton-Fort Sill radar. The projected operational date is FY 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower and}} TRACON opened on September 16, 2013 with updated {{electronics}} and equipment, including the STARS radar system; improving services and safety for pilots and the flying public. With the expanded facilities and new equipment, the TRACON operates the <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> for Boise Airport, and also remotely operates the <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> for the Bozeman Airport in Montana. The TRACON was then renamed Big Sky Approach {{to reflect the}} broader geographical coverage. The consolidation of Boise and Bozeman <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> facilities into Big Sky Approach {{is part of the}} FAA's continuing plan to consolidate <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>services</b> across the nation. Boise's TRACON was designed with the option of adding additional radar scopes, and may offer <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>services</b> to other airports in the future.|$|R

50|$|The airport has no Air Traffic Control Tower. All {{aircraft}} {{are on a}} CTAF (123.0) and/or Unicom. All aircraft receive <b>approach</b> <b>control</b> <b>services</b> from the Denver Air Route Traffic Control Center. Gates and aircraft parking slots can be assigned via the airport operation radio communication channel. Jet A fuel {{is provided by the}} FBO (fixed-base operator), Galaxy Aviation. All aircraft departing runway 28 make a right or left turn to avoid the populated area of Hayden. Runway 10 has an Instrument Landing System (ILS). Snow and low ceilings during winter months cause some aircraft to divert to other airports including Denver International Airport.|$|R

40|$|Currently, cloud {{computing}} offers flexible, dynamic and cost effective computing outsourcing, but it limits these economic and operational benefits to non real-time and non safety-critical systems. This {{is because of}} the lack of alternative control, supported by current cloud infrastructures, in case of a broken cloud link. While steps have been taken in using cloud infrastructures for soft real-time systems in industrial operations, such as using a virtualised PLC from a cloud, a gap still exists in appropriate handling of operations in the case of a broken cloud link. This paper proposes a new hybrid <b>approach</b> for providing <b>control</b> <b>services</b> from the cloud that can handle the essential communication locally in case of a broken cloud link. The proposed approach is also tested with two different scenarios for an initial evaluation...|$|R

According to the U.S. Navy investigation Vincennes {{at that time}} had no equipment suitable for monitoring civil aviation frequencies, other than the International Air Distress frequency. Subsequently U.S. Navy warships in the area were equipped with dialable VHF radios, and access to flight plan information was sought, to better track commercial airliners.|$|R

50|$|Class C {{airspace}} reaches {{from the}} surface to 4,000 ft. AGL above the airport which it surrounds. Class C airspace only exists over airports which have an operational <b>control</b> tower, are <b>serviced</b> by a radar <b>approach</b> <b>control,</b> and have {{a certain number of}} instrument flight operations. Class C is also individually designed for airports but usually covers a surface area of about 5 nautical miles around the airport up to 1,200 ft AGL. At 1,200 ft. the airspace extends to 10 nautical miles in diameter which continues to 4,000 ft. Pilots are required to establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility providing air traffic <b>control</b> <b>service</b> to the area before entering the airspace. Within Class C, Visual and Instrument pilots are separated.|$|R
40|$|The FAA {{modernization}} of the nation’s {{air traffic control}} system, called the National Airspace System, or NAS, has not reduced the cost of providing air traffic <b>control</b> <b>services,</b> nor is it likely to, as currently planned. Since 1981, FAA operating costs have increased about {{as fast as the}} growth in aviation. Although its workforce took about 10 years to recover from the crippling controller strike, since 1992 it has only increased about 5 percent. The FAA predicts that in the next decade, its operating costs will continue to rise about as fast as forecast passenger-revenue miles, the principal source of Aviation Trust Fund revenues derived from ticket taxes. The aviation trust fund currently supports both FAA operations and NAS modernization appropriations. We examined more than 20 years of NAS modernization and automation program investments to modernize operations and a variety of operations and controller work force data for Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and Traffic Radar <b>Approach</b> <b>Control</b> (TRACON) facilities providing air traffic <b>control</b> <b>services.</b> At issue is why this large public agency performing an essential servic...|$|R
