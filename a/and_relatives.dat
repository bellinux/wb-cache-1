The number of subfamilies in Bovidae is disputed, with suggestions {{of as many as}} ten and as few as two subfamilies. However, molecular, morphological and fossil evidence indicates the existence of eight distinct subfamilies : Aepycerotinae (consisting of just the impala), Alcelaphinae (bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Antilopinae (several antelopes, gazelles, <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Bovinae (cattle, buffaloes, bison and other antelopes), Caprinae (goats, sheep, ibex, serows <b>and</b> <b>relatives),</b> Cephalophinae (duikers), Hippotraginae (addax, oryx <b>and</b> <b>relatives)</b> and Reduncinae (reedbuck and kob antelopes). In addition, three extinct subfamilies are known: Hypsodontinae (mid-Miocene), Oiocerinae (Turolian) and the subfamily Tethytraginae, which contains Tethytragus (mid-Miocene).|$|E

Paradoxically, the transverse Doppler shift is often used to demonstrate that for specific angles of emission and reception the relationship of proper <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> frequency of light is the same as that for proper <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> time.

40|$|This {{research}} was aimed to control thermal environment (temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity) in airconditioned rooms {{in order to}} reach thermal comfort and good health for the people in hospital. This {{research was}} divided into 2 sections: Section 1 studies the direct and indirect influence of relative humidity on the health of people inside hospital buildings <b>and</b> the appropriate <b>relative</b> humidity <b>and</b> temperature to achieve thermal comfort and good health for Thailand by using Delphi technique; Section 2 develops single phase air conditioning system using inverter to control thermal environment (temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity) inside the room to reach the appropriate temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity. The results in Section 1 showed that too high <b>and</b> too low <b>relative</b> humidity had direct and indirect effects on sick building syndrome (SBS), illness, respiratory diseases, growth and distribution of bacteria, virus, and house dust mite. The appropriate temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity for Thailand were 26 degrees Celsius and 50 - 60 %, respectively. The results in Section 2 showed that the developed system could control temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity at the desired level with the changes in temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity in the range of + 0. 35 degrees Celsius and 50 - 60 %, respectively. The development of industrial technology for single phase air-conditioner which can control temperature <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> humidity at a steady level using inverter will lead to good quality of life for the people in hospital in a sustainable manner...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} sex {{differences between the}} EEGs of Combined and Inattentive types of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD) within boys and girls aged 8 - 12 years. Subject groups included 80 AD/HD Combined type (40 boys and 40 girls), 80 AD/HD Inattentive type (40 boys and 40 girls) and 80 controls (40 boys and 40 girls). An eyes-closed resting EEG was recorded and Fourier transformed to provide estimates for absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, as well as total power and the theta/beta ratio. The boy AD/HD groups, compared with boy controls, had greater absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> theta, greater theta/beta ratio, reduced absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> alpha, <b>and</b> reduced absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> beta. The girl AD/HD groups, compared with girl controls, had greater absolute delta, greater absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> theta, greater theta/beta ratio, greater total power, <b>and</b> reduced <b>relative</b> delta <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> beta. Between AD/HD types, Combined type boys had globally greater absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> theta, greater theta/beta ratio, <b>and</b> less <b>relative</b> alpha than Inattentive type boys. While topographical differences emerged, {{there were no significant}} global differences between AD/HD types in girls. That is, EEG differences between AD/HD types are dissimilar in boys and girls. Different EEG maturational patterns between boys and girls also obscure AD/HD-related EEG abnormalities. These results have important implications for our understanding of AD/HD in girls. Ignoring such sex differences may have compromised the value of previous AD/HD investigations, and these sex differences should be recognised in future research...|$|R

This helps understand and explore why absolute <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> measures frequently evolve in opposite directions.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an efficient and robust method for performing non-rigid image registration <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> gamma estimation in a simultaneous manner. The proposed method identifies regions of interest within the target image and determines the optimal correspondence <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> gamma between each {{region of interest}} and the reference image. The problem of finding the optimal correspondence <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> gamma between each region of interest and the reference image is combined and formulated such that both problems can be solved as a single minimum squared distance problem efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The resulting correspondence <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> gamma information is used to estimate the geometric transformation between the target image and the reference image, as well as perform gamma correction between the images. Experimental results demonstrate that good registration <b>and</b> <b>relative</b> gamma estimation accuracy can be achieved using the proposed method, making it well-suited for registering images captured under different levels of exposure...|$|R

5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment of heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

However, his Protestant mother <b>and</b> <b>relatives</b> wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice.
