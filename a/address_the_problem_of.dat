5|$|Although {{the astronomical}} armillary sphere (representing the {{celestial}} sphere) existed in China since the 1st century BCE, the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 CE) provided it with motive power {{by using the}} constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted {{on a set of}} gears. Zhang Heng was also the first to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E

The work of the Croatian Mine Action Centre is supervised by the Office for Mine Action.|$|E
5|$|Barbara Bell, another scholar, {{believes}} that an economic catastrophe {{such as a}} famine or a long-lasting drought affected Egypt. To better <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> feeding the Egyptian population, Nynetjer split the realm into two and his successors founded two independent realms, perhaps with intent to reunite after the famine. Bell points to the inscriptions of the Palermo stone, where, in her opinion, {{the records of the}} annual Nile floods show constantly low levels during this period. Bell's theory is refuted today by Egyptologists such as Stephan Seidlmayer, who asserts her calculations were incorrect. Seidlmayer has shown that the annual Nile floods were at usual levels at Nynetjer's time up to the period of the Old Kingdom. Bell overlooked that the heights of the Nile floods in the Palermo stone inscription take into account the measurements of the nilometers around Memphis, but not elsewhere along the river. A state-wide drought was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars {{had shown that}} the planet appeared to move 40% faster {{on one side of}} its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset {{from the center of the}} planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
