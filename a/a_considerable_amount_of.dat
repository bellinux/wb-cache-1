40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the antioxidant activity of Coreopsis tinctoria flowering tops (CTFT). Studies were conducted to obtain suitable extraction conditions for chlorogenic acid, quercetin, luteolin, apigenin and kaempferol, which were identified and quantified by HPLC. Response surface methodology was employed to optimise the ultrasound-assisted extraction conditions including extraction time, ethanol concentration and liquid-solid ratio. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was analysed using various antioxidant models, such as DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay. CTFT extracted for 15. 0 min with ethanol at a concentration of 60. 4 % and with liquidsolid ratio 27. 5 : 1 possessed <b>a</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> total flavonoids and polyphenols (18. 9 %). This extract showed higher scavenging activity of ABTS and hydroxyl radical activity than rutin, however not in the DPPH test.

40|$|Plant sterols are {{well-known}} {{for their ability}} to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol and promote cardiovascular health, as well as anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenicity, anti-cancer and anti-oxidative activities and protection against nervous system disorders. <b>As</b> <b>considerable</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> phytosterols are present in microalgae, we screened out of hundreds of Australian isolates, ten microalgal species for sterol profiles and total sterol content. The top three sterol producers at 0. 4 - 2. 6 % dry weight were Pavlova lutheri, Tetraselmis sp. M 8 and Nannochloropsis sp. BR 2. To further increase sterol accumulation, the highest sterol producer, P. lutheri was subjected to nutrient and salinity changes. Although no significant immediate effects were observed for altered total sterol contents, individual sterols varied and, significantly higher total sterol amounts (up to a 2 -fold increase) were found after prolonged cultivation. Total sterol accumulation of 5. 1 % dry weight was achieved in P. lutheri. Combined with the high areal productivity, commercial phytosterol production from microalgae could be considered...|$|R
