50|$|<b>Azosemide</b> is a high-ceiling loop {{diuretic}} agent {{that was brought}} to market in 1981 by Boehringer Mannheim. As of 2015 it was available as a generic in some Asian countries.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLoop diuretics {{have two}} {{different}} classes with different duration of activity: short-acting such as furosemide (duration of activity, 6 h) and long-acting such as <b>azosemide</b> (duration of activity, 10 – 12 h). We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial {{in order to}} compare the therapeutic effects of <b>azosemide,</b> a long-acting loop diuretic, and furosemide, a short-acting one, on neurohumoral factors and cardiac function in outpatients with chronic heart failure (CHF). MethodsWe enrolled 98 patients with CHF who were receiving furosemide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and they were randomly divided into furosemide (n= 49) and <b>azosemide</b> (n= 49) groups. The furosemide group continued furosemide at the same dosage, and the <b>azosemide</b> group switched from furosemide to <b>azosemide.</b> At baseline and after 3 months, we measured body weight, and levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), norepinephrine, active renin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and hematocrit. Chest X-ray and echocardiography were also performed. ResultsBody weight and plasma levels of BNP and ANP significantly decreased after 3 months in the <b>azosemide</b> group compared to the furosemide group. There {{were no significant differences}} in changes of levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, potassium, hematocrit, norepinephrine, and active renin after 3 months between the furosemide and <b>azosemide</b> groups. Echocardiography and chest X-ray did not demonstrate significant differences between the two groups. ConclusionsLong-acting <b>azosemide</b> is suggested to be useful for the improvement of neurohumoral factors compared with short-acting furosemide in patients with CHF...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms of}} calcification in sea urchin larvae {{are still not}} well understood. Primary mesenchyme cells within the larval body cavity form a syncytium to secrete CaCO 3 spicules from intracellular amorphous CaCO 3 (ACC) stores. We studied the role of Na+K+ 2 Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) in intracellular ACC accumulation and larval spicule formation of Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. First, we incubated growing larvae with three different loop diuretics (<b>azosemide,</b> bumetanide, and furosemide) and established concentration-response curves. All loop diuretics were able to inhibit calcification already at concentrations that specifically inhibit NKCC. Calcification was most effectively inhibited by <b>azosemide</b> (IC 50 = 6. 5 µM), while larval mortality and swimming ability were not negatively impacted by the treatment. The inhibition by bumetanide (IC 50 = 26. 4 µM) and furosemide (IC 50 = 315. 4 µM) resembled the pharmacological fingerprint of the mammalian NKCC 1 isoform. We further examined the effect of <b>azosemide</b> on the maintenance of cytoplasmic cords and on the occurrence of calcification vesicles using fluorescent dyes (calcein, FM 1 - 43). Fifty micromolars of <b>azosemide</b> inhibited the maintenance of cytoplasmic cords and resulted in increased calcein fluorescence within calcification vesicles. The expression of NKCC in S. droebachiensis was verified by PCR and Western blot with a specific NKCC antibody. In summary, the pharmacological profile of loop diuretics and their specific effects on calcification in sea urchin larvae suggest that they act by inhibition of NKCC via repression of cytoplasmic cord formation and maintenance...|$|E
40|$|A 30 -year-old {{woman with}} pseudo-Bartter's {{syndrome}} {{was referred to}} our department because of hypokalemic symptoms caused by outrageous abuse of furosemide and by KCl infusion administered to compensate for it. As an attempt to break this vicious cycle, we first tried to change furosemide with <b>azosemide,</b> a long-lasting loop diuretics, to avoid acute excessive diuresis and excretion of potassium. Administration of losartan effectively attenuated the concentration of extremely activated plasma aldosterone. Administration of spironolactone reduced aldosterone breakthrough induced by losartan and the patient was released from both furosemide and KCl. Blocking renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system demonstrated {{to be an effective}} treatment for pseudo-Bartter's syndrome by the improvement of the total body potassium level which was decreased before treatment...|$|E
40|$|Human monocarboxylate {{transporter}} 6 (MCT 6) {{has recently}} been isolated, and its tissue distribution has been established at the mRNA level, but its functional properties remain unknown. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the transport properties of MCT 6. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, MCT 6 transported [3 H]bumetanide in a pH- and membrane potential-sensitive but not proton gradient-dependent manner, with the Kt value of 84 M. Furthermore, MCT 6 transported various drugs such as probenecid and nateglinide. Neither [14 C]L-lactic acid nor [3 H]L-tryptophan, typical substrates of other MCT isoforms, was transported by MCT 6. Four loop diuretics, i. e., furosemide, piretanide, <b>azosemide,</b> and torasemide, thiazides, probenecid, glibenclamide, and nateg-linide inhibited the MCT 6 -mediated uptake of [3 H]bumetanide. In contrast, short-chain carboxylic acids, such as L-lactic acid and succinic acid did not inhibit the MCT 6 -mediated uptake of bumet...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} frog skin acini have {{challenged}} {{the question whether}} Cl- secretion or Na+ absorption in the airways is driven by luminal K+ channels in series to a basolateral K+ conductance. We examined the possible role of luminal K+ channels in electrolyte transport in mouse trachea in Ussing-chamber experiments. Tracheas of both normal and CFTR (-/-) mice showed a dominant amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption under both, control conditions and after cAMP-dependent stimulation. The lumen-negative transepithelial voltage was enhanced after application of IBMX and forskolin and Cl- secretion was activated. Electrolyte secretion induced by IBMX and forskolin was inhibited by luminal glibenclamide and the blocker of basolateral Na(+) 2 Cl(-) K(+) cotransporter <b>azosemide.</b> Similarly, the compound 29313, a blocker of basolateral KCNQ 1 /KCNE 3 K+ channels effectively blocked Cl- secretion when applied to either the luminal or basolateral side of the epithelium. RT-PCR analysis suggested expression of additional K+ channels in tracheal epithelial cells such as Slo 1 and Kir 6. 2. However, we did not detect any functional evidence for expression of luminal K+ channels in mouse airways, using luminal 29313, clotrimazole and Ba 2 + or different K+ channel toxins such as charybdotoxin, apamin and alpha-dendrotoxin. Thus, the present study demonstrates Cl- secretion in mouse airways, which depends on basolateral Na(+) 2 Cl(-) K(+) cotransport and luminal CFTR and non-CFTR Cl- channels. Cl- secretion is maintained by the activity of basolateral K+ channels, while no clear evidence was found {{for the presence of}} a luminal K+ conductance...|$|E
