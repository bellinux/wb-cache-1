2500|$|Vernier acuity {{measures}} {{the ability to}} align two line segments. Humans can do this with remarkable accuracy. This success is sometimes regarded as hyperacuity. Under optimal conditions of good illumination, high contrast, and long line segments, the limit to vernier acuity is about 8 arc seconds or 0.13 arc minutes, compared to about 0.6 arc minutes (6/4) for normal visual acuity or the 0.4 <b>arc</b> <b>minute</b> diameter of a foveal cone. Because the limit of vernier acuity is well below that imposed on regular visual acuity by the [...] "retinal grain" [...] or size of the foveal cones, it {{is thought to be}} a process of the visual cortex rather than the retina. Supporting this idea, vernier acuity seems to correspond very closely (and may have the same underlying mechanism) enabling one to discern very slight differences in the orientations of two lines, where orientation is known to be processed in the visual cortex.|$|E
