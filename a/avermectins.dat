25|$|<b>Avermectins</b> {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. <b>Avermectins</b> act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A study was conducted with the house fly, Musca domestics (L.), to examine the pharmacokinetics of cuticular penetration of insecticides and to elucidate the mechanism of decreased uptake resistance to insecticides. The test insecticide was <b>avermectin.</b> Tritiated and nontritiated forms were used. Fly strains used were SBO, a multimutant (stubby wing, brown body, ocra eye) insecticide susceptible strain and Cyro-R, a wild type strain with low level resistance to <b>avermectin</b> associated with decreased insecticide uptake. Insecticide uptake was measured in adult flies exposed briefly to <b>avermectin</b> residues on glass surfaces. Cuticular waxes were not shown to {{play a critical role in}} insecticide uptake and quantitative differences in wax were not seen between strains. Interstrain differences were seen in the amount of loss from the cuticular surface onto holding containers following treatment, with the Cyro-R flies exhibiting 4 X more. Loss of <b>avermectin</b> from the cuticular surface was rapid, most occurring within 30 min following initial exposure. Specific binding of <b>avermectin</b> to proteins was higher in the susceptible strain, indicating the presence of a finite number of binding sites available for <b>avermectin</b> uptake. More radioactivity was present in the hemolymph of susceptible flies following brief exposure to <b>avermectin.</b> A quantitative change in the number of insecticide transport proteins was hypothesized for the differences seen between strains. To determine a natural function for an insecticide transport mechanism, flies were exposed orally to [14 C] radiolabeled glucose. Exposure was followed by measurements of [14 C] incorporation into the wax. Exposure to <b>avermectin</b> following exposure to labeled glucose reduced [14 C] buildup in the cuticle, providing evidence the same transport mechanism was involved in hydrocarbon efflux and insecticide influx. The cuticular wax does not appear to play a critical role in insecticide uptake. A saturable high affinity <b>avermectin</b> binding protein(s) appears to be responsible for transporting <b>avermectin</b> from the waxes into the hemolymph. Decreased uptake resistance may be associated with a decreased number of these transport proteins.
