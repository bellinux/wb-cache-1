A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense, as the study of plants themselves, and botany as applied science, which studies the human use of plants. Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology-classification, anatomy and physiology – that is, external form, internal structure, and functional operation. The most obvious topics in <b>applied</b> <b>botany</b> are horticulture, forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science, plant pathology, floristry, pharmacognosy, economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany. Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study. Modern molecular systematics, for example, entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy, molecular biology, computer science and more.|$|E

50|$|Paradoxically and in {{historically}} circular twist, {{the reason}} that the glass sea creatures sold to Harvard were to prove so crucial was because the University would soon, and did, open its new Botanical Museum in 1888. Given in effect a series of empty rooms and invited to make a museum for teaching botany, the first director, Professor George Lincoln Goodale, faced a familiar problem. At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study and, as such, Prof. Goodale wanted the best for his students, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled botanical specimens - a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color. Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools. In fact, Goodale's problem was essentially the same as Reichenbach's had been, but <b>applied</b> to <b>botany</b> rather than marine biology for, in both cases, the practiced method of exhibition robbed the specimens of color and three-dimensional form.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{tremendous}} increase in the use of flow cytometry (FCM) in studies on the biosystematics, ecology and population biology of vascular plants. Most studies, address questions related to spatial distribution and evolutionary significance of genome duplication (polyploidy), chromosomal variation (aneuploidy) and variation in genome size. The unsurpassed speed and reliability of estimating differences in nuclear DNA content by FCM paves the way for large-scale surveys at the landscape, population, individual and tissue levels. Another attractive feature of FCM is the possibility of reformulating former taxonomic concepts to propose robust classifications based on a detailed understanding of population structure and phenotypic variation of plant groups under investigation. In this review, special attention is paid to FCM as <b>applied</b> to <b>Botany</b> studies, and some new and less wellknown uses of it for plants will be discussed. It is likely that in the future the use of FCM in studies on taxonomy, ecology and population biology of plants will increase both in scope and frequency. Flow cytometry alone, but especially in combination with other molecular and phenotypic approaches, promises advances in our understanding of the functional significance of variation in genome size in plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} task of classifying objects by methods of morpho-colorimetric and non-parametric statistical analysis. The study can be <b>applied</b> in <b>botany</b> where manual classification of seeds is still a common practice. It is labor-intensive, subjective, and suffers from contradiction, {{as well as it}} is a time-consuming task even for highly specialized botanists. Starting from this problem, automated, consistent, and efficient algorithms of classification of seeds have been developed allowing the researcher to have a valid support for reducing drastically time for classification and, at the same time, an exploratory tool that detects latent patterns in data that human eye cannot identify. Firstly an approach called Background Subtraction, that enhances the quality of segmentation process output of an image, has been proposed. From RGB images it allows to get more precise binary images which need of a reduced intervention of manual correction. Then for each object data concern size, texture, color and shape have been extracted. These have been used as input for classification process, in which four classifiers have been performed: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification And Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). In order to enhance the classification accuracy an approach of classifier combination, indicated as CA, has been developed. It consists in spliting the complex problem of classifying among D classes into D− 1 sub problems less complex than the original one, each of them classifying between only two classes. Combining the four classifiers considered, CA allowed to reduce of 25...|$|R

50|$|Walker's {{natural history}} lectures spanned the {{academic}} year and {{were divided into two}} sections. The {{first half of the year}} he gave his 'Hippocratean' lectures, that is, meteorology, hydrology and geology. The second half of the year was devoted to the three kingdoms of nature: minerals, plants, and animals. During the 1760s, he had accepted Linnaeus' binomial classification system and during his university tenure he readily <b>applied</b> it to <b>botany.</b> However, he did not agree with Linnaeus' classification of minerals and animals and therefore he developed his own unique system for both of these subjects. As shown by Matthew Daniel Eddy, Walker developed a sophisticated theory of the earth based on evidence gathered from geochemistry and human history. Throughout his entire career he kept his ties with the Kirk and in 1790 he was elected to be Moderator, its highest position. Sometime in the late 1790s he began to lose his sight and several of his lectures were taken over by Dr Robert Jameson, a physician and former student who had also studied in mainland Europe. By the time that he died in 1803, Walker had taught well over eight hundred students, some of whom would go on to have a significant impact on nineteenth century natural history. Some of these names include Rev. Prof. John Playfair, Sir James Edward Smith, Sir James Hall, Mungo Park, Robert Waring Darwin, Robert Brown, Thomas Beddoes, Thomas Charles Hope, and Samuel Latham Mitchell.|$|R

The use of differential proteomics <b>applied</b> to <b>botany</b> and crop science {{to study the}} relevant molecular mechanisms is increasing, which explained the mechanisms of crop genetic expression and response to the environment {{at the molecular level}} (Xu et al. 2008). Kim et al. used 2 -DE technology to study the changes of expressed proteins in rice leaves at 24, 48, and 72  h after infection by Pyricularia grisea (Kim et al. 2003). Jones et al. infected Pseudomonas syringae to Arabidopsis leaves and measured the changes of proteins at 1.5 - 6  h after bacterial inoculation. This study successfully identified expression of 52 proteins changed significantly after bacterial inoculation (Jones et al. 2006). Mahmood et al. analyzed the cytoplasmic and membrane proteins from rice leaves pre-treated with Xanthomonas by 2 -DE and MS, and identified 20 proteins which was significantly changed in abundance when faced with bacterial inoculation (Mahmood et al. 2006). P. polymyxa SQR- 21 (SQR- 21) isolated by the Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab of Organic Solid Waste Utilization, China was found to be a very effective biocontrol agent (Ling et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2008). Evidence supported that some organic acids from watermelon root exudates could induce the root colonization of SQR- 21, such as malic acid and citric acid (Ling et al. 2011). The strain SQR- 21, used for the preparation of biological fertilizer could significantly reduce the population of Fusarium oxysporum in the watermelon wilt diseased soil. Both in the pot and in field experiments, SQR- 21 was showed excellent pathogen antagonistic and plant growth promotion effects. There is no information that how the watermelon root protein expression is changed after the colonized by a PGPR strain SQR- 21. In order to detect the root protein expression when colonized by SQR- 21 and evaluate the potential functions of the proteins which were differentially expressed, an adopt label free method and LC–MS technology were used to analyze the root expressed proteins during the interaction of watermelon and SQR- 21. A hydroponics split-root system was designed to verify the alterations in the expression of proteins in SQR- 21 -inoculated and un-inoculated watermelon roots. This study provides insights into the communication between plants and PGPR, which may be helpful to promote the application of SQR- 21 in the future agricultural production.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents participatory ethnographic research, {{which was}} conducted with the Aymara Indians of the northern Chilean Andes, from November 1998 through January 1999, {{in an attempt to}} understand Aymara perspectives of recent development that has taken place within their ancestral homeland. A study design was developed that would engage Aymara people directly in the assessment of their cultural and natural resources along an altitudinal gradient from the coastal city of Arica to the Altiplano, the high plateau at Lago Chungara. This interdisciplinary study in Arid Lands Resource Sciences draws upon the fields of ethnoecology, American Indian studies, <b>applied</b> cultural anthropology, <b>botany,</b> agriculture, history, physical and cultural geography, and social and environmental impact assessment. Ethnographic interviews with Aymara people were conducted in sixteen Aymara villages along an attitudinal transect from sea level to 4600 meters. A systematic social and environmental impact assessment was executed along International Chilean Highway 11, which connects Arica, Chile with the highlands of Bolivia. For Andean people, economic, spiritual and social life, are inextricably tied to land and water. The Chilean Aymara comprise a small, geographically isolated minority of Tarapaca, the northern border region, who are struggling to maintain their sustainable and traditional systems of irrigation waters distribution, agriculture and pastoralism {{in one of the most}} arid regions of the world, the Atacama Desert. Ethnoecological dimensions of the conflict between rapid economic growth and a sensitive cultural and natural resource base are explored through participatory research methods. The recent paving of Chilean Highway 11, the diversion of Altiplano waters of the Rio Lauca to the arid coast for hydroelectricity and irrigation, and Chilean national park policies regarding Aymara communities, their natural resources and cultural properties within Parque Nacional Lauca, the International Biosphere Reserve, are examined from the perspectives of the Aymara people. The potentiality of indigenous resource management of this protected area is discussed within the context of human-land reciprocal relations. The findings of this study, based on Aymara Indian perspectives, are designed to aid in understanding and appreciating the cosmological vision, and the needs of Andean communities in the poorest province of Chile. The Aymara showed great interest in having their perspectives and cultural concerns expressed and incorporated into historic and cultural preservation legislation...|$|R
