An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public talks at schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas <b>about</b> <b>health</b> and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good health to a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, and to her positive attitude towards life.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, William Sadler {{moved to}} Battle Creek, Michigan, {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where he served as a bellhop and helped in the kitchen. He also {{attended}} Battle Creek College for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings <b>about</b> <b>health</b> are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, and the idea that caffeine has negative health effects. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.|$|E

40|$|Parent-adolescent {{communication}} <b>about</b> sexual <b>health</b> is {{one strategy}} to encourage healthy adolescent sexual behaviour. However, this literature has largely overlooked immigrant families. Hmong youth, identified as facing extreme challenges to parent-adolescent communication, are considered. Content {{analysis was used}} to examine parent-adolescent communication <b>about</b> sexual <b>health</b> for forty-four pregnant or parenting Hmong adolescent girls. The minority of adolescents recalled an actual conversation <b>about</b> sexual <b>health</b> in their families with mothers most often identified as the source. Their stories reflect discussions about abstinence, puberty, pregnancy, and STIs – with much information being inaccurate. With culture being a recurrent theme, communication was reported to be hindered by cultural traditions, comfort level, applicability, and perceived consequences. The results identify opportunities for culturally-relevant sex education materials in the Hmong community.

25|$|Recent {{advances}} in psychological, medical, and physiological research {{have led to}} a new way of thinking <b>about</b> <b>health</b> and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the biopsychosocial model, views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, social support).|$|E

Research has focused primarily on cigarette tobacco smoking. In 1950, Richard Doll published research in the British Medical Journal showing a close link between smoking and lung cancer. Four years later, in 1954, the British Doctors Study, a study of some 40,000 doctors over 20 years, confirmed the suggestion, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related.|$|E

The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow waterless urinals to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run {{to the back of}} the urinals. This allows conventional water-flushing urinals to be retrofitted later, if waterless models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time.|$|E
