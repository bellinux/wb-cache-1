40|$|In {{the matter}} of port legislation, the nineties {{was a period of}} maximum {{interest}} in Spain. Two laws enacted in 1992 and 1997, respectively, aimed at increasing the autonomy of individual ports in the management and organization of its activities. Before 1992 two different models of management coexisted in the Spanish <b>port</b> system: <b>autonomous</b> decision-making <b>ports</b> and ports controlled in its decision-making by the Central Government. The question we address in this paper is how these legislative changes have affected the evolution of the levels of traffic of the Spanish port system from 1992, date of introduction of the first law, to 2003, date of approval of a third legislative change that remains out of this analysis for lack of sufficient data. We find an important impact of legislative changes on port traffic by way of an estimated econometric model over the 1966 - 2003 period. We control for the effect of other variables that might have influenced Spanish maritime traffic such as international maritime flows, taken as a proxy of globalization, or gross domestic product, under the hypothesis that maritime transport is a demand derived of economic activity. We provide evidence supporting that greater port autonomy had beneficial effects for the Spanish port system as a whole. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first port}} {{development}} in Port-au-Prince (Fort Islet) {{dates back to}} colonial times. In fact, it was backfilling a rocky reef, {{in order to provide}} {{for the establishment of a}} defense system for ships sheltered in the bay, to protect them against attack ships belonging to other powers, pirates and privateers plying the region. The first real port facilities date back to 1911. A narrow pier 610 m, flanked by a pier 183 meters long and 14.5 m wide and touching the southern flank of Fort Islet formed the basis of this early work.Various decrees to change as and when the status of the institution. That of 18 June 1973 makes it an <b>autonomous</b> body, the <b>Port</b> Authority of Port-au-Prince, able to manage other ports. Five years later, in 1978, a new name it is granted: the National Ports Authority under the supervision of the Secretary of State for Finance and Economic Affairs. The decree of March 15, 1985 gives the direction, control and operation of all ports of the Republic.|$|R
40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, Greece {{proceeded}} {{to a major}} port governance reform, aiming to overcome observed deficiencies of its national port system. Twelve major ports of national interest were transformed from 'public law undertakings' to government-owned port corporations. Responsibility of port governance was devolved to <b>autonomous</b> commercially driven <b>port</b> authorities. At a latter stage, two ports (Piraeus and Thessaloniki) were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. Grounded on the discussions regarding port performance indicators, this paper examines the financial performance of this new port governance model. It does so through an empirical evaluation of the 12 port entities' financial performance over a time span that corresponds to the sector's reorganisation. The analysis suggests that certain rigidities are still present and further steps of modernisation and restructuring are essential. Despite profitable financial results {{in the case of}} most Greek ports of national interest, the examination of the financial accounts raises considerable doubts as to the efficiency of the ports' organisational structures, currently in a transitional phase. These results are in line with suggestions that port governance in Greece does not respond, yet, to any of the potential matching framework configurations of structures and strategies that advance port competitiveness and have been identified in the port literature. ...|$|R
