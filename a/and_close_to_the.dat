5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came suddenly <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and noted a misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|In the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico, P. cyrtocristatus shared its habitat {{with other}} ornithischians and theropods. Specifically, its contemporaries were the ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum; and some {{unidentified}} fossils belonging to Tyrannosauridae, ?Ornithomimus, ?Troodontidae, ?Saurornitholestes langstoni, ?Struthiomimus, Ornithopoda, ?Chasmosaurus, ?Corythosaurus, Hadrosaurinae, Hadrosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. When Parasaurolophus existed, the Fruitland Formation was swampy, positioned in the lowlands, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{shore of the}} Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The lowermost part of the Fruitland Formation is just younger than 75.56 ± 0.41mya, with the uppermost boundary dating to 74.55 ± 0.22mya.|$|E

5|$|The beech {{forests of}} Riis Skov and Marselisborg occupy the hills {{along the coast}} {{to the north and}} south, and apart from the city centre, sandy beaches form the {{coastline}} of the entire municipality. There are two public seabaths, the northern Den Permanente below Riis Skov <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harbour area, and the southern Ballehage Beach in the Marselisborg Forests. As in most of Denmark, there are no private beaches in the municipality, but access to Den Permanente requires a membership, except in the summer.|$|E

The site had several fixed structures. The lanthanum-140 was isolated in a radiochemistry building, TA-10-1. There were four firing sites. The instruments for firing the explosives and recording the data were housed in two detonation control buildings (TA-10-13 and TA-10-15).|$|E

5|$|The mediastinal {{surface of}} the right lung is {{indented}} {{by a number of}} nearby structures. The heart sits in an impression called the cardiac impression. Above the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the lung is a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. There is a groove for the esophagus behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near {{the lower part of the}} esophageal groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{buildings}} is a terraced, three-bay, three-storey house with an adjoining four-bay, two-storey coach house, which still has its original limestone carriage arch. It {{has been used}} as a hotel since the early 19th century and was home to Anthony Trollope during his stay in Banagher in the 1840s. It has a prominent location next to the marina <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bridge. Long called The Shannon Hotel, the name was changed to The Royal Shannon in the 1990s. It has ceased to trade as a hotel and is now falling into neglect.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky says {{was influenced by}} the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> screen, to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E

5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), winds {{could have been}} as high as 150km/h (95mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more {{to the north and}} rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Beonna's coins {{are known}} from two {{separate}} hoards, {{as well as}} from a number of individual finds. Until 1968, only five of his coins were known. Several more coins came to light over the next decade, before a hoard of sceattas and other coins were discovered in 1980 at Middle Harling, north-east of Thetford <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border between the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. In all, fifty-eight coins have been excavated from Middle Harling, fourteen were found at Burrow Hill (Suffolk) and thirty-five from other places in East Anglia and elsewhere. Over a hundred 'Beonnas' are now known: most of them have been acquired by the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, <b>and</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man seated to the right {{is a pair of}} Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
