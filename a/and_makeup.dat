5|$|The show's co-creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, {{along with}} Maslany {{and her hair}} <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> artists, {{developed}} the character of Tony {{over a period of}} six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting changes <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> {{designed to}} appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than he did as Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E

5|$|Dallas Buyers Club {{garnered}} {{awards and}} nominations {{in a variety}} of categories with particular praise for the performances of actors, McConaughey and Leto. At the 86th Academy Awards, the film received six nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor for McConaughey, and Best Supporting Actor for Leto. McConaughey and Leto went on to win their respective categories—only the fifth film in Oscars history to win both awards. Hairstylist Adruitha Lee, <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> artist Robin Mathews won for Best Makeup and Hairstyling. Mathews' makeup budget for the film was only $250. At the 71st Golden Globe Awards, McConaughey won for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, and Leto won for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Muren and Industrial Light & Magic's {{visual effects}} {{department}} won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 57th Academy Awards.

The visual effects crew won the same category at the 38th British Academy Film Awards. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, Ben Burtt and other sound designers at Skywalker Sound received nominations. Spielberg, the writers, Harrison Ford, Jonathan Ke Quan, Anthony Powell <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> designer Tom Smith were nominated for their work at the Saturn Awards.

40|$|Many {{women wear}} facial makeup to {{accentuate}} their appeal <b>and</b> attractiveness. <b>Makeup</b> may vary from natural (light) to glamorous (heavy), depending {{of the context}} of interpersonal situations, an emphasis on femininity, <b>and</b> current societal <b>makeup</b> trends. This study examined how light <b>makeup</b> <b>and</b> heavy <b>makeup</b> influenced attractiveness ratings and facial recognition. In a rating task, 38 Japanese women assigned attractiveness ratings to 36 Japanese female faces with no <b>makeup,</b> light <b>makeup,</b> <b>and</b> heavy <b>makeup</b> (12 each). In a subsequent recognition task, the participants were presented with 36 old and 36 new faces. Results indicated that attractiveness was rated highest for the light <b>makeup</b> faces <b>and</b> lowest for the no makeup faces. In contrast, recognition performance was higher for the no <b>makeup</b> <b>and</b> light make up faces than for the heavy makeup faces. Faces with heavy makeup produced {{a higher rate of}} false recognition than did other faces, possibly because heavy makeup creates an impression of the style of makeup itself, rather than the individual wearing the makeup. The present study suggests that light makeup is preferable to heavy makeup in that light makeup does not interfere with individual recognition and gives beholders positive impressions...|$|R
5|$|Glam {{metal can}} be traced back to music acts like Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and Van Halen. It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, {{particularly}} on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, Skid Row, Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing <b>and</b> <b>makeup.</b> Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E

In 2007, Johansson took part in social advocacy {{as part of the}} anti-poverty campaign ONE, which was organized by U2 lead singer Bono. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's Just Not That Into You.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera, {{so that she}} could take it with her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a wig <b>and</b> <b>makeup.</b> After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E

5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig <b>and</b> <b>makeup,</b> which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography.

During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E

5|$|Vera Katz, {{also known}} as Mayor, Vera Katz, is an outdoor bronze {{sculpture}} depicting Vera Katz created by American artist Bill Bane. Unveiled in 2006, it is located along the Eastbank Esplanade in Portland, Oregon. Katz, a former mayor of the city between 1993 and 2005, supported arts and culture during her tenure and established Oregon's Percent for Art program. She was also instrumental in developing the Eastbank Esplanade, which is named after her. The sculpture has received a mostly positive reception and has inspired people to adorn it with clothing, flowers <b>and</b> <b>makeup.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{casting the}} many {{characters}} of Pride and Prejudice, the producer Sue Birtwistle and director Simon Langton {{were looking for}} actors with wit, charm and charisma, who could also play the Regency period. Their choices for the story's protagonists, 20-year-old Elizabeth Bennet and 28-year-old Mr Darcy, determined the other actors cast. Hundreds of actresses between 15 and 28 auditioned, and those with the right presence were screen-tested, performing several prepared scenes in period costumes <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> in a television studio. Straight offers were made to several established actors.|$|E
5|$|Black Swan {{swept the}} Austin Film Critics Association and Independent Spirit Awards, winning five and four awards respectively. The film also won three awards {{at both the}} New York Film Critics Awards and the Oklahoma Film Critics Awards, and {{received}} a record 12 Broadcast Film Critics Association nominations. At the latter, the film was nominated in vastly different categories, ranging from its production design, to costumes <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> to music featured in it. Black Swan performed similarly at the 64th British Academy Film Awards, again with 12 nominations, and was also nominated in similar categories. Another organization to laud the film with {{the same amount of}} nominations was the Alliance of Women Film Journalists. They recognized Black Swan in categories including Most Beautiful Film and its depiction of sexuality, but despite Arnonofsky's feature winning Best Film, it was also nominated in their Movie You Wanted To Love But Just Couldn‘t category.|$|E

5|$|Chopra {{also had}} to learn jazz dance {{for one of the}} characters. For another song {{featuring}} all twelve characters, Chopra had to shoot for 22 hours to keep the continuity of the whole musical sequence. She had to change the costumes <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> for each of the twelve characters while filming the song. At one point, Chopra fainted on the set and Gowariker wanted to postpone the filming, but she insisted on finishing the scenes. Her heavy workloadfilming for several productions, travelling for endorsements, and performing at live showstook its toll; she was admitted to hospital because of exhaustion and was kept under observation. After spending three days in hospital, she was discharged and immediately resumed filming to avoid delaying her other projects. Filming was completed by the first week of May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Fred Phillips, the {{original}} designer of Spock's Vulcan ears, served as The Motion Pictures makeup artist. He {{and his staff}} were responsible for fifty masks <b>and</b> <b>makeup</b> for the aliens seen in the film. The designs were developed by Phillips himself or else off Fletcher's sketches. In his long association with Star Trek Phillips produced his 2000th Spock ear during production of The Motion Picture. Each ear was made of latex and other ingredients blended together in a kitchen mixer, then baked for six hours. Though Phillips had saved {{the original}} television series casts used for making the appliances, Nimoy's ears had grown in the decade since and new molds had to be fabricated. While {{on the small screen}} the ears could be used up to four times, since nicks and tears did not show up on television, Phillips had to create around three pairs a day for Nimoy during filming. The upswept Vulcan eyebrows needed to be applied hair by hair for proper detail, and it took Nimoy more than two hours to prepare for filming—twice as long as it had for television.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair <b>and</b> <b>makeup.</b> By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} makeup on {{attractiveness}} {{have been evaluated}} using mainly subjective measures. In this study, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from a total of 45 Japanese women (n = 23 and n = 22 for Experiment 1 and 2, respectively) to examine the neural processing of faces with no <b>makeup,</b> light <b>makeup,</b> <b>and</b> heavy <b>makeup.</b> To have the participants look at each face carefully, an identity judgement task was used: {{they were asked to}} judge whether the two faces presented in succession were of the same person or not. The ERP waveforms in response to the first faces were analyzed. In two experiments with different stimulus probabilities, the amplitudes of N 170 and vertex positive potential (VPP) were smaller for faces with light makeup than for faces with heavy makeup or no makeup. The P 1 amplitude did not differ between facial types. In a subsequent rating phase, faces with light makeup were rated as more attractive than faces with heavy <b>makeup</b> <b>and</b> no <b>makeup.</b> The results suggest that the processing fluency of faces with light makeup {{is one of the reasons}} why light makeup is preferred to heavy <b>makeup</b> <b>and</b> no <b>makeup</b> in daily life...|$|R
