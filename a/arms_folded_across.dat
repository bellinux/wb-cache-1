5|$|The nesting Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} {{was placed}} on top of what was probably a ring of eggs, with its <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> them. None of the eggs are complete, but they are estimated to have been 5to 6cm (2to 2.3in) wide and 14to 16cm (5to 6in) long when intact. The specimen {{was found in a}} stratigraphic area that indicates Nemegtomaia preferred nesting near streams that would provide soft, sandy substrate and food. Nemegtomaia may have protected its eggs by covering them with its tail and wing feathers. The skeleton of the nesting specimen has damage that indicates it was scavenged by skin beetles. The diet of oviraptorids is uncertain, but their skulls are most similar to other animals that are known or thought to have been herbivorous. Nemegtomaia is known from the Nemegt and Baruungoyot Formations, which are thought to represent humid and arid environments that coexisted in the same area.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{standing}} {{image is}} the focus of much discussion among historians and archaeologists, since there is a general belief {{that it is not a}} statue of the Buddha. The image is [...] tall, and stands on a low pedestal shaped like a lotus. It leans back in a relaxed manner, its <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> its chest. [...] The statue's face carries a sorrowful expression and the reclining image—which depicts the Buddha's parinirvana—lies next to it, which has led some to believe that it is the monk Ānanda, who is lamenting the Buddha's demise at his deathbed. [...] The remains of the walls, however, indicate that the two images were once in separate chambers, rather than next to each other. Paranavithana believes that the statue is of the Buddha, which depicts the para dukkha dukkhitha mudra or [...] "sorrow for the sorrow of others". However, this is a rarely used gesture in Sinhalese sculpture, and is seen at only a few locations in the country. Another possibility is that the image shows the Buddha during his second week after enlightenment, which he spent gazing at the Bodhi Tree in gratitude for providing him shelter. The image is not mentioned in the Chulavamsa, which only mentions the other three. While this may be an indication that it is not an image of the Buddha, it is also possible that it may have been made at an earlier period than the others.|$|E
50|$|The {{manner in}} which a person <b>folds</b> <b>arms</b> is one of the clearest dynamic {{morphological}} characteristics by which each person can be assigned to one of two alternative phenotypes. Interestingly, once adopted manner of <b>arms</b> <b>folding</b> <b>across</b> the chest does not change throughout the lifetime and persons easily give up the unusual folding position, most commonly at the first attempt. It has been shown that the phenotypes of these properties are distributed independently with left-handed and right-handed people.|$|R
6000|$|But on {{the same}} afternoon, just about that hour, Noel {{was sitting on the}} river-bank with her <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> tight <b>across</b> her chest, and by her side Cyril Morland, with despair in his face, was {{twisting}} a telegram [...] "Rejoin tonight. Regiment leaves to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{the lots}} were all drawn, and one man, {{apparently}} a young pirate, stepped out from among his fellows. His head was bowed, and his <b>arms</b> were <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his manly chest. The captain spoke a few words, {{and the young}} pirate advanced alone {{to the side of}} the deep hole.|$|R
500|$|The Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{was found}} {{associated with a}} nest with eggs; its feet {{were placed in the}} centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the tops of the eggs {{on each side of the}} body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90cm (35in) wide and 100cm (30in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25cm (10in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20cm (8in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5mm (0.2in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of it shows that the nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, sandstorms, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.|$|E
2500|$|Bronze Age Cycladic art, {{to about}} 1100 BC, had already shown an unusual {{focus on the}} human figure, usually shown in a {{straightforward}} frontal standing position with <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the stomach. [...] Among the smaller features only noses, sometimes eyes, and female breasts were carved, though the figures were apparently usually painted and may have originally looked very different.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} dark now, for {{a bank of}} clouds hid {{the glory of the}} evening sky, and he could see only the mere outline of the woman whom he so passionately loved, the small head with the {{fluttering}} curls fanned by the wind, the graceful shoulders and <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> primly <b>across</b> her bosom.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{a little}} breath between her teeth, {{but she was}} as good as her word. She refused all food and sat with her <b>arms</b> <b>folded,</b> glaring <b>across</b> at Mr. Bundercombe's table. My admiration for that man of genius was never greater than on that day. So far from hurrying over his luncheon, he seemed {{inclined}} to prolong it.|$|R
60|$|Other {{well-known}} {{faces are}} there also, dimly {{outlined in the}} fast-gathering gloom. But everyone notes Citizen-Deputy Déroulède, the idol of the people, as {{he sits on the}} extreme end of a bench on the right, with <b>arms</b> tightly <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his chest, the light from the hanging lamp falling straight on his dark head and proud, straight brows, with the large, restless, eager eyes.|$|R
60|$|Thuvia glanced quickly toward Carthoris. He was {{standing}} erect, with high-held head and <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his broad chest. A haughty smile curved his lips.|$|E

60|$|After {{which there}} was silence between the two men. Beresteyn walked more rapidly along, his fur-lined cloak wrapped closely round him, his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> tightly <b>across</b> his chest and his hands clenched {{underneath}} his cloak. Stoutenburg {{on the other hand}} was also willing to let the matter drop and to allow the subtle poison which he had instilled into his friend's mind to ferment and bring forth such thoughts as would suit his own plans.|$|R
60|$|In the vague, {{dim light}} of the moon Yvonne could just {{distinguish}} the two men as they stood confronting one another. Martin-Roget, tall, massive, with <b>arms</b> now <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his breast, shrugging his broad shoulders at the duc's impassioned query--and her father who suddenly appeared to have shrunk within himself, who raised one trembling hand to his forehead and with the other sought with pathetic entreaty the support of his daughter's arm.|$|R
5000|$|The bronze bust {{rests on}} a three-part {{limestone}} base. The sculpture depicts Owen {{from the waist up}} wearing a Union military uniform with a cape-like overcoat. Owen's <b>arms</b> are <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his chest and he gazes down to the proper right. The bottom, proper left side of the bust has an inscription that reads, [...] "Belle Kinney/NY". The upper base has a wave motif carved into a border. The center base contains an inscription written with affixed bronze letters: ...|$|R

60|$|An old-looking man spoke. He {{lay with}} his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his breast, {{addressing}} apparently the smoky rafters. He was a Russian, {{a teacher of}} languages in Paris at {{the outbreak of the}} war, and had joined the French Army.|$|E
60|$|Paul started. He {{had been}} standing, {{like a man}} in a dream, with <b>folded</b> <b>arms,</b> looking <b>across</b> the room with idle eyes, and unconsciously {{ignoring}} many salutations. His brother's tone sounded oddly in his ears, and he looked flushed and a little nervous.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{a slight}} noise {{brought him to}} his feet. For an instant it seemed to his dazed senses {{that one of the}} {{pictures}} opposite had walked from its frame. There, beside the table, and almost within arm's length of him, was standing a huge man, silent, motionless, with no sign of life save his fierce-glinting eyes. He was black-haired, olive-skinned, with a pointed tuft of black beard, and a great, fierce nose, towards which all his features seemed to run. His cheeks were wrinkled like a last year's apple, but his sweep of shoulder, and bony, corded hands, told of a strength which was unsapped by age. His <b>arms</b> were <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his arching chest, and his mouth was set in a fixed smile.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes Christian crept in unnoticed, and sat watching, {{with her}} <b>arms</b> tightly <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> her breast. At night, after Greta was asleep, she would toss {{from side to}} side, muttering feverish prayers. She spent hours at her little table in the schoolroom, writing letters to Harz that were never sent. Once she wrote these words: [...] "I am the most wicked of all creatures--I have even wished that he may die!" [...] A few minutes {{afterwards}} Miss Naylor found her with her head buried on her arms. Christian sprang up; tears were streaming down her cheeks. [...] "Don't touch me!" [...] she cried, and rushed away. Later, she stole into her uncle's room, and sank {{down on the floor}} beside the bed. She sat there silently, unnoticed all the evening. When night came she could hardly be persuaded to leave the room.|$|R
60|$|And {{he pointed}} both to Segrave and to Endicott, The former, after his mad {{outburst}} of ungovernable rage, had regained a certain measure of calm. He stood, facing Lambert, with <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his chest, whilst {{a smile of}} insulting irony curled his thin lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would he mind if I {{woke him}} up? I want {{very much to}} talk to him." [...] Harris peered inside. He could see a neat room, with a desk, a rug and lamp, and two bunks. On one of the bunks was Westerburg, lying face up, his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his chest, his eyes tightly closed.|$|E
60|$|Armand {{had said}} nothing during this time. While Blakeney was {{unfolding}} {{his plan for}} him and for Lord Hastings--a plan which practically was a command--he had sat with his <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his chest, his head sunk upon his breast. When Blakeney had asked if they were satisfied, he had taken no part in Hastings' protest nor responded to his leader's good-humoured banter.|$|E
50|$|The {{sleeves of}} the jacket are {{typically}} sewn shut at the ends—a significant restraint in itself because it restrains {{the use of}} the hands. The <b>arms</b> are then <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> the front, with the ends of the sleeves wrapping around to fasten or tie behind the back. On some jackets, the sleeve-ends are anchored to the garment to allow the fastening or knot to rotate away from the wearer's hands as they move their arms, making it more difficult to undo. Some straitjackets are designed to have the person's arms crossed behind him/her rather than in front to ensure restraint even more.|$|R
60|$|Ann Veronica did, {{and also}} {{assisted}} nimbly with the arrangements of {{the rows of}} eight with which the struggle began. Then she sat watching the play, sometimes offering a helpful suggestion, sometimes letting her attention wander to the smoothly shining <b>arms</b> she had <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> her knees just below {{the edge of the}} table. She was feeling extraordinarily well that night, so that the sense of her body was a deep delight, a realization of a gentle warmth and strength and elastic firmness. Then she glanced at the cards again, over which her aunt's many-ringed hand played, and then at the rather weak, rather plump face that surveyed its operations.|$|R
6000|$|Rick Voisey was a rackety, hunting fellow, and [...] "dipped" [...] the old farm {{up to its}} {{thatched}} roof. John Ford {{took his}} revenge by buying up the mortgages, foreclosing, and commanding his daughter and Voisey {{to go on living}} here rent free; this they dutifully did until they were both killed in a dog-cart accident, eight years ago. Old Ford's financial smash came a year later, and since then he's lived here with Pasiance. I fancy it's the cross in her blood that makes her so restless, and irresponsible: if she had been all a native she'd have been happy enough here, or all a stranger like John Ford himself, but the two strains struggling for mastery seem to give her no rest. You'll think this a far-fetched theory, but I believe it to be the true one. She'll stand with lips pressed together, her <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> tight <b>across</b> her narrow chest, staring as if she could see beyond the things round her; then something catches her attention, her eyes will grow laughing, soft, or scornful all in a minute! She's eighteen, perfectly fearless in a boat, but you can't get her to mount a horse--a sore subject with her grandfather, who spends most of his day on a lean, half-bred pony, that carries him like a feather, for all his weight.|$|R
60|$|Diogenes with {{elaborate}} courtesy threw the inner door open, and stood beside it plumed hat in hand while the mevrouw sailed past him, with <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> her ample bosom, {{and one of}} those dignified glances in her round eyes that should have annihilated this impious malapert, whose face--despite its airs of deference, was wreathed in an obviously ironical smile.|$|E
60|$|Silas {{stood with}} <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> his broad chest. As {{he gazed at}} his sister great tears coursed down his dark cheeks and splashed on the hands which so tenderly clasped his own. Betty stood before him transformed; all signs of weariness had vanished; her eyes shone with a fateful resolve; her white and eager face was surpassingly {{beautiful}} with its light of hope, of prayer, of heroism.|$|E
60|$|I looked up, {{attracted}} by {{the tone of the}} man's voice, to see a single, straight, slim figure standing erect {{in the center of the}} line of prostrate girls, her <b>arms</b> <b>folded</b> <b>across</b> her breast and little chin in the air. Her back was toward me--I could not see her face, though I should like to see the countenance of this savage young lioness, standing there defiant among that herd of terrified sheep.|$|E
