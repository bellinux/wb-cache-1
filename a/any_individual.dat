5|$|The {{two-fold}} cost of sex {{was first}} described by John Maynard Smith. The first cost {{is that in}} sexually dimorphic species {{only one of the}} two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates.) The second cost is that <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. <b>Any</b> <b>individual</b> rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|Brooks was {{the first}} and the longest-serving of the British war photographers, and took more than 4,400 images. This was the most of <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> photographer, and {{represented}} more than 10% of all the official photographs. A large collection of his photographs is now held by the Imperial War Museum, and a second collection is held by the National Library of Scotland as part of Earl Haig's papers; both have been digitised.|$|E

5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Team GB entered nine gymnasts {{into the}} artistic and {{trampoline}} events. Louis Smith, {{in winning the}} bronze medal in the men's pommel horse, became the first ever British gymnast to win an individual apparatus medal in gymnastics, and the first Briton to win <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> gymnastics medal since Walter Tysall won men's all-around medal in 1908.

Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the show {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, with some calling it the best show on television.

5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first Arrogant and then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E

5|$|Each republican {{magistrate}} held certain constitutional powers. Only the People of Rome (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer these powers on <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> magistrate. The most powerful constitutional power was imperium. Imperium was held by both consuls and praetors. Imperium gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. All magistrates also had the power of coercion. This was used by magistrates to maintain public order. While in Rome, all citizens could seek judgment against coercion. This protection was called provocatio (see below). Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power would often be used to obstruct political opponents.|$|E

These 17 nominations broke {{the record for the}} most nominations for a comedy series, meaning that 30 Rock was the most-nominated comedy series for <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> Primetime Emmy Award year. The previous holder of this record was The Larry Sanders Show in 1996 with 16 nominations. 30 Rock also won the Television Critics Association Award for Outstanding Achievement in Comedy.|$|E
5|$|In Scotland, the Saltire can {{be flown}} {{at any time}} by <b>any</b> <b>individual,</b> company, local authority, {{hospital}} or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings, however in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council's coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.|$|E

5|$|In short, an Indian cannot today gain a {{right of}} {{occupancy}} simply by occupying public land, as the Indians did in Cramer. Under current law, that occupancy could {{not be viewed as}} undertaken with the implied consent of the government, as was the occupancy in Cramer. We therefore conclude that <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> occupancy rights acquired by the Danns must have had their inception prior to November 26, 1934, the date that the lands in question were withdrawn from entry by Executive Order No. 6910.|$|E
5|$|New York County is the United States' second-smallest county by {{land area}} (larger only than Kalawao County, Hawaii), {{and is also}} the most densely {{populated}} U.S. county. It {{is also one of the}} most densely populated areas in the world, with a census-estimated 2016 population of 1,643,734 living in a land area of , or 71,999 residents per square mile (27,799/km2), higher than the density of <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> U.S. city. On business days, the influx of commuters increases this number to over 3.9 million, or more than 170,000 people per square mile (65,600/km2). Manhattan has the third-largest population of New York City's five boroughs, after Brooklyn and Queens, and is the smallest borough in terms of land area.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires {{any member of the}} order to return to the chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down as family heirlooms, or loaned or donated for display in museums, they cannot be sold by <b>any</b> <b>individual</b> other than the monarch with the proper advice and consent of her ministers. Over the decades, however, a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale, the first being the Companion's badge of Major Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.|$|E
