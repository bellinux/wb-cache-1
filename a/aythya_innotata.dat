50|$|The lake {{is also an}} {{important}} but increasingly threatened habitat for waterbirds, including the endangered Meller's duck (Anas melleri). Two waterbird species were endemic to northern Madagascar, the Madagascar pochard (<b>Aythya</b> <b>innotata)</b> and the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus). The Madagascar pochard is now critically endangered and no longer found on the lake, although very small numbers exist elsewhere. The Alaotra grebe was declared extinct in 2010. In earlier times, Lake Alaotra was where the largest numbers lived, the near-flightless grebe may never have occurred elsewhere except in the immediate area of the lake.|$|E
40|$|Ten wildfowl taxa are {{resident}} in Madagascar including four endemics: Madagascar White-backed Duck Thalassornis leuconotus insularis, Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri, Meller’s Duck A. melleri and Madagascar Pochard <b>Aythya</b> <b>innotata.</b> These endemic duck taxa were amongst the last wildfowl forms {{to be described}} in Africa and are undoubtedly currently the rarest in this region. The history of our knowledge of these birds follows four easily definable stages: discovery, understanding, protection and the future. The new millennium has started with a much more detailed understanding of the four ducks ’ ecology than ever before, the protection of several key sites and the re-discovery in 2006 of the Madagascar Pochard. The next few years will tell if the ducks have a more secure future and, while not yet safe, Madagascar’s ducks are perhaps now among the better known of Africa’s endemic wildfowl. Key words: endemic, Madagascar, protection, status review, wildfowl. Madagascar has ten extant species of wildfowl (Anatidae) with a further two species (of sheldgeese) Centrornis majori and Alopochen sirabensis known only from sub-fossil remains (Table 1) (Young et al. 2003; Young & Kear 2006). The extant taxa include three full endemic species and an endemic subspecies with varied geographical origins: two species – Madagascar Teal Anas bernieri and Madagascar Pochard <b>Aythya</b> <b>innotata</b> – are of Australo/Asian origins, and two others...|$|E
