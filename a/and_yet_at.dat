500|$|Meyerbeer's {{relationship}} with Heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness {{of the social}} personae of both parties. Meyerbeer, apart from any of his personal feelings, needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music. He genuinely admired Heine's verse, and {{made a number of}} settings from it. Heine, living in Paris from 1830, always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity, and always short of money, asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself. He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him (and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine's widow to suppress such writings). <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>at</b> Heine's death in 1856, Meyerbeer wrote in his diary 'Peace be to his ashes. I forgive him from my heart for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.' ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{original}} LP's third disc, entitled Apple Jam, {{four of the}} five tracks – [...] "Out of the Blue", [...] "Plug Me In", [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] – are improvised instrumentals built around minimal chord changes, {{or in the case of}} [...] "Out of the Blue", a single-chord riff. The title for [...] "I Remember Jeep" [...] originated from the name of Clapton's dog, Jeep, and [...] "Thanks for the Pepperoni" [...] came from a line on a Lenny Bruce comedy album. In a December 2000 interview with Billboard magazine, Harrison explained: [...] "For the jams, I didn't want to just throw [...] in the cupboard, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> the same time it wasn't part of the record; that's why I put it on a separate label to go in the package as a kind of bonus." ...|$|E

500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> the end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that certainly is a relevant topic today." ...|$|E

2500|$|The canal {{continued}} to be strategically important after the Second World War as a conduit for the shipment of oil. Petroleum business historian Daniel Yergin wrote of the period: [...] "In 1948, the canal abruptly lost its traditional rationale. ... control over the canal {{could no longer be}} preserved on grounds that it was critical to the defence either of India or of an empire that was being liquidated. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>at</b> exactly the same moment, the canal was gaining a new role—as the highway not of empire, but of oil. ... By 1955, petroleum accounted for half of the canal's traffic, and, in turn, two thirds of Europe's oil passed through it".|$|E
2500|$|Director Jesper W. Nielsen {{said the}} series is [...] "About how one woman's search for a lost child opens Pandora's box; {{revealing}} the terrible lies and secrets in the little village of Redwater" [...] and [...] "about how the strong bonds of love in a family can hold everything together, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>at</b> the same time—destroy everything. It has echoes of a Shakespearean drama, told in a rich cinematic style, loaded with humour and suspense." [...] Editor Celia Haining said that Kat and Alfie [...] "end up becoming entangled with four generations of an Irish family who all have their own mysterious secrets about the past". Richie confirmed that Alfie's brain tumour {{would be part of}} the story, and that Kat and Alfie's storylines are [...] "part of a large tapestry of other stories that are happening in Redwater." [...] Ian McElhinney, who plays Lance Byrne in the series, described the village of Redwater as a [...] "small community" [...] that is dominated by the Byrne family, who are connected to everyone else. The series also revolves around a family tragedy that happened 21 years previously. Fionnula Flanagan, who plays Agnes Byrne in the series, confirmed that it is about [...] "the suppressed whisperings and shoulder nudges that were for decades a feature of Irish rural life".|$|E
