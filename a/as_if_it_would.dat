5|$|Sometime after Lochry's Defeat, Brant and Simon Girty {{got into}} an altercation along the Ohio River. According to {{contemporary}} gossip, Girty took exception to Brant's boasting about {{the success of the}} expedition, perhaps because Girty believed his brother George deserved more credit. The two men, who were reportedly drunk, came to blows, which ended when Brant slashed Girty in the head with his sword. The wound, which took several months to heal, left a scar on Girty's forehead. When Brant returned to Detroit in October, he had a sword cut on his leg, which had become infected and initially looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> result in amputation. The wound was officially reported as accidentally self-inflicted, although gossipers said that it {{was the result of the}} fight with Girty. Brant's Iroquois companions returned home, but Brant was compelled to stay in Detroit over the winter in order to recover.|$|E
5|$|The 1943 Alabama Crimson Tide {{football}} team was {{to represent the}} University of Alabama in the 1943 college football season; however, the season was canceled due {{to the effects of}} World War II. In February 1943, the Army instituted a policy that prohibited their cadets from participation in intercollegiate athletics. Unsure if a season would occur, head coach Frank Thomas proceeded through spring practice <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be played. By summer, only two Alabama players were available to compete on the squad {{as a result of the}} Army prohibition on its trainees competing in intercollegiate athletics, and on August 23, 1943, the University announced its decision to cancel the 1943 season. The cancellation marked only the third time since the inaugural 1892 season that Alabama did not field a {{football team}}.|$|E
5|$|With Ortona and Villa Grande captured, {{it looked}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> require the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more {{concentrated}} blow at Orsogna {{to complete the}} breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. Drifting snow, sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. Montgomery—realising the Eighth Army {{no longer had the}} strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome—recommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted. Alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.|$|E

25|$|Game 5, for {{the longest}} time, looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be the series {{clinching}} win for the Rays. B.J. Upton hit a 2-run {{home run in the}} 1st inning to make it 2–0. Carlos Peña would hit one of his own in the 3rd inning, immediately followed by a home run by Evan Longoria, giving the Rays a 5–0 lead. Upton would double in the 7th inning, scoring two more runs, increasing the lead to 7–0. In {{the bottom half of the}} 7th inning, with Rays starter Scott Kazmir having been removed from the game by manager Joe Maddon, the Red Sox would begin to rally. Boston would score four runs in that inning by virtue of a Dustin Pedroia RBI single, and a 3-run home run by David Ortiz which cut the Rays' lead to 7–4. With the Rays' bats quiet in the 8th inning, J. D. Drew hit a 2-run home run to bring the Red Sox within one run, and Coco Crisp would single home the tying run to make the score even at 7–7. In the 9th inning, with the score still tied and two out, Kevin Youkilis hit a ground ball to Rays third baseman Evan Longoria who made an errant throw which allowed Youkilis to advance to 2nd Base. After an intentional walk issued by the Rays, J. D. Drew came up big for Boston once again, sailing a fly ball over the head of Right Fielder Gabe Gross which fell to the ground and then bounced over the Right Field wall, scoring Youkilis on the ground rule double and capping off the largest comeback by a team facing elimination in postseason history. The Rays series lead was now down to only one game heading into Game 6, but would now return home as the series shifted back to Tropicana Field.|$|E
2500|$|In 1909, Walter Travis, {{editor of}} The American Golfer magazine, {{described}} Maxwell as [...] "... a big, tall, powerful man with massive proportions {{and a fine}} pair of legs under him. His style is rather forceful, and perhaps, as some would say, a trifle clumsy. He hits hard, but unlike many other hard hitters he is most wonderfully accurate. He employs an open stance ... and uses the Vardon grip with his right thumb down the shaft. [...] With his irons he is wonderfully accurate ... and he uses an iron putter—and his style does not look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make for delicacy, but he has an extraordinarily fine touch, {{and as a matter}} of fact he was about the best putter there was at Muirfield, hardly ever missing a short one." ...|$|E

But the show looks suspiciously <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{more than willing to}} settle for the mindless glitz of Miami Vice". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "When the smoke clears away, a viewer may feel impressed yet unmoved. But then, if all the smoke cleared away, there'd be no show". John Haslett Cuff, in his review for the Globe and Mail, wrote, [...] "The characters and locales are as greasy as the rain-soaked streets, and in the show's best moments there is a dangerous glitter that happily transcends the cartoon violence of too much television". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin praised the show for being [...] "the most realistic TV cop show in years, yet the emotions reach almost baroque heights".|$|E

President Kennedy was deeply dispirited and angered with the failure. [...] Several years after his death, the New York Times reported that he told an unspecified high administration official of wanting [...] "to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds." [...] However, following a [...] "rigorous inquiry into the agency's affairs, methods, and problems... did not 'splinter' it after all and did not recommend Congressional supervision." [...] Kennedy commented to his journalist friend Ben Bradlee, [...] "The first advice I'm going to give my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{disaster}} of Clallam showed {{the dangers of}} a premature evacuation of people from a vessel into lifeboats. Clallam, a new vessel when she foundered, was sunk in a storm on {{what should have been}} an ordinary voyage across the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Victoria, British Columbia. [...] Clallam (168 feet, 657 tons), was a smaller vessel than Sophia and built of wood. [...] Like Princess Sophia, Clallam was driven by a single propeller turned by a compound steam engine. [...] En route to Victoria BC on 8 January 1904, Clallam, under the command of Capt. George Roberts (b1849), encountered severe weather conditions. [...] At about 3:30p.m., with water rising on board apparently from a broken porthole and improper pumping procedures, Clallam [...] seemed <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> soon sink. Captain Roberts ordered the lifeboats lowered, and into them placed mostly women and children. [...] All three boats capsized or failed to properly launch, drowning all 54 people aboard them. [...] Clallam stayed afloat long enough for rescue vessels to reach her and evacuate the people left on board.|$|E
2500|$|The first 63 {{issues of}} Animal Man {{featuring}} Bolland's artwork covered the tenures of writers Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Tom Veitch and Jamie Delano, with Bolland's images maintaining a continuity {{of style and}} imagery while the interior work underwent several changes of style and storyline. Initially, he recalls that his cover images derived directly from the script. He would [...] "go through and find a scene that looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make a good cover," [...] or [...] "find a particular hook that cleverly summed up what's {{going on inside the}} book." [...] This included the incorporation of photographs into the later covers of Morrison's tale of metafiction and deus ex machina author-input. With the (post-Morrison) move of Animal Man to DC's new 'Mature Readers' imprint Vertigo, Bolland notes that the covers moved to [...] "full color painted covers" [...] with issue No. 57. These of his covers were [...] "a mixture of ink linework, color washes, airbrush and then, eventually, areas painted in poster color by my wife, Rachel," [...] which ultimately saw her have significant input on some covers, with Bolland acknowledging that [...] "some of the last Animal Man covers were more her than me." ...|$|E
