5|$|An Act of Congress created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought <b>a</b> <b>cadet</b> corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built <b>a</b> <b>cadet</b> battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E
5|$|Cadets have a rank {{structure}} {{similar to}} the United States Air Force enlisted and officer grades, excluding those of general officers. <b>A</b> <b>cadet</b> starts as <b>a</b> <b>cadet</b> airman basic, and is promoted {{as he or she}} completes each achievement. Unlike the regular armed forces, where it is possible to enter as either directly as a commissioned following completion of some form of officer training (service academy, college ROTC, or OCS/OTS, etc.), or enlist and eventually advance to non-commissioned officer or petty officer status, a CAP cadet must be promoted through every CAP cadet enlisted grade in order to achieve the rank of CAP cadet second lieutenant. To complete an achievement, <b>a</b> <b>cadet</b> must pass a physical fitness test as well as two written tests, one for leadership and one for aerospace education. The only exceptions to this rule are the promotions to cadet airman and cadet staff sergeant, which have no aerospace test. For some achievements, an additional test of drill proficiency is required. In the new promotion system, effective as of 2010, there is a drill test for all CAP cadet enlisted grades.|$|E
