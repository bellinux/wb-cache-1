25|$|Morse code {{has been}} in use for more than 160 yearslonger than any other {{electrical}} coding system. What is called Morse code today is actually somewhat different from what was originally developed by Vail and Morse. The Modern International Morse code, or continental code, was created by Friedrich Clemens Gerke in 1848 and initially used for telegraphy between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in Germany. Gerke changed {{nearly half of the}} alphabet and all of the numerals, providing the foundation for the modern form of the code. After some minor changes, International Morse Code was standardized at the International Telegraphy Congress in 1865 in Paris and was later made the standard by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Morse's original code specification, largely limited to use in the United States and Canada, became known as <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> or railroad code. <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> is now seldom used except in historical re-enactments.|$|E
2500|$|The Morse {{code was}} {{developed}} so that operators could translate the indentations {{marked on the}} paper tape into text messages. In his earliest code, Morse had planned to transmit only numerals, and to use a codebook to look up each word according to the number which had been sent. However, the code was soon expanded by Alfred Vail in 1840 to include letters and special characters, {{so it could be}} used more generally. Vail estimated the frequency of use of letters in the English language by counting the movable type he found in the type-cases of a local newspaper in Morristown. [...] The shorter marks were called [...] "dots", and the longer ones [...] "dashes", and the letters most commonly used were assigned the shorter sequences of dots and dashes. This code was used since 1844 and became known as Morse landline code or <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Morse code {{is a type}} of {{character}} encoding that transmits telegraphic information using rhythm. Morse code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to represent the letters, numerals, punctuation, and special characters of a given message. After many years of development, an electrical telegraph came to exclusively refer to a signaling telegram, as an operator makes and breaks an electrical contact with a telegraph key, resulting in an audible signal at the other end produced by a telegraph sounder which is interpreted and transcribed by an operator. The short and long elements are formed by sounds, marks, or pulses, in on off keying and are commonly known as [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] or [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". In 1832, Alfred Vail in collaboration with Samuel Morse, began the process of co-inventing the Morse code signalling alphabet. After a few minor changes, including the development of International Morse code which is distinct from the original encoding system, <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> Morse code was standardized in 1865 by the International Telegraphy Congress in Paris, France and later made the norm by the International Telecommunication Union. After 160 years of continuous use, international regulations beginning on January 31, 1999, no longer required ships at sea to call for help in an emergency using Morse code or the famous SOS signal.|$|E

50|$|Over time, {{with the}} {{disappearance}} of landline telegraphy, {{and the end of}} commercial radio use of <b>Morse</b> <b>Code,</b> <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> has become nearly extinct in some states. In the United States, the ranks of amateur radio operators used to include many active and retired commercial landline telegraph operators, who preferred to use <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> for their amateur radio transmissions, so the CW (continuous wave) amateur bands used to have a mixture of <b>American</b> and International <b>Morse.</b> However, today even U.S. amateurs use International Morse almost exclusively.|$|R
5000|$|At the Radiotelegraphic Convention {{meeting in}} London in 1912, {{the section of}} the Convention {{covering}} [...] "Transmission of Radiograms" [...] included the statement that [...] "The signals to be employed are those of Morse International Code." [...] Even after this, the original <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> continued to be used throughout much of the United States. <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> remained the standard for U.S. landline telegraph companies, including the dominant company, Western Union, in part because the original code, with fewer dashes, could be sent about 5% faster than International <b>Morse.</b> <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> also was commonly used for domestic radio transmissions on the Great Lakes, and along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. However, International Morse predominated for ocean-going vessels, and many U.S. shipboard operators became skilled in transmitting both versions of the Code as needed.|$|R

The first study investigated {{the teaching and learning}} strategies of wartime telegraphists to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> Five WRANS described a series of techniques to learn <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> including rote learning and repetition, visualisation and pattern recognition, intoning and mnemonics, and music. Music provided effective training for the fundamental teaching and learning of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> by matching the rhythmical properties of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> to music. Music equipped <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> operators with a unique approach to <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> instruction. Learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with music was described as a way of making sense of the ‘rhythm’ and ‘shape’ of the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> letters and proved an invaluable aid to learning and teaching <b>Morse</b> <b>code.</b> The second study examined the effectiveness of learning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> with the aid of music.

5000|$|The Gerke {{code was}} adopted as a {{standard}} for transmission over cables by the Austro-German Telegraph Union (which included many central European states) {{at a conference in}} 1851.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, radio communication—initially known as [...] "wireless telegraphy"—was invented, and used Morse Code transmissions.

5000|$|Although <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> preceded modern coded {{modulation}} techniques by {{more than}} a century, in terms of Claude Shannon's modern Information Theory, <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> may be regarded essentially as an encoded method of signaling that simultaneously comprises both: a source code (data compression code) and a channel code (modulation <b>code).</b> The <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> source code was created by Samuel Morse's assistant Alfred Vail when Vail assigned the shortest <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols to the most often occurring (English language) source symbols (alpha-numeric characters and punctuation marks), in the style of today's modern data compression codes such as the modern Information Theory based: Huffman, Arithmetic, and Lempel-Ziv-Welsh <b>codes.</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols are variable length sequences of: dot signals, dash signals, and dot duration silent periods. Vail based his <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> on the English language source with the shortest Morse symbol, a sequence composed of a single <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> dot followed by a single dot duration silent period, encoding the most often used English letter [...] "E" [...] with corresponding longer sequences used for less common English letters. Besides assigning <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> symbols to alpha-numeric and punctuation characters of the information source language symbols the early creators of <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> also assigned additional procedural symbols to the <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> related to page formatting of documents and to control and turn over of telegraph communication channels.|$|R

5000|$|<b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> — {{also known}} as Railroad Morse—is the latter-day name for the {{original}} version of the Morse Code developed in the mid-1840s, by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for their electric telegraph.

5000|$|<b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> {{was first}} used on the Baltimore-Washington {{telegraph}} line, a telegraph line constructed between Baltimore, Maryland, and the old Supreme Court chamber in the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. The first public message [...] "" [...] was sent on May 24, 1844, by Morse in Washington to Alfred Vail at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) [...] "outer depot" [...] (now the B&O Railroad Museum) in Baltimore.

5000|$|Gerke {{perceived}} the disadvantages of the <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> and changed {{nearly half of}} it into its present form, the International Telegraph Alphabet. The original Morse code consisted of four different hold durations (the amount of time the key was held down), and some letters contained inconsistent internal durations of silence. In Gerke's system there are only [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs", the latter being three times {{as long as the}} former, and the internal silence intervals are always a single dit-time each. This new code was first adopted by the Deutsch-Oesterreichischer Telegraphenverein and in 1865 accepted by a convent of the International Telegraph Union in Paris.|$|E

This first satellite, like Sputnik 1 was a simple beacon transmitting its message of “HI” for three weeks. The greeting “HI” is used in almost all beacons built and launched by the Amateur Satellite service since 1961. In Amateur Radiotelegraphy the cypher [...] "HI" [...] indicates laughter.

In 1873, land was taken up at Moopina Station near the present townsite, and work commenced on a telegraph line from Albany to Adelaide. Land was set aside at Eucla {{for the establishment of a}} manual repeater station, and when the telegraph line opened in 1877, Eucla was one of the most important telegraph stations on the line. The station was important as a conversion point because South Australia and Victoria used <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code</b> (locally known as the Victorian alphabet) while Western Australia used the international Morse code that is familiar today.|$|E
5000|$|In {{both the}} April 1, 1905, German law, and the 1906 International regulations, the {{distress}} signal was specified {{as a continuous}} Morse code sequence of three-dots/three-dashes/three-dots, with no mention of any alphabetic equivalents. However, in International Morse, three dots comprise the letter S, and three dashes the letter O. It therefore soon became common {{to refer to the}} distress signal as [...] "SOS". An early report on [...] "The International Radio-Telegraphic Convention" [...] in the January 12, 1907, Electrical World stated that [...] "Vessels in distress use the special signal, SOS, repeated at short intervals." [...] (In <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> <b>code,</b> which was used by many coastal ships in the United States through {{the first part of the}} twentieth century, three dashes stood for the numeral [...] "5", so in a few cases the distress signal was informally referred to as [...] "S5S".) ...|$|E

5000|$|The American {{code was}} a little {{different}} to the International <b>Morse</b> <b>Code</b> currently in use. With the American code {{it is easier to}} make timing errors of this sort because there were several more symbol timings than there are in the international code.

There is a distinction between [...] "L" [...] (...) and [...] "T" [...] (...) [...] Also, in the international code the space between symbols within a character is always the same, but <b>American</b> <b>Morse</b> has two different spaces. The letters [...] "S" [...] (...) , [...] "C" [...] (...) , and [...] "R" [...] (...) all consist of three dots, but the timing is different in each case.|$|R
