5|$|Sweet Oblivion, {{released}} in 1992, brought the band to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of commercial success, and the Screaming Trees found itself amidst the sudden {{popularity of the}} Seattle music scene. In 1996, the band released its seventh studio album, Dust; while successful, the album could not emulate the precedent set by Sweet Oblivion. Screaming Trees disbanded in 2000 due to conflicts among the members regarding the band's creative direction.|$|E

5|$|This {{larger scale}} {{building}} activity, from the mid-8th century on, was {{a manifestation of}} the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level.</b> They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example. The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Dan Brown's best-selling 2003 {{conspiracy}} fiction novel The Da Vinci Code and the subsequent 2006 film, there was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a Merovingian sacred king descended from the historical Jesus, the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a mystery cult seeking to restore the feminist theology necessary for a complete understanding of early Christianity, which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, {{as well as in}} his public appearances and interviews.|$|E
5|$|As the {{character}} progresses through the game, experience points (XP) are earned from accomplishing various actions, such as completing a quest, killing an enemy, and so forth, with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> granted upon reaching the necessary amount of XP. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> grants the player {{the ability to}} allocate points to the various Skills available and thus improve upon them, making them more effective; for instance, a higher lock-picking skill allows the player {{to be able to}} tackle more difficult locks on doors and containers, while a higher medicine skill increases the amount of health recovered with Stimpaks. Once {{the character}} achieves their second level, they can be granted a Perk, which offers advantages of varying quality and form, such as being able to carry more items, finding more ammo in containers, and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied, often requiring a certain Skill level to acquire them, while a new Perk can be granted for every two levels earned by the character. Additional improvements to Skill levels can be made by finding Skill books, which confer a permanent boost to levels, while players can also search for and find a series of around 20 bobbleheads that also confer a bonus to these and also primary attributes.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Yiddish {{theater in}} London meant amateur clubs. The arrival of {{professional}} Yiddish actors from Russia worked great changes, bringing Yiddish theater in London to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> and allowing a modest professionalism, though never at {{much more than}} a poverty wage. Adler's memoir acknowledges many people who helped him out in various ways. Eventually, with the aid in particular of Sonya's relative Herman Fiedler—a playwright, orchestra leader, and stage manager—the Adlers and the Grodners were able to take over the Prescott Street Club. There they presented generally serious theater to audiences of about 150. Fiedler adapted The Odessa Beggar from Felix Pyat's The Ragpicker of Paris, a tragicomic play written {{on the eve of the}} Revolutions of 1848. Adler starred in it, in a role he would continue to play throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon {{abandoned by the}} Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself {{is the key to}} pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.|$|E
5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as more complex tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of innovation in their increased efficacy and more complex manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, {{and the use of}} glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|He {{took this}} {{development}} to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> with his 1953 orchestral work Réveil des oiseaux—its material consists {{almost entirely of}} the birdsong one might hear between midnight and noon in the Jura. From this period onwards, Messiaen incorporated birdsong into all of his compositions and composed several works for which birds provide both the title and subject matter (for example the collection of thirteen pieces for piano Catalogue d'oiseaux completed in 1958, and La fauvette des jardins of 1971). Paul Griffiths observed that Messiaen was a more conscientious ornithologist than any previous composer, and a more musical observer of birdsong than any previous ornithologist.|$|E

Queens of the Stone Age released a follow-up album, Lullabies to Paralyze, in 2005. The album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200, selling 97,000 copies during its first week. Two years later, the band released its fifth studio album, Era Vulgaris, which debuted and peaked at number fourteen on the Billboard 200.|$|E

5|$|Jan van Eyck's {{use of oil}} as {{a medium}} was a {{significant}} development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated, indicates {{the extent to which}} van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments, and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from Bohemia and Poland in the east to Austria and Swabia in the south.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and The Kiss. With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
5|$|Still Impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler {{asked her}} to film Triumph des Willens ("Triumph of the Will"), a new {{propaganda}} film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg. More than one million Germans participated in the rally. Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted {{and did not want}} to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland ("Lowlands"). Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph des Willens on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl. The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking. The film took Riefenstahl's career to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> and gave her further international recognition.|$|E
