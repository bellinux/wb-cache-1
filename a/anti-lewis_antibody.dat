40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{involved}} in gastritis, gastric and duodenal ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Earlier studies already suggested a role for autoimmune phenomena in H. pylori-linked disease. We now report that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of H. pylori express Lewis y, Lewis x, and H type I blood group structures similar to those commonly occurring in gastric mucosa. Immunization of mice and rabbits with H. pylori cells or purified LPS induced an anti-Lewis x or y or anti-H type I response, yielding antibodies that bound human and murine gastric glandular tissue, granulocytes, adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma cells. Experimental oral infections in mice or natural infection in humans yielded <b>anti-Lewis</b> <b>antibodies</b> also. The beta chain of gastric (H+,K+) -ATPase, the parietal cell proton pump involved in acid secretion, contained Lewis y epitopes; gastric mucin contained Lewis x and y antigenic determinants. Growth in mice of a hybridoma that secretes H. pylori-induced <b>anti-Lewis</b> y monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> resulted in histopathological evidence of gastritis, which indicates a direct pathogenic role for <b>anti-Lewis</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that molecular mimicry between H. pylori LPS and the host, based on Lewis antigens, and provide understanding of an autoimmune mechanism for H. pylori-associated type B gastritis...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have shown}} 3625 testing blood samples of {{pregnant}} women from 2005 to 2010 {{on the presence of}} irregular antibodies in Lewis system, which was done by routine methods, and by using appropriate “screening” tests and the panel for identification of antibodies. In addition to other <b>antibodies,</b> <b>anti-Lewis</b> <b>antibodies</b> were found in 0. 2 %, as follows: anti- Lea in 5, anti- Leb in 2, but anti- Lea+b weren’t found. We have confirmed that the phenotype Le (a-b-) in pregnant women is significantly more active versus tested population. If the anti- Lea antibodies (IgM class) are harmless, the rare anti- Leb antibodies (IgG class) could be dangerous for the fetus. Although the clinical significance of anti-Le antibody has not been fully proven, and although their immunogenicity is low, we suggest test these antibodies in all pregnant women in relationship to their essential role in the transfusions, the sensitization of the fetus and the risk of hemolysis...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the early events of Helicobacter pylori infection in a mouse model, CD 1 mice were infected with a type I (CagA+/VacA+) H. pylori strain. Up to 4 weeks after infection {{the majority of}} gastric tissue biopsies were positive in culture. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that inflammatory changes started to occur after 3 weeks. Four weeks after infection {{a significant increase in}} T cells was observed in the cardia/corpus region of the stomachs of infected mice. These T cells were CD 4 + and CD 8 +, and they were located in an area with increased expression of MHC class II antigens. In 50 % of the infected mice also an increased number of mast cells was seen. Furthermore, aggregates of B and T cells were present in the submucosa. Characterization of cytokines by immunohistochemistry showed an increase in IL- 5 -secreting cells in the inflamed area of the infected stomach. No difference was observed between interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) -, IL- 4 - and IL- 10 -secreting cells in control and infected mice. These results suggest that no polarized T-helper cell response was present at this early phase of infection. Infection with H. pylori also induced a serum response and especially IgG was increased after 4 weeks of infection. However, no particular increase in IgG 1, IgG 2 a or IgG 3 isotype was observed. Part of the serum antibodies was directed against lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but no evidence for <b>anti-Lewis</b> <b>antibodies</b> or antibodies against epitopes on the gastric mucosa was found...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) and their receptors are {{expressed}} {{in a variety of}} mammalian tissues, playing a role in development and cell proliferation. While analyzing human sperm motility, we found that sperm treated with endo-β-galactosidase (EBG), which specifically hydrolyzes poly-N-acetyllactosamine type glycans (polyLacs), enhanced motility. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that sperm-associated polyLacs are heavily fucosylated, consistent with Lewis Y antigen. Immunohistochemistry of epididymis using an <b>anti-Lewis</b> Y <b>antibody</b> before and after EBG treatment suggested that polyLacs carrying the Lewis Y epitope are synthesized in epididymal epithelia and secreted to seminal fluid. EBG-treated sperm elevated cAMP levels and calcium influx, indicating activation of fibroblast growth factor signaling. Seminal fluid polyLacs bound to FGFs in vitro, and impaired FGF-mediated signaling in HEK 293 T cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lewis y antigen is difucosylated {{oligosaccharide}} and {{is carried}} by glycoconjugates at cell surface. Elevated expression of Lewis y {{has been found}} in 75 % of ovarian tumor, and the high expression level is correlated to the tumor's pathological staging and prognosis. This study was to investigate the effect and the possible mechanism of Lewis y on the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells. Methods We constructed a plasmid encoding α 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase (α 1, 2 -FT) gene and then transfected it into ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells with lowest Lewis y antigen expression level. Effect of Lewis y on cell proliferation was assessed after transfection. Changes in cell survival and signal transduction were evaluated after α-L-fucosidase, <b>anti-Lewis</b> y <b>antibody</b> and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) inhibitor treatment. Results Our results showed that the levels of α 1, 2 -FT gene and Lewis y increased significantly after transfection. The cell proliferation of ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells sped up as the Lewis y antigen was increased. Both of α-L-fucosidase and <b>anti-Lewis</b> y <b>antibody</b> inhibited the cell proliferation. The phosphorylation level of Akt was apparently elevated in Lewis y-overexpressing cells and the inhibitor of PI 3 K, LY 294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Lewis y-overexpressing cells. In addition, the phosphorylation intensity and difference in phosphorylation intensity between cells with different expression of α 1, 2 -FT were attenuated significantly by the monoantibody to Lewis y and by the PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002. Conclusions Increased expression of Lewis y antigen {{plays an important role in}} promoting cell proliferation through activating PI 3 K/Akt signaling pathway in ovarian carcinoma-derived RMG-I cells. Inhibition of Lewis y expression may provide a new therapeutic approach for Lewis y positive ovarian cancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of cell-type-specific delivery systems is highly desirable for gene-therapeutic applications. Current virus-based vector systems show broad cell specificity, {{which results in}} the need to restrict the natural tropism of these viral systems. Here we demonstrate that tumour-cell-specific virus-like particles can be functionally assembled in vitro from recombinant viral coat protein expressed in Escherichia coli. The insertion of a negatively charged peptide in the HI loop of polyoma VP 1 interferes with the binding of VP 1 to the natural recognition site on mammalian cells and also serves as an adapter for the coupling of antibody fragments that contain complementary charged fusion peptides. A recombinant antibody fragment of the tumour-specific <b>anti-(Lewis</b> Y) <b>antibody</b> B 3 could be coupled to the mutant VP 1 by engineered polyionic peptides and an additional disulphide bond. With this system an entirely recombinant cell-specific delivery system assembled in vitro could be generated that transfers genes preferentially to cells presenting the tumour-specific antigen on the cell surface...|$|R
40|$|We have {{purified}} lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from 10 Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates {{which were}} selected {{on the basis}} of chemotype and antigenic variation. Data from immunoblotting of the purified LPS with sera from humans with H. pylori infection and from absorption of the sera with LPS indicated the presence of two distinct epitopes, termed the highly antigenic and the weakly antigenic epitopes, on the polysaccharide chains. Among 68 H. pylori clinical isolates, all smooth strains possessed either epitope; the epitopes were each carried by about 50 % of the smooth strains. Thus, H. pylori strains can be classified into three types on the basis of their antigenicity in humans: those with smooth LPS carrying the highly antigenic epitope, those with smooth LPS carrying the weakly antigenic epitope, and those with rough LPS. Sera from humans with H. pylori infection could be grouped into three categories: those containing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the highly antigenic epitope, those containing IgG against the weakly antigenic epitope, and those containing both specific IgGs; these groups made up about 50 %, less than 10 %, and about 40 %, respectively, of all infected sera tested. In other words, IgG against the highly antigenic epitope were detected in more than 90 % of H. pylori-infected individuals with high titers. IgG against the weakly antigenic epitope were detected in about 50 % of the sera tested; however, the antibody titers were low. The two human epitopes existed independently from the mimic structures of Lewis antigens, which are known to be an important epitope of H. pylori LPS. No significant relationship between the reactivities toward purified LPS of human sera and a panel of <b>anti-Lewis</b> antigen <b>antibodies</b> was found. Moreover, the reactivities of the <b>anti-Lewis</b> antigen <b>antibodies,</b> but not human sera, were sensitive to particular α-l-fucosidases. The human epitopes appeared to be located on O-polysaccharide chains containing endo-β-galactosidase-sensitive galactose residues as the backbone. Data from chemical analyses indicated that all LPS commonly contained galactose, glucosamine, glucose, and fucose (except one rough strain) as probable polysaccharide components, together with typical components of inner core and lipid A. We were not able to distinguish between the differences of antigenicity in humans by on the basis of the chemical composition of the LPS...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Lewis y overexpression on the expression of proliferation-related factors in ovarian cancer cells. Methods: mRNA levels of cyclins, CDKs, and CKIs were measured in cells before and after transfection with the α 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase gene by real-time PCR, and protein levels of cyclins, CDKs and CKIs were determined in cells before and after gene transfection by Western blot. Results: Lewis y overexpression led {{to an increase in}} both mRNA and protein expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin D 1 and cyclin E in ovarian cancer cells, decrease in both mRNA and protein expression levels of p 16 and p 21, and decrease of p 27 at only the protein expression level without change in its mRNA level. There were no differences in proteins and the mRNA levels of CDK 2, CDK 4 and CDK 6 before and after gene transfection. <b>Anti-Lewis</b> y <b>antibody,</b> ERK and PI 3 K pathway inhibitors PD 98059 and LY 294002 reduced the difference in cyclin and CKI expression caused by Lewis y overexpression.

40|$|Background: Red {{blood cell}} (RBC) alloantibodies may be formed {{following}} exposure to RBC antigens. In most cases, the alloimmunization develops during pregnancy or from previous blood transfusions. The RBC antigens and their alloantibodies vary among different human populations and ethnic groups, {{and they do}} have a clinical significance for their adverse immunological reactions. Aims: This study aimed at studying the prevalence of RBC alloantibodies at the Blood Transfusion Unit of Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II in Kota Bharu, Malaysia. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed utilizing data obtained in the years 2007 and 2008. Data of antibody screening tests from 5719 patients were examined. Results and Discussion: The overall prevalence of alloimmunization was 65 (1. 13 &#x 0025;). The majority of these had a single alloantibody (76. 9 &#x 0025;), whereas the remaining 23. 1 &#x 0025; had multiple antibodies. The anti-E antibody comprised the most common alloantibody (24. 6 &#x 0025;) followed by the <b>anti-Lewis</b> (a) <b>antibodies</b> (18. 5 &#x 0025;) and the anti-M antibody (13. 8 &#x 0025;). There were more female recipients than males. Conclusions: It was concluded that the findings of this work have been comparable with other published works, and that the main factors associated with alloantibody formation were multiple transfusions and pregnancies. The study also emphasizes the necessity for carrying out immunohematology studies prior to every blood transfusion especially in cases that require multiple transfusions {{for a long period of}} time such as in thalassemia patients...|$|R
40|$|Lewis (y) antigen is a difucosylated {{oligosaccharide}} {{present on}} the plasma membrane, and its overexpression is frequently found in human cancers and {{has been shown to}} be associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that Lewis (y) antigen plays a positive role in the process of invasion and metastasis of ovarian cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which Lewis (y) antigen enhances the invasion and tumor metastasis are still unknown. In this study, we established a stable cell line constitutively expressing Lewis (y) antigen (RMG- 1 -hFUT) by transfecting the cDNA encoding part of the human α 1, 2 -fucosyltransferase (α 1, 2 -FUT) gene into the ovarian cancer cell line RMG- 1, and investigated whether Lewis (y) antigen regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) and MMP- 9, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP- 1) and TIMP- 2. We found that RMG- 1 -hFUT cells exhibited higher invasive capacities than their control cells. In addition, expression of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 was down-regulated and expression of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 was up-regulated. <b>Anti-Lewis</b> (y) antigen <b>antibody</b> treatment significantly reversed the expression of TIMP- 1, TIMP- 2, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that down-regulation of TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 and up-regulation of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 represents one of the mechanisms by which Lewis (y) antigen promotes cell invasion...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{single-chain}} {{variable fragment}} (scFv) constructs {{has been investigated}} in cancer radioimmunotherapy (RIT) and radioimmunodetection, as these molecules permit rapid tumor penetration and clearance from the serum relative to whole IgG. Multimerization of scFv constructs has demonstrated improvements in functional affinity (i. e., avidity) and maximal tumor uptake. In this paper, we report the first biodistribution and pharmacokinetics studies of a noncovalent, direct-linked scFv (VL- 0 -VH) trimeric/tetrameric “multimer” of the <b>anti-Lewis</b> Y monoclonal <b>antibody,</b> hu 3 S 193. The in vitro binding and in vivo biodistribution of the hu 3 S 193 multimer was characterized alongside the hu 3 S 193 F(ab′) 2 following radiolabeling with the Indium- 111 (111 In) radioisotope. Immunoreactivities of the radiolabeled multimer and F(ab′) 2 were 73 % and 53. 2 %, and binding affinities (Ka) were 1. 58 × 107 M− 1 and 4. 31 × 106 M− 1 for the multimer and F(ab′) 2, respectively. Maximal tumor uptake in Ley-positive MCF- 7 breast cancer xenografted BALB/c nude mice was 12. 6 ± 2. 5 percent injected dose/per gram (%ID/g) at 6 hours postinjection for the multimer and 15. 7 ± 2. 1 %ID/g at 24 hours postinjection for the F(ab′) 2. However, limited in vitro stability and high renal localization of radiolabeled constructs were observed, which, despite the observed tumor targeting of the hu 3 S 193 multimer, most likely preclude its use in RIT and imaging modalities...|$|R
