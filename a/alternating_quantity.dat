40|$|Understanding {{granular}} {{and other}} athermal systems requires {{the identification of}} state variables which consistently predict their bulk properties. A promising approach has been {{to draw on the}} techniques of equilibrium statistical mechanics, but to consider <b>alternate</b> conserved <b>quantities</b> in place of energy. The Edwards ensemble, based on volume conservation, provides a temperaturelike intensive parameter called compactivity. We present experiments which demonstrate the failure of compactivity to equilibrate (via volume-exchange) between a pair of externally-agitated granular subsystems with different material properties. Nonetheless, we identify a material-independent relationship between the mean and fluctuations of the local packing fraction which forms the basis for an equation of state. This relationship defines an intensive parameter that decouples from the volume statistics. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R
40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: Four {{different}} control {{strategies for}} {{the control of the}} inverter currents of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system are analysed and evaluated by means of simulation using Matlab/Simulink. Special attention is paid to the behaviour of the generator during asymmetrical grid voltage dips. Different control schemes are employed to reduce torque and DC-link voltage oscillations and the resulting additional loads on the system during such dips. The field-oriented control (FOC) scheme is the one usually deployed for the control of DFIGs in wind power plants and is used as the reference system within this study. The inverter currents are regulated by proportional-integral controllers (PI) in a rotating coordinate system in which they are represented by dq-components. These components are direct quantities. A positive-negative-sequence current control (PNC) strategy is used to control the positive-sequence currents and the negative-sequence currents separately in two contra-rotating coordinate systems using PI-controllers. In contrast to the first two control strategies, frequency-selective current controllers (FSC) serve to regulate the currents in a static coordinate system. In this case the currents are represented by two components which are <b>alternating</b> <b>quantities.</b> Combining the FSC and PNC strategies will produce frequency-selective positive-negative-sequence current controllers (FSC(PN)). These control the currents in a static coordinate system. The currents are represented by alternating components as in frequency-selective control but separate reference values for the negative-sequence currents are provided as in positive-negative-sequence control. Theoretical reasoning suggests and simulations prove that the three proposed alternative control strategies can improve the behaviour of DFIG-systems during slight asymmetries in the grid voltage. During severe dips the effect is limited by several constraints, namely by the inverter rating (limited inverter voltages and currents), by time delays introduced by the component calculation for PNC and FSC(PN) and by the nonlinear behaviour of the DFIG-system (saturation of mutual inductance). Nevertheless, the proposed novel control strategies could be applied beneficially to other systems, such as photovoltaic inverters or full-scale inverters for wind power plants...|$|R

Our main {{result is that}} the structure of dates at which firms choose to absorb information differ starkly between price and quantity competition. Firms synchronize their actions under price competition whereas they plan sequentially and in an <b>alternating</b> manner under <b>quantity</b> competition. The reason is that under quantity competition the planning firm reduces the uncertainty in the residual demand curve of the inattentive firm which renders planning less attractive for that firm.

40|$|The term Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) {{refers to}} the {{technology}} that enables a bidirectional power exchange between the electric grid and the batteries of plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). V 2 G technology can be {{a key element of}} the intelligent network, which may use the batteries of the vehicle as a system of local storage. The vehicle battery may contribute to the stability of the grid and to meeting the energy demand, especially in peak hours. A PEV needs a bidirectional charger to implement V 2 G, and, consequently, the studies regarding their design, functionality and efficiency are of the utmost interest. This thesis describes the state of art of these chargers and discusses some aspects of a bi-directional converter and some case studies related to this topic. The main objective of this work is to develop the design and the control algorithms of a bidirectional battery charger with capability to charge the battery of a PEV and simultaneously to act as an active filter for the supply line. After the first introductory chapter, the second chapter reports the terminology used in this field of research. Several smart strategies for charging, approaches for the implementation of the battery chargers for PEVs and the recharging standards are briefly described. The analysis of different types of charger is detailed in chapter three. The conventional battery chargers (CBC) with front-end formed by a diode rectifier, battery chargers with power factor correction (PFC), bi-directional battery chargers (BBC), and integral battery chargers (IBC) are considered. In chapter four, definitions are given of the electrical power in non-sinusoidal conditions, together with some examples of the inadequacies of the classical power theory in describing non-linear phenomena that occur during the operation of a power system. The fifth chapter presents the basic concepts of the theory of instantaneous active and reactive power (also known as p-q theory) applied to the compensation of non-sinusoidal systems. Definition of real, imaginary and zero sequence power are introduced and it is shown how this theory makes it easier to understand the phenomena caused by non-sinusoidal voltages or currents. The theory is particularly suitable for the design of a battery charger when it is seen as a power conditioner. Chapter six is devoted to the basic concepts of shunt active filters. They can perform different types of functions, such as the compensation of current harmonics generated by nonlinear loads to prevent their propagation in the network. The compensation algorithm based on powers defined in reference  is very flexible and therefore the theory of instantaneous power has been considered {{as the basis for the}} development of the control system of active filters. Some examples of compensation described in the previous chapter were simulated and the results have been included. In chapter seven, sizing of the power devices that constitute the battery charger is considered in relation to the various auxiliary services that it can provide. The power electronic switches, the coupling inductors and the other passive components have been sized in voltage and current. In chapter eight it is considered a charger that supplies its load and simultaneously compensates for non-linear loads connected nearby. These additional features in terms of power conditioning were quantified in order to determine the capacity of a battery charger that is formed by given active and passive components to support the network acting as an active filter. In the ninth chapter the filter inductances of a battery charger are sized for a specific case study in which it is required the capability to recharge the battery and to inject active power in the network, both in the case of single-phase and three-phase connection. Evaluation of the ripple current is an important requirement for the design of inductors. Therefore a precise calculation was made of this magnitude both in the case of a battery charger connected to the single phase grid and operating according to the PWM technique, and, in the case of connection to the three-phase grid, operating according to the technique SVM. In chapter ten a case study is considered regarding the design of an LCL filter. Chapter eleven contains a theoretical study of resonant controllers. They solve the problem posed by the conventional PI controllers that, when used for the control of <b>alternate</b> <b>quantities</b> as it occurs for the currents of a DC/AC converter, are not able to cancel the steady state error due to the finite gain at the operating frequency. Instead, a resonant controller has a gain ideally infinite at the operating frequency and thus ensures a zero steady-state error. The effectiveness of the resonant regulators has been verified by means of simulations. Chapter twelve deals with the regulations regarding connectors, charging modes and ways of connecting the PEV chargers to the grid. They are intended to define a charging procedure common to all the PEVs and to all the charging infrastructures, whether public or private. ...|$|R
40|$|The Forest Service {{controls}} {{vast quantities}} of natural resources including timber, wildlife, watersheds, air sheds, and ecosystems. For many of these resources, recreation {{is one of the}} primary uses of the natural asset. Recreation visits taken to National Forests are not "purchased" in the same type of market as other goods (e. g., timber, grazing, or housing). The price of, and ultimately benefit received from, recreation to National Forests cannot be estimated via traditional market prices and <b>quantities.</b> <b>Alternate</b> methods must be employed to estimate the value of recreation access. We use on-site survey data from the Forest Service's National Visitor Use Monitoring database (2000 - 2003) and stated preference demand estimation methods to model annual recreation trip-taking behavior to National Forests. We then use these models to derive estimates of per-visit net economic benefits across regions and activities. In 2000, the FS began conducting systematic research into recreation visitation levels on National Forest lands under the National Visitor Use Monitoring Project (NVUM). From 2000 to 2003 NVUM has collected data from 120 National Forests providing information on the number of annual visits, primary activity, local area expenditures, satisfaction with facilities, and limited demographic information. These data were collected using an on-site stratified random sampling scheme resulting in over 90, 000 completed surveys. Using the NVUM data we estimate the net economic value (NEV) of recreation on National Forest lands. The dataset used to estimate these values contains 73, 655 observations. Using a truncated negative binomial estimator, weighted by a composite factor that adjusts for the stratified, on-site nature of the data, we have estimated a series of pooled, multi-site recreation demand models and calculated net economic values for recreational visits to the National Forests for each of fourteen activities and four RPA regions (Pacific, Rocky Mountain, Northern, and Southern) on a per visit per individual value and for a per activity day per individual basis. Our results indicate that for most models and specifications, adjusting for the choice based sampling frame by using a truncated, weighted, stratified, negative binomial estimator, as well as accounting for regional and activity differences, reduces the estimate of the average per day and per activity day values. Forest managers and others involved in managing, planning, and administering resources used for recreation often need an estimate of the economic value of the resource. For many of these resources non-market analysis must be used to generate this information. For forest recreation, many of the values currently available come from secondary sources or from small samples. The values estimated using NVUM represent an improvement over many of the currently available forest recreation values because of the unique nature of the large-scale, stratified random sample.
