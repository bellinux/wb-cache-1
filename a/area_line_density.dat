For line widths inferior to 4 pun, hillocks are located at the line edge. As <b>line</b> <b>density</b> increases, the number of hillocks remains constant but their mean volume proportionally increases. For wider lines, hillocks preferentially nucleate {{at the center of}} the line. The number of hillocks proportionally increases as <b>line</b> <b>density</b> increases, but hillock mean volume remains constant. Post Si(C) N hillocks density is found to be proportional to post CMP Cu grain surface boundary density before capping. It is proposed that hillocks growth could be controlled by Cu/Ta interface diffusion on narrowest lines and by grain boundary diffusion on wider ones. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

We developed a mechanistic first passage time model, based on an anisotropic elliptic partial differential equation, and used this to explore how wolf movement responses to seismic lines influence the encounter rate of the wolves with their prey. The model was parametrized using 5 min GPS location data. These data showed that wolves travelled faster on seismic lines and had a higher probability of staying on a seismic line once they were on it. We simulated wolf movement on a range of seismic <b>line</b> <b>densities</b> and drew implications for the rate of predator-prey interactions as described by the functional response. The functional response exhibited a more than linear increase with respect to prey density (type III) as well as interactions with seismic <b>line</b> <b>density.</b> Encounter rates were significantly higher in landscapes with high seismic <b>line</b> <b>density</b> and were most pronounced at low prey densities.

In {{order to obtain}} the maximum {{neutralization}} of energetic ions (providing maximum neutral beam power) and reduce the heat load on beamline internal components caused by residual energetic ions, sufficient neutral gas must be injected into the beamline neutralizer cell.

Hydrodynamics of such liquid is well described in terms of two-fluid model. Superfluid helium is also capable of developing turbulent flow, called quantum turbulence, through randomization of distribution and orientation of vortex lines. Quantum turbulence in superfluid helium generated by mechanically driven pure superflow was studied by measuring the vortex <b>line</b> <b>density</b> in 10 × 10 mm 2 square channel using the attenuation of second sound technique. Agreement with results predicted by Vinen's equation was found in steady state.

The ablated material is produced by focusing a KrF excimer laser (248 nm,< 1 J, 40 ns) onto a solid iron target. The LAAPD ion source configuration employs an annular electrode {{in front of the}} grounded target. Simultaneous to the excimer laser striking the target, a three‐element, inductor–capacitor, pulse‐forming network is discharged across the electrode–target gap. Peak discharge parameters of 3600 V and 680 A yield a peak discharge power of 1. 3 MW through the laser ablation plume. Iron neutral atom <b>line</b> <b>densities</b> are measured by tuning the dye laser near the 271. 903 nm (a[*] 5 D–y[*] 5 P 0) ground‐state and 273. 358 nm (a[*] 5 F–w[*] 5 D 0) excited‐state transitions while iron singly ionized <b>line</b> <b>densities</b> are measured using the 263. 105 nm (a[*] 6 D–z[*] 6 D 0) and 273. 955 nm (a[*] 4 D–z[*] 4 D 0) excited‐state transitions. The <b>line</b> <b>density,</b> expansion velocity, temperature, and number of each species have been characterized as a function of time for laser ablation and the LAAPD. Data analysis assuming a Boltzmann distribution yields the ionization ratio (ni/nn) and indicates that the laser ablation plume is substantially ionized.

40|$|This {{review paper}} puts {{together}} {{some of our}} results concerning the application of non equilibrium Thermodynamics to superfluid liquid helium. Two {{of the most important}} situations of this quantum fluid are rotating superfluid and superfluid turbulence, both characterized by the presence of quantized vortices (vortex lines whose core is about 1 Angstrom and the quantum of circulation is h/m, h being the Plank's constant and m the mass of helium atom). In {{the first part of the}} work a non-standard model of superfluid helium, which considers heat flux as independent variable, is briefly recalled, and compared with the well known two-fluid model, in absence of vortices, proposed by Tisza and Landau more than half a century ago. The model is generalized taking into account the presence of vortices in different cases of physical interest: rotating superfluids, counterflow superfluid turbulence (a particular situation in which no mass flux but only heat flux is present) and combined situations of counterflow and rotation. Since vortices are not fixed when all the hydrodynamical fields change, an additional scalar quantity, the averaged vortex <b>line</b> <b>density</b> per unit volume L, <b>line</b> <b>density</b> for short, is introduced in the model as a new field variable and an evolution equation is written for it, both in linear and in nonlinear regimes, via Extended Thermodynamics. Finally, to encompass more general situations, the model is further extended considering the flux of vortex <b>line</b> <b>density</b> as an independent new variable. In all these models the propagation of harmonic waves is studied, motivated by the fact that vortex <b>lines</b> <b>density</b> is experimentally detected via the attenuation of second sound.
