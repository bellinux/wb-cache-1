40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> policies {{are driven by}} the powerful states which intervene to align policy with their preferences. In particular, many {{have argued that the}} United States uses its position as the Fund’s largest shareholder to achieve its foreign policy objectives. As a result, a substantial volume of literature argues and presents evidence to support the claim that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> decisions faithfully reflect US interests. My findings extend these claims. Using a new dataset on the presence in International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements of binding conditions, which cause the agreement to be suspended or terminated if they are not met, I demonstrate that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements contain fewer binding conditions when a suspension of International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> lending plausibly would impose greater hardship on creditor country banks and exporters...|$|R

The concept behind the {{creation}} of Investcorp was devised and implemented at the <b>Arab</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> (AMF) during the period 1980-1982, when Dr. Jawad Hashim was its President. In July 1980 Hashim employed Nemir Kirdar {{as one of his}} advisors on one-year secondment from Chase Manhattan Bank. Initially, Kirdar’s task was to prepare certain feasibility studies in connection with the development of Arab financial markets, promotion of Arab monetary and economic integration and the quest for investment opportunities for the surplus of the oil-exporting Arab countries. Kirdar delivered a report entitled: <b>ARAB</b> <b>MONETARY</b> <b>FUND</b> PROJECT: ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRIVATE INVESTMENT COMPANY. [...] Under the auspices of AMF and on its expense, a new financial institution, Investcorp, was created in 1981/1982. Kirdar would later assert that Investcorp was his “brainchild” without reference to the AMF's role in its creation. [...] To pay for his share subscription in Investcorp, Kirdar requested a second loan for US$600,000 from Dr. Hashim in March 1981.|$|E
