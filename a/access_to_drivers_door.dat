50|$|The <b>driver's</b> <b>door</b> {{provides}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>driver’s</b> cockpit, and <b>to</b> {{the rear}} jump seat. The {{other side of}} the car is a purposely asymmetrical arrangement. Eliminating the glovebox and minimizing the instrument panel allows shifting the front passenger about six-inches ahead of the driver’s seating position. In turn, the second inside passenger, sitting in tandem behind the inside passenger, has approximately the same leg, shoulder, and headroom as the front passenger. The Kabura includes a secondary passenger-side door, allowing easier <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the seat behind the front passenger. After the front door is opened, touching a button slides the rear door straight back into a cavity notched into the rear-quarter panel area, instead of swinging on hinges.|$|R

50|$|A newer {{method of}} administration, and especially, deployment, is now {{available}} through a product known as Designer. A free companion to IDM, Designer is written in Eclipse and runs on either a Linux or Windows workstation. Because it is a fat client it {{does not need to}} be connected to any networks to make changes <b>to</b> <b>drivers</b> though it does need to deploy changes for them to take effect. Designer is made to speed up the process of deploying new drivers and modifying and testing existing drivers by removing the multiple-click requirement that comes with any web interface, and offering quicker <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>driver</b> configuration settings. As of Designer 3.0, Designer also provides Subversion based version control. This simplifies development of an IDM implementation in a team environment, and also provides <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a history of changes made to IDM objects.|$|R

50|$|Devices {{connected}} by a single USB port may function as multiple USB devices, {{one of which is}} a USB mass-storage device. This simplifies distribution and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>drivers</b> and documentation, primarily for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. Such <b>drivers</b> are required <b>to</b> make full use of the device, usually because it does not fit a standard USB class or has additional functionality. An embedded USB mass-storage device makes it possible <b>to</b> install additional <b>drivers</b> without CD-ROM disks, floppies or Internet <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a vendor website; this is important, since many modern systems are supplied without optical or floppy drives. Internet access may be unavailable because the device provides network access (wireless, GSM or Ethernet cards). The embedded USB mass storage is usually made permanently read-only by the vendor, preventing accidental corruption and use for other purposes (although it may be updated with proprietary protocols when performing a firmware upgrade). Advantages of this method of distribution are lower cost, simplified installation and ensuring driver portability.|$|R
50|$|Clark was {{involved}} in the fatal crash of V8 Supercar driver Mark Porter at Mount Panorama Circuit. In an effort to avoid the stalled Porter, he slid his car sideways whilst travelling at high speed. The front right hand side of his car hit the <b>driver's</b> side <b>door</b> of Porter's car, crushing the side of the car. The front right hand of Porter's car also hit the <b>drivers</b> <b>door</b> of Clark, critically injuring him. Marshals were quick to arrive at the scene where one, unable <b>to</b> open the <b>driver's</b> <b>door</b> on Porter's car, opened the rear door in an attempt to check his condition. Both drivers were unconscious at the time. The race was called to an immediate stop and all racing was suspended for two hours while police combed for clues as to what happened.|$|R
50|$|The train {{operates}} every day. At 11:30 am, {{the station}} gates are opened {{to allow the}} passengers for the next trip into the vehicle staging area. Here, the vehicles are assigned their number, which is affixed <b>to</b> the <b>driver's</b> <b>door</b> magnetically. The vehicle is typically video surveyed to document any preexisting dents and other damage, in the event a damage claim is later filed. The passengers leave their vehicles here and take their carry-on bags with them into the station to await boarding. The vehicles are then staged near the autorack ramps by size and length for optimal loading order, and are then loaded onto the autoracks. In the case of motorcycles, the owner assists with tying their bikes down to a dedicated motorcycle carrier which is then loaded into the autorack. Passengers do not have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their vehicles during the trip. Amtrak offers Priority Offloading, a time-saving option that would ensure that when the train reaches Lorton or Sanford, their vehicle {{would be one of}} the first 30 vehicles offloaded from the autoracks.|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{interface}} between the theme of "transport-related social exclusion" and resource allocation in a household. The study posits the "license to drive" as a skill which affects the family as a whole. The consequences of expensive driver's license (DL) within the domain of family structure, gender {{and its implications for}} the non-western immigrants in Norway are discussed. Further we analyse how decision-making within a family and the tenets of social exclusion are therefore affected both by the availability of public transport and price of procuring a driving license in the Norwegian context. Through assessing the linkages between expensive driver's license and its substitution elasticity by public transport, we arrive at a surprising possibility that for high values on both factors, an additional increase to the substitution elasticity (improved public transport) may lead to further social exclusion for certain groups through a denied <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>driver's</b> license.

40|$|Immigration raids, {{used with}} {{increasing}} frequency in the United States in 2016, exemplify the reach of immigration law enforcement {{into the lives of}} Latino community members. Yet little research characterizes their health implications. Using a mixed methods critical case study design and a conceptual framework of illegality, this study investigates the health implications of a collaborative immigration raid that occurred in Washtenaw County, Michigan, on November 7, 2013. Quantitative data come from the Encuesta Buenos Vecinos, a community survey of Latinos in Washtenaw County. Qualitative data come from participant observation with law enforcement and the mixed-status Latino community in which the raid occurred, as well as interviews with 1) individuals directly involved in the raid, 2) members of social networks of individuals directly involved in the raid, and 3) representatives of social service and community organizations in the community in which the raid occurred. Findings provide strong evidence that immigration raids have negative effects on the well-being of Latinos in mixed-status communities. The social networks of those involved in the raid moderated its negative impacts by providing social and economic support. However, the sociocultural context that included 1) police and immigration enforcement collaboration; 2) policies that restrict <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>driver’s</b> licenses; and 3) law enforcement that prioritizes drug laws and ignores collateral damage (that is, damage inflicted on unintended targets); contributed to an environment in which individuals avoided encounters in which their immigration statuses may be disclosed. This avoidance limited the ameliorative impact of social networks and <b>access</b> <b>to</b> needed services. Implications from these findings suggest that social service organizations need to provide a range of services in accessible locations after immigration raids to support those directly involved, their families, and other community members; and that local police would be more effective in maintaining relationships with Latino communities if they did not enforce immigration law. Policies that support <b>access</b> <b>to</b> legal <b>driver’s</b> licenses among undocumented immigrants and end the use of collaborative immigration raids—especially those that target recently arrived mothers and children from Central America—would promote the health of Latinos in mixed-status communities...|$|R
50|$|The {{sharp-edged}} body design had a {{drag coefficient}} (cd) of 0.37 and was purchased from NSU of Germany, after the German firm had abandoned {{its plans to}} launch its own small car, the based on the NSU Prinz rear-engined NSU Nergal model, presented as a prototype in the 1970 Turin Motor Show and designed by the Italian designer Aldo Sessano. It was Antoni Amat, the technical director of Inducar (Industrias de la Carrocería) i.e. an external provider for SEAT, the man who conceived the idea of proposing the whole project to SEAT with the mediation of Günter Óistrach, after the former's visit and contacts at the Turin Motor Show, with the Terrassa-based Inducar company undertaking from SEAT {{the production of the}} chassis for its SEAT 1200 Sport car. The purchased rights Nergal design had been sublimed to modifications in a mixture of elements with another Sessano's concept car i.e. the OTAS KL112, in order to fit in with the underpinnings meant to be used by SEAT, as it was based upon the ones of a Fiat 127. However the remainings of the original NSU Nergal design were still present in the SEAT production model: the air-vents in the third pillar just above the rear wheel arch were likely indicating the presence of the rear-mounted engine in NSU's donor design. In fact though SEAT's engineers first examined the possibility to keep the rear-engine layout in the SEAT 1200 Sport, they made the final choice in favor of a front-engined one.
