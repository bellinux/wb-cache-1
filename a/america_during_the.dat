5|$|Kirkland, Cifelli, {{and colleagues}} {{noted that the}} fauna of the Mussentuchit – iguanodonts, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians – bears strong {{similarities}} to contemporary Asian faunas. They proposed that Eolambia {{was part of an}} influx of Asian dinosaurs into North <b>America</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Cenomanian, which supplanted the earlier low-diversity native fauna. This hypothesis is supported by the close relationship between Eolambia and either Probactrosaurus or Fukuisaurus, which have respectively been recovered by the phylogenies of Head and Sues & Averianov.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Kingston Peak resembles {{glacial till}} by being poorly sorted {{and other parts}} have large boulder-sized dropstones resting in a {{fine-grained}} matrix of sandstone and siltstone. Similar deposits are found over North <b>America</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> same period, some 700 to 800 mya.

By the Pleistocene, ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Various {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the cause of Heinrich events, most of which imply instability of the massive Laurentide ice sheet, a continental glacier covering North <b>America</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> last glacial period.

5|$|Apatosaurus is a genus in {{the family}} Diplodocidae. It {{is one of the}} more basal genera, with only Amphicoelias and {{possibly}} a new, unnamed genus more primitive. While the subfamily Apatosaurinae was named in 1929, the group was not used validly until an extensive 2015 study. Only Brontosaurus is also in the subfamily, with the other genera being considered synonyms or reclassified as diplodocines. Brontosaurus has long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its only species was reclassified as A.excelsus in 1903. A 2015 study concluded that Brontosaurus is a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus, but not all paleontologists agree with this division. As it existed in North <b>America</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> late Jurassic, Apatosaurus would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Stegosaurus.|$|E
