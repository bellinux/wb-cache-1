5|$|The Sunday Times is a British {{national}} broadsheet newspaper, the Sunday sister {{paper of}} The Times. In 1968, under {{the ownership of}} Lord Thomson, The Sunday Times {{had been involved in}} a deal to purchase the Mussolini diaries for an <b>agreed</b> final <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of £250,000, although they had only paid out an initial amount of £60,000. These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. Trevor-Roper—who was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979—was a specialist on Nazi Germany, who had worked for the British Intelligence Services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the Führer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject. He subsequently wrote about the Nazis in Hitler's War Directives (1964) and Hitler's Place in History (1965).|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of low income housing subsidy programs currently operating in Chile. The use of detailed microdata allows a close assessment {{of the relationship between}} individual subsidy grants, characteristics of the units purchased and actual transaction prices. The study entails both the comparison between programs with different incentive frameworks, and the relative performance of each of these programs in a context of major increases in the levels of assistance provided. The evidence suggests that in most cases virtually the entire increase in the subsidy to the purchaser, which is intended to make housing more affordable, is translated into increased housing prices. In fact, in subsidized transactions between 2007 and 2009 the <b>agreed</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>prices</b> were almost entirely determined by the maximum subsidy amounts set by the housing authority. This occurred repeatedly in transactions performed through programs where the granted subsidy was virtually a 1 to 1 function of the agreed transaction price and where subsidy beneficiaries have little or no incentive to bargain. In such a framework, all the increases in subsidy levels that occurred in the period were translated into equivalent increases in prices with very limited improvements in the quality and location of the units purchased. On the contrary, prices tended to move much more closely with the unit's predicted price (determined by its actual characteristics) in less generous programs that provide lump sum transfers and where beneficiaries are responsible for paying larger proportions of the balance. However, even in these cases, up to 64 cents per dollar of housing subsidy are estimated to be translated directly into house price inflation. The estimated positive impact of subsidy amounts on prices of existing units is a form of wealth transfer that benefits current owners. Although the majority of today's sellers in this segment are low to middle income households that benefited from housing policy efforts in previous decades, these owners are certainly wealthier than current subsidy beneficiaries and also wealthier than other households still waiting to receive housing assistance. Such wealth transfers may be inappropriate, and undermine the declared goal of targeting housing assistance efforts on those who need it most. by Slaven Antonio Razmilic Burgos. Thesis (M. C. P.)

In the article, with the help of mathematical methods we examine the conditions of mutually beneficial economic relations between agricultural producers and processing enterprises. Mathematical model for estimating the profits of the company is built of the following conditions: producers sell processing plants raw materials, determined by the coefficient of the interest in the partnership at an <b>agreed</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price,</b> and the remaining raw materials are processed, so they can sell their products independently.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{barriers to}} {{production of the}} organic milk. There was conducted a survey among conventional producers of cow’s milk. Based on the identified barriers to organic milk production and farmers’ opinions on them there were identified the most important barriers. The most important barrier {{to the production of}} organic milk in Vysočina region is considered to be the lack of price premiums for organic milk produced. The price premium is currently around 0. 40 CZK per litre of organic milk. Farmers require a minimum price premium 1 CZK per litre, respectively 30 [*]% increase of the price of milk. The higher price premium may serve as a motivation, which could eliminate the second major barrier - satisfaction with the current production. Problematic contact with suppliers has been identified as the third most important barrier by surveyed firms. Buyers do not respect the <b>agreed</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> (premium price). Partial barrier to organic milk production, according to surveyed farmers is the lack of the necessary amount of concentrated feed in the quality of organic milk...|$|E
50|$|In 2004, many of MGM's {{competitors}} {{started to}} make bids to purchase the studio, beginning with Time Warner. It was not unexpected that Time Warner would bid, since the largest shareholder in the company was Ted Turner. His Turner Entertainment Group had risen to success in part through its ownership of the pre-May 1986 MGM library. After {{a short period of}} negotiation with MGM, Time Warner was unsuccessful. The leading bidder proved to be Sony Corporation of America, backed by Comcast and private equity firms Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital, L.P.), DLJ and Providence Equity Partners. Sony's primary goal was to ensure Blu-ray Disc support at MGM; cost synergies with Sony Pictures Entertainment were secondary. Time Warner made a counter-bid (which Ted Turner reportedly tried to block), but on September 13, 2004, Sony increased its bid of US$11.25/share (roughly $4.7 billion) to $12/share ($5 billion), and Time Warner subsequently withdrew its bid of $11/share ($4.5 billion). MGM and Sony <b>agreed</b> on a <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of nearly $5 billion, of which about $2 billion was to pay off MGM debt.

40|$|An {{agreement}} {{for the sale}} and purchase of real property often begins with an option to purchase (2 ̆ 2 OTP 2 ̆ 2). Usually, upon <b>agreeing</b> on the <b>purchase</b> <b>price,</b> the vendor will grant the purchaser an OTP in return for an option fee. During the specified option period, the vendor is bound to keep the property for the purchaser. This affords the purchaser an opportunity to reconsider his or her decision to purchase the property and time to source for financing for the purchase. If the purchaser decides {{to proceed with the}} purchase, he or she will exercise the OTP by the prescribed method and within the option period, upon which the vendor is obliged to complete the transaction. In Woo Kah Wai v Chew Ai Hua Sandra [2014] 4 SLR 166, the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the vendors were contractually obliged to grant an OTP containing terms demanded by the purchaser in the first place. To determine whether a contract to this effect has arisen, it is necessary to examine the method by which the OTP was sought to be procured. This case provides the opportunity to consider how basic principles of contract formation apply in the process of procuring an OTP, and also how subtle legal distinctions between the different methods of procuring an OTP have bearing on practical matters...|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, the Tate Gallery paid 8 {{million pounds}} back to various {{insurers}} at Lloyd's of London including Hiscox and other London based underwriters {{to ensure that}} they retained title of ownership in the paintings should they ever resurface and to meet the terms of the Turner Bequest. Tate had previously received 24 million pounds from insurers as a settlement for the claim for the theft but was unable to use this money as it may have been deemed that Tate had 'sold' the works to insurers. Sir Nicholas Serota, director of Tate, after having received the green light from his supervisory board and justice officials, went ahead with a secret plan to buy back the paintings, known as [...] "Operation Cobalt". An undercover agent from Scotland Yard contacted Edgar Liebrucks, and in late 1999 the lawyer began to negotiate with the Mafia on behalf of Tate. The two sides <b>agreed</b> on a <b>purchase</b> <b>price</b> of 5 million Deutsche Marks per painting. Stevo again increased the demanded advance payment from 1 million to 2 million Marks, and Liebrucks took out a personal loan to cover this payment. The deal for the first painting went through, Liebrucks received about 320,000 euros as compensation by Tate, and Shade and Darkness returned to London in July 2000. Further negotiations then halted; Stevo apparently had lost interest.|$|R
