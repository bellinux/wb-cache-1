40|$|A new {{architecture}} of field {{programmable gate array}} for high-speed datapath applications is presented. Its implementation is facilitated by a configurable interconnect technology based on a onetime, two-terminal programmable, very low-impedance <b>anti-fuse</b> and by a configurable logic module optimized for datapath applications. The configurable logic module can effectively implement diverse logic functions including sequential elements such as latches and flip-flops, and arithmetic functions such as one-bit full adder and two-bit comparator. A novel programming architecture is designed for supplying large current through the <b>anti-fuse</b> element, which drops the on-resistance of <b>anti-fuse</b> below 20 #. The chip has been fabricated using a 0. 8 -#m n-well complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology with two layers of metalization. 22 Hanjin Cho et al.

40|$|This {{presentation}} compares and contrasts {{the effectiveness}} and the system/designer {{impacts of the}} two main approaches to upset hardening: the Actel approach (RTSX-S and RTAX-S) of low-level (inside each flip-flop) triplication and the Xilinx approach (Virtex and Virtex 2) of design-level triplication of both functional blocks and voters. The effectiveness of these approaches is compared using measurements made in conjunction {{with each of the}} FPGAs' manufacturer: for Actel, published data [1] and for Xilinx, recent results from the Xilinx SEE Test Consortium (note that the author is an active and founding member). The impacts involve Actel advantages in the areas of transistor-utilization efficiency and minimizing designer involvement in the triplication while the Xilinx advantages relate to the ability to custom tailor upset hardness and the flexibility of re-configurability. Additionally, there are currently clear Xilinx advantages in available features such as the number of I/O's, logic cells, and RAM blocks as well as speed. However, the advantage of the Actel <b>anti-fuses</b> for configuration over the Xilinx SRAM cells is that the latter need additional functionality and external circuitry (PROMs and, at least a watchdog timer) for configuration and configuration scrubbing. Further, although effectively mitigated if done correctly, the proton upset-ability of the Xilinx FPGAs is a concern in severe proton-rich environments. Ultimately, both manufacturers' upset hardening is limited by SEFI (single-event functional interrupt) rates where it appears the Actel results are better although the Xilinx Virtex 2 -family result of about one SEFI in 65 device-years in solar-min GCR (the more intense part of the galactic cosmic-ray background) should be acceptable to most mission...|$|R

Because this technology spans design and manufacturing, elements of design, layout, processing, and testing are included. The mechanism is defined and typical applications are discussed. Layout considerations of <b>anti-fuse</b> devices are summarized and complex trim networks and multiplexed control methods are presented. Both bipolar and CMOS process implementations are considered.

40|$|<b>Anti-fuse</b> devices {{based on}} {{non-volatile}} memory cells and suitable for power electronic applications are demonstrated {{for the first}} time using silicon technology. These devices may be applied as stand alone devices or integrated using standard junction-isolation into application-specific and smart-power integrated circuits. The on-resistance of such devices can be permanently switched by nine orders of magnitude by triggering the <b>anti-fuse</b> with a positive voltage pulse. Extrapolation of measurement data and 2 D TCAD process and device simulations indicate that 20 A anti-fuses with 10 m Omega can be reliably fabricated in 0. 35 mu m technology with a footprint of 2. 5 mm(2). Moreover, this concept offers distinguished added-values compared to existing mechanical relays, e. g. pre-test, temporary and permanent reset functions, gradual turn-on mode, non-volatility, and extendibility to high voltage capability...|$|E

The selection of <b>anti-fuse</b> (AF) elements is discussed. The high voltage (HV) reliability issue for AF arrays is investigated and a high voltage switch drawing zero DC current is developed to tolerate the high voltages required for programming. Various AF memory cells and the HV switch were fabricated in standard TSMC 0. 18 mu m process. The breakdown of the AFs has been characterized and the functionality of the HV switch has been verified by measurement...|$|E
40|$|Non-volatile {{memories}} (NVMs) {{are essential}} {{for a variety of}} embedded applications such as encryption keys, code storage, and analog trimming. One of the lowest-cost non-volatile memories is the one-time programmable (OTP) memory. Most of the existing OTP memories are fabricated with special processes where extra masks are added to a standard CMOS process. It is, however, still necessary to develop an OTP memory in a pure CMOS process to further reduce the cost for many applications such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Different from conventional OTP memory designs, the targeted embedded applications in this work require ultra-low power consumption in both the read and the write operations. Because of that, power reduction strategies are provided during memory cell and circuit designs. Owing to the need for high voltages during write operations, gate-oxide reliability is also a major concern. To solve all the high voltage problems in the memory circuit, the Cascode technique is used extensively to maintain programming reliability. Various <b>anti-fuse</b> memory elements manufactured with a standard 0. 18 μm CMOS process from a major foundry are compared and the gate-oxide <b>anti-fuse</b> (GOAF) is chosen as the most suitable one when programming current is seriously constrained. Different combinations of GOAF memory cells have been fabricated, measured, and studied. A complete GOAF OTP memory circuit has been designed and fabricated with the above process. The functions of each part are described and measurement results are shown and analyzed in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{synthesis}} flow for <b>anti-fuse</b> based FPGAs with multiple-output logic cells. The flow {{consists of two}} steps: mapping and packing. The mapper finds mapping solutions using a dynamic programming-based approach that finds the best match at each node of the decomposed target circuit. After this mapping step is completed, the resulting netlist of cells is optimally packed into net list of logic cells by using a multi-dimensional coin change problem formulation which is again solved by a dynamic programming based approach. Experimental results for Quicklogic's pASIC 3 logic family are provided to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed mapping and packing techniques...|$|E
40|$|The Actel 1020 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a {{low power}} CMOS device {{equivalent}} to 2000 logic gates.

In the Barnes Dual Cone Scanner Earth Horizon Sensor, {{it has been used}} (with an A/D converter) to autonomously sample radiance data and store it in pseudo-dual port memory. The Actel chip is also used to control bus access to the memory.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} a level- 1 trigger logic in an efficient manner from timing and space consumption point of view, application specific IC chips (ASIC) as well as FPGA ones are vitally used in the ATLAS muon end-cap level- 1 trigger system. Various subsidiary logics are implemented in FPGAs while the core trigger logic is implemented in ASICs. These components will suffer for ten years the radiation of approximately 100 Gy of total ionizing dose (TID) and a hadron fluence of 2 x 10 ^ 10 hadrons/cm^ 2, which will cause single event upset (SEU) or single event latch up (SEL). We intend to use Rohm 0. 35 um gate width CMOS technology for ASIC and Actel <b>anti-fuse</b> based FPGA.

40|$|The program {{consistency}} of high density gate-oxide <b>anti-fuse</b> PROM (programmable read only memory) memory cell is considered in this paper. To solve this problem, we do {{research on the}} mechanism and models of gate-oxide break down. A test chip based on 2 T memory cell is also designed for the experiment. During the test, {{we have found that}} the program {{consistency of}} 2 T cell is really pessimistic. What’s more, the program voltage has effect on the consistency. Through research and test, we have got the optimal program voltage- 6. 5 V for 2 T memory cell in 180 nm technology. To further improve the consistency, we modify the 2 T memory cell and propose a 3 T memory cell. It consumes 18 % more area, but the standard deviation of equivalent resistance decreases 15. 3 % in the worst situation. The deviation can decrease 80. 3 % at most. The program consistency is greatly improved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} harvest {{energy from the}} {{environment}} {{in order to provide}} a source of power for devices that are inaccessible and cannot rely solely on batteries is becoming an important characteristic for many sensor and health monitoring applications. Energy harvesters come in many forms, a common approach of which is to utilise environmental vibrations to generate power through the actions of the piezoelectric effect. The power generated from such devices is highly dependent upon the coupling both to the mechanical source and the electrical load of the system. Unfortunately damage to such energy harvesting devices can lead to a loss of coupling in both mechanical and electrical systems. This paper investigates an approach to ‘self-heal’ the response of an energy harvesting system once damage has occurred through the use of an <b>anti-fuse</b> array of ‘passive’ components to effectively re-couple the electrical load to match more efficiently and regain some loss of power generation after damage. This is first demonstrated through modelling and simulation within two state-of-the-art applications, SPICE and COMSOL and then later built into a real-world demonstrator...|$|E
40|$|The ATLAS end-cap muon level- 1 trigger {{system is}} divided into three parts; one off-detector part and two on-detector parts. Application {{specific}} IC (ASIC) and <b>anti-fuse</b> FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) are actively used in on-detector parts. Data transfer with Low-Voltage Data Signaling serial link (LVDS link) is used between two on-detector parts (15 m apart) and G-Link (Hewlett-Packard 1. 4 Gbaud high speed data link) with optical transmission(90 m) is used from one of the on-detector parts to the off-detector part. These components will suffer for ten years the radiation of approximately 200 Gy of total ionizing dose (TID) and a hadron fluence of 2 x 10 ^ 10 hadrons/c^m 2. We have investigated systematically the radiation susceptibility to both total ionizing dose and single event effects for ASIC, FPGA, and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) serializer and deserializer chipsets for LVDS (two candidates) and G-Link (one) together. In this presentation we report the result of irradiation tests for these devices and discuss validity of them to use in the system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For <b>anti-fuse</b> or flash-memory-based field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), single-event {{transient}} (SET) -induced faults {{are significantly}} more pronounced than single-event upsets (SEUs). While most existing work studies SEU, this paper proposes a retiming algorithm for mitigating variational SETs (i. e., SETs with different durations and strengths). Considering the reshaping effect of an SET pulse caused by broadening and attenuation during its propagation, SET-aware retiming (SaR) redistributes combinational paths via postlayout retiming and minimizes {{the possibility that}} an SET pulse is latched. The SaR problem is formulated as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solved efficiently by a progressive ILP approach. In contrast to existing SET-mitigation techniques, the proposed SaR {{does not change the}} FPGA architecture or the layout of an FPGA application. Instead, it reconfigures the connection between a flip-flop and an LUT within a programmable logic block. Experimental results show that SaR increases mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) by 78 % for variational SETs with a 10 -min runtime limit while preserving the clock frequency on ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first in-depth study on FPGA retiming for SET mitigation. Index Terms—Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), retiming, single-event transients.

40|$|In this paper, an {{overcurrent}} protection {{system is designed}} {{to ensure the safety}} of the gyrotrons in the EAST ECRH system. Two {{overcurrent protection}} systems were established, a fast one and a slow one. The fast one uses the current transformers as the current sensors. The models of the current transformers and the superconducting magnet were built to analyze the effect of the environmental magnetic field on the current transformers using FI method. The analysis results show that the magnetic induction at the position near the current transformers must less than 0. 002 T, i. e., the current transformers should be placed at a distance greater than 2. 2 meters from the magnet center to ensure its normal work. The slow one uses the shunt to monitor the currents. An <b>anti-fuse</b> FPGA and a timer is used to realize the signal processing in the fast protection circuit and the slow protection circuit respectively. The response time of the fast protection circuit is less than 100 ns, and the response time of the slow protection circuit is less than 31 μs. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) cannot be changed {{once it has}} been produced or 'taped-out', on the other hand, a processor allows more flexibility by providing an ISA(Instruction-Set Architecture) and allowing programs to change sequences of instructions {{within the confines of}} a memory consistency model. Software allows increased flexibility as it can be written in a High-level language and compiled into a processor ISA instruction sequence. An FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array) so called because it can be programmed in-situ lies `in between' hardware and software. The intent of an FPGA design is to provide a designer with the flexibility of software at hardware speeds. FPGAs have been developed with <b>anti-fuse</b> technology(one-time programming) but the most popular are SRAM-based versions that may be programmed an infinite number of times. The notion of Reconfigurable Computing in this paper is related to FPGA architectures(which may be standalone) and also to architectures that use FPGAs as one of their components. The {{capabilities of}} a system are significantly enhanced when a heterogeneous architecture comprised of different components and FPGAs are used in an integrated fashion. FPGAs have been popular for logic prototyping, logic emulation and `glue logic' and are being increasingly used for hardware acceleration of application-specific computations not limited to image processing kernels and video streams. Rapid prototyping and their use as a cheap ASIC replacement are allowing penetration into newer market segments...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of highly miniaturized electronic and mechanical systems will {{be accompanied by}} new problems and issues regarding the radiation response of these systems in the space environment. In this {{paper we discuss some}} of the more prominent radiation problems brought about by miniaturization. For example, autonomous micro-spacecraft will require large amounts of high density memory, most likely in the form of stacked, multichip modules of DRAM's, that must tolerate the radiation environment. However, advanced DRAM's (16 to 256 Mbit) are quite susceptible to radiation, particularly single event effects, and even exhibit new radiation phenomena that were not a problem for older, less dense memory chips. Another important trend in micro-spacecraft electronics is toward the use of low-voltage microelectronic systems that consume less power. However, the reduction in operating voltage also caries with it an increased susceptibility to radiation. In the case of application specific integrated microcircuits (ASIM's), advanced devices of this type, such as high density field programmable gate arrays (FPGA's) exhibit new single event effects (SEE), such as single particle reprogramming of <b>anti-fuse</b> links. New advanced bipolar circuits have been shown recently to degrade more rapidly in the low dose rate space environment than in the typical laboratory total dose radiation test used to qualify such devices. Thus total dose testing of these parts is no longer an appropriately conservative measure to be used for hardness assurance. We also note that the functionality of micromechanical Si-based devices may be altered due to the radiation-induced deposition of charge in the oxide passivation layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{allows a}} {{field-programmable gate array}} (FPGA) or similar device to be efficiently reconfigured {{in whole or in}} part to provide higher capacity, non-redundant operation. The redundant device consists of functional units such as adders or multipliers, configuration memory for the functional units, a programmable routing method, configuration memory for the routing method, and various other features such as block RAM, I/O (random access memory, input/output) capability, dedicated carry logic, etc. The redundant device has three identical sets of functional units and routing resources and majority voters that correct errors. The configuration memory may or may not be redundant, depending on need. For example, SRAM-based FPGAs will need some type of radiation-tolerant configuration memory, or they will need triple-redundant configuration memory. Flash or <b>anti-fuse</b> devices will generally not need redundant configuration memory. Some means of loading and verifying the configuration memory is also required. These are all components of the pre-existing redundant FPGA. This innovation modifies the voter to accept a MODE input, which specifies whether ordinary voting is to occur, or if redundancy is to be split. Generally, additional routing resources will also be required to pass data between sections of the device created by splitting the redundancy. In redundancy mode, the voters produce an output corresponding to the two inputs that agree, in the usual fashion. In the split mode, the voters select just one input and convey this to the output, ignoring the other inputs. In a dual-redundant system (as opposed to triple-redundant), instead of a voter, there is some means to latch or gate a state update only when both inputs agree. In this case, the invention would require modification of the latch or gate so that it would operate normally in redundant mode, and would separately latch or gate the inputs in non-redundant mode...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2013. Major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Chris H. Kim. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xx, 129 pages. An on-chip embedded NVM (eNVM) enables a zero-standby power system-on-a-chip {{with a smaller}} form factor, faster access speed, lower access power, and higher security than an off-chip NVM. Differently from the high density eNVM technologies such as dual-poly eflash, FeRAM, STT-MRAM, and RRAM that typically require process overhead beyond standard logic process, the moderate density eNVM technologies such as e-fuse, <b>anti-fuse,</b> and single-poly embedded flash (eflash) can be fabricated in a standard logic process with no process overhead. Among them, a single-poly eflash is a unique multiple-time programmable moderate density eNVM, while {{it is expected to}} {{play a key role in}} mitigating variability and reliability issues of the future VLSI technologies; however, the challenges such as a high voltage disturbance, an implementation of logic compatible High Voltage Switch (HVS), and a limited sensing margin are required to be solved for its implementation using a standard I/O device. This thesis focuses on alleviating such challenges of the single-poly eflash memory with three single-poly eflash designs proposed in a generic logic process for moderate density eNVM applications. Firstly, the proposed 5 T eflash features a WL-by-WL accessible architecture with no disturbance issue of the unselected WL cells, an overstress-free multi-story HVS expanding the cell sensing margin, and a selective WL refresh scheme for the higher cell endurance. The most favorable eflash cell configuration is also studied when the performance, endurance, retention, and disturbance characteristics are all considered. Secondly, the proposed 6 T eflash features the bit-by-bit re-write capability for the higher overall cell endurance, while not disturbing the unselected WL cells. The logic compatible on-chip charge pump to provide the appropriate high voltages for the proposed eflash operations is also discussed. Finally, the proposed 10 T eflash features a multi-configurable HVS that does not require the boosted read supplies, and a differential cell architecture with improved retention time. All these proposed eflash memories were implemented in a 65 nm standard logic process, and the test chip measurement results confirmed the functionality of the proposed designs with a reasonable retention margin, showing the competitiveness of the proposed eflash memories compared to the other moderate density eNVM candidates...|$|E
