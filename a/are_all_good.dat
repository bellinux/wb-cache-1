Six60, Julian Temple Band, Two Cartoons, Males, Summer Thieves and Albion Place <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> examples of Dunedin bands to have received national and international acclaim in recent years.|$|E
500|$|In 2012 a third [...] "stem aetosaur" [...] was {{described}} from the Middle Triassic Manda Beds of Tanzania. It differs from other Middle Triassic pseudosuchians {{in having a}} long skull, a small antorbital fenestra that fits into a large antorbital fossa {{in front of the}} eye socket, sharp and curved teeth, and osteoderms covering much of its body. Like aetosaurs and Revueltosaurus, it has a maxilla that fits into the jugal. Revueltosaurus, Turfanosuchus, and the unnamed Tanzanian pseudosuchian <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> fits for the hypothesized ancestor of aetosaurs because they both have double rows of leaf-shaped osteoderms along their backs that could potentially have evolved into the tightly fitting paramedian osteoderms of aetosaurs.|$|E

Punshon of The Guardian {{reviewed}} the {{collection in the}} 9 April 1937 issue when he wrote that it was [...] "perhaps {{enough to say that}} they <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good,</b> but not outstanding, Christie, and that in all of them Monsieur Poirot… is given full opportunity to display his accustomed acumen." [...] Punshon stated that the title story was, [...] "the best, and Mrs Christie is least successful when she enters into the international spy field. The last story is disappointing in that it presents an interesting psychological situation that seems to cry aloud for the fuller treatment. Mrs Christie could well have given it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a single-action revolver, {{the hammer}} is {{manually}} cocked, usually with the thumb of the firing or supporting hand. This action advances the cylinder {{to the next}} round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called [...] "single-action" [...] because the trigger only performs a single action, of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> examples of this system.|$|E
2500|$|Dual-action or {{double-action}} airbrushes {{enable the}} simultaneous adjustment of both air and color at the trigger, {{by allowing the}} user to actuate air by depressing the trigger and simultaneously adjust color by sliding the trigger back and forth. [...] This ability to adjust color flow while spraying the airbrush, coupled with the users adjustment of distance from the sprayed surface allows for the variation of fine to wide lines without stopping to re-adjust the spray pattern as is necessary with a single-action airbrush. [...] This allows for greater spray control and enables {{a wider variety of}} artistic effects. [...] This type of airbrush requires some amount of practice to become proficient in triggering technique and control, but it offers greater artistic versatility to the artists once the triggering technique is learned. Dual-action airbrushes (Badger Patriot 105, Paasche VL, Iwata CM-C <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> examples of dual-action airbrushes) are of a more sophisticated design model than single-action airbrushes, which tends to make them the more expensive of the two.|$|E

60|$|We sat {{up for a}} long while, and the Doctor brewed some gin-punch later on, for a change, though I {{could not}} taste much {{difference}} myself. But it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>good,</b> and we <b>were</b> very happy--everybody was so kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "This may <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> philosophy, Mr. Ratcliffe," [...] {{answered}} Miss Vere; [...] "but, excuse me, it by {{no means}} emboldens me to visit, at this late hour, a person whose extravagance of imagination you yourself can only palliate." ...|$|R

60|$|But {{they had}} always been very {{friendly}} with Mrs. Cliff, and they were glad {{to come to her}} dinner. The other guests <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> people, and a dinner-party of more distinction could not have been collected in that town.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, what of it?" [...] flashed Pan, {{suddenly}} gripped {{again by}} that strange cold emotion {{in the depths}} of him. [...] "I should think you'd be glad. Reckon it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> practice for what I'll have to do out here." ...|$|R
60|$|Snowballs {{were now}} flying in all directions, {{and it was}} quite {{probable}} that in the excitement many of the students let fly at their friends instead of at the enemy; but it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>good,</b> clean sport, and everybody enjoyed it greatly.|$|R

60|$|The other {{officers}} were now called in, and the commandant {{told them the}} news that he had received from the Warreners. There was a look of disappointment for a moment, and then cheering answers that they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> for another month's fighting were made.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, those <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>good</b> points, mother," [...] {{said the}} girl; [...] "and {{if you keep}} saying them over, and count a hundred every time before you speak, I guess you'll worry through." ...|$|E
