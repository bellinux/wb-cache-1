5|$|Adding <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> any row {{to another}} row, or <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> any column to another column, {{does not change}} the {{determinant}}. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E
5|$|Prefixes {{are added}} to unit names to produce {{multiple}} and sub-multiples of the original unit. All multiples are integer powers of ten, and above a hundred or below a hundredth all are integer powers of a thousand. For example, kilo- denotes <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> a thousand and milli- denotes <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> a thousandth, so there are one thousand millimetres to the metre and one thousand metres to the kilometre. The prefixes are never combined, so for example a millionth of a metre is a micrometre, not a millimillimetre. Multiples of the kilogram are named as if the gram were the base unit, so a millionth of a kilogram is a milligram, not a microkilogram.|$|E
5|$|Write {{amplification}} (WA) is an undesirable phenomenon {{associated with}} flash memory and solid-state drives (SSDs) where the actual {{amount of information}} physically written to the storage media is <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> the logical amount intended to be written.|$|E
50|$|In {{the cases}} below where 2 is <b>an</b> exponent, <b>multiples</b> <b>of</b> 2 are also proven, since a {{power can be}} squared. Similarly, where n is <b>an</b> exponent, <b>multiples</b> <b>of</b> n are also proven.|$|R

40|$|We connect {{two aspects}} of graph drawing, namely angular resolution, and the {{possibility}} to draw with all angles <b>an</b> integer <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> 2 π/d. <b>A</b> planar graph with angular resolution at least π/ 2 canbedrawnwith all angles <b>an</b> integer <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> π/ 2 (rectilinear). For d � = 4,d> 2, an angular resolution of 2 π/d {{does not imply that}} the graph can be drawn with all angles <b>an</b> integer <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> 2 π/d. We argue that the exceptional situation for d = 4 is due to the absence of triangles in the rectangular grid...|$|R
5|$|It has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n = 34, which is unusual for the genus Drosera {{and closer to the}} diploid {{chromosome number}} of the Venus flytrap (Dionaeamuscipula), another member of the Droseraceae. Variable chromosome counts for Dionaea from multiple studies include 2n = 30, 32, and 33. Of the Drosera species with known chromosome counts, most are <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> x = 10. Based on an extensive review of karyotype studies, the botanist Fernando Rivadavia suggested that the base chromosome number for the genus could be 2n = 20, a number that many Drosera species share including the widespread D.rotundifolia. Exceptions to this base number include the Australian, New Zealand and Southeast Asian Drosera, which have chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 6 to 64.|$|E
5|$|Under the Scotland Act 1998, {{ordinary}} {{general elections}} for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May every four years (1999, 2003, 2007 and so on). The date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the Monarch on the proposal of the Presiding Officer. If the Parliament itself resolves {{that it should be}} dissolved (with at least two-thirds of the Members voting in favour), or if the Parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be First Minister within 28 days of a General Election or of the position becoming vacant, the Presiding Officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the Parliament is dissolved by the Queen by royal proclamation. Extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections, unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election, in which case they supplant it. The following ordinary election reverts to the first Thursday in May, <b>a</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>of</b> four years after 1999 (i.e., 5 May 2011, 7 May 2015, etc.).|$|E
