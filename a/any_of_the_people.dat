5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the woman who would later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E
25|$|The Empusae were a {{class of}} supernatural demons that Lamia {{was said to have}} birthed. Hecate would often send them against travelers. They {{consumed}} or scared to death <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> where they inhabited. They bear many similarities to lilim. It has been suggested that later medieval lore of the succubi or lilim is derived from this myth.|$|E
25|$|Mordor {{has three}} {{enormous}} mountain ranges surrounding it, from the north, {{from the west}} and from the south. The mountains both protected the land from an unexpected invasion by <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> living in those directions and kept those living in Mordor from escaping. Tolkien {{was reported to have}} identified Mordor with the volcano of Stromboli off Sicily, in terms of geographic equivalency with the real world.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{or perhaps}} because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something wrong about the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2007, a Leflore County grand jury, {{composed}} {{primarily of}} black jurors and empaneled by Joyce Chiles, a black prosecutor, found no credible basis for Beauchamp's claim that 14 people {{took part in}} Till's abduction and murder. Beauchamp was angry with the finding. David Beito and Juan Williams, {{who worked on the}} reading materials for the Eyes on the Prize documentary, were critical of Beauchamp for trying to revise history and taking attention away from other cold cases. The grand jury failed to find sufficient cause for charges against Carolyn Bryant Donham. [...] Neither the FBI nor the grand jury found any credible evidence that Henry Lee Loggins, identified by Beauchamp as a suspect who could be charged, had any role in the crime. Other than Loggins, Beauchamp refused to name <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> he alleged were involved.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value on <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not nice people. When {{we decided that we}} hated each other, the company and me, {{one of the things the}} company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing." [...] Dale and the company (Grundy Television) parted on [...] "bad terms".|$|E
500|$|At 14:17 local time, a {{red flag}} was shown to {{indicate}} the race was stopped and FIA race doctor Sid Watkins arrived at the scene to treat Senna. When a race is stopped under {{a red flag}}, cars must slow down and make {{their way back to}} the pit lane or starting grid unless notified of a restart. This protects race marshals and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the Larrousse team mistakenly allowed one of their drivers, Érik Comas, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically waved him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at [...] "pretty much full speed". Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as [...] "the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life". Comas avoided hitting <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race.|$|E
500|$|The large {{collection}} of spoons includes 51 cochlearia, which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long, tapering handles with a pointed end {{which was used}} to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table. There are 23 cigni, which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the alpha and omega in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As {{is often the case}} with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is [...] "Aurelius Ursicinus", which occurs on a set of five cochlearia and five ladles. It is unknown whether <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive {{at the time it was}} buried.|$|E

One such threat, reported in The New Yorker, proposed that: [...] "Next time she shows up at a conference we... give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal... a good solid injury to the knees. I'd say a brain damage, but we don't want to make it so she ends up too retarded to fear us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, {{and felt}} lonely {{and out of}} place there. The young Chamberlain was [...] "a {{compulsive}} dreamer", {{more interested in the}} arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self. Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: [...] "The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is the only word which describes my feelings – than <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship". During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of [...] "Merry Old England", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.|$|E
