In this article, a method is presented to protect the m-aminophenol by converting it into a triarylimine group. This protected m-aminophenol was used together with 4 -fluoro, 4 '-hydroxybenzophenone in a typical poly(aryl ether) synthesis. PEKs of different molecular weights were synthesized with number average molecular weights M(n)) of 2600, 4500, and 5400 g/mol.

This {{is shown in the}} thermal dependence of the isochronous torsion modulus of a liquid polybutadiene selectively end-capped by a piperazine unit at both extremities. A rubbery plateau emerges when the telechelic polymer is coordinated to copper(I 1) or iron(II 1) chlorides. The rubbery plateau extends over a temperature range that depends on the molar ratio of the transition metal to the <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>group.</b> Similar observations have been reported when the dynamic mechanical properties of an a,w-bis(dimethylamino) telechelic polyisoprene have been investigated over the full range of temperature from the glassy plateau to the viscous flow. Upon complexation of the end groups, a rubberlike plateau is observed, which does not exist for the uncomplexed polymer. Furthermore, a secondary relaxation, attributed to the aggregation of the complexed amine end groups, occurs above Tg. The temperature at which the maximum of this relaxation is observed and the distribution of the relaxation times depend on the metal to amine endgroup molar ratio. At a ratio of 1, FeC 13 endows the chain network with higher cross-link density than CuC 12 does.

The versatility of this synthetic route allows tuning of the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the materials by means of the introduction of different electroactive peripheral groups. Two related star-shaped dyes have been prepared, one with amine and one with alkoxy end groups, and have been characterized using optical spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The energy levels of the dyes are found to lie within the band gap of a polyfluorene (PF) derivative such that energy transfer from the photoexcited PF to the dyes takes place. In OLEDs that contain 1 wt% of dye in PF, the emission is predominantly from the dye. Although the EL spectra are similar for the two dyes, other device characteristics differ greatly. OLEDs using the amine-terminated dye have a luminance that is a few orders of magnitude lower than that based on the alkoxy-terminated dye. The differences are explained by the positioning of the HOMO and LUMO levels of the two dyes compared to those of PF.

Particular attention was given to the influence of <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> on PA- 6 oxidation by studying samples that terminated predominantly in carboxylic, <b>amine</b> or methyl <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> The changes occurring in the oxidative stabilities and mechanisms of PA- 6 as a result of altering the <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of PA- 6 were investigated by a technique termed CL-DSC, which simultaneously measures the chemiluminescence (CL) and heat flow (DSC) from a sample. When <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were abundant in the PA- 6 sample a chemically induced electron exchange luminescence (CIEEL) mechanism could occur directly and the CL intensity was proportional to the heat flow curve of the DSC. However, when <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were absent it was the first derivative of the CL intensity that was proportional to the heat flow curve because the CIEEL mechanism could not operate until an easily oxidisable luminescent oxidation product was formed. Due to the dramatic effect <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> have on the oxidation mechanisms of PA- 6 it was hypothesized that <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> could be sites analogous to the impurities in polyolefins that lead to heterogeneous oxidation. To test this hypothesis, CL Imaging was used to map the occurrence and extent of oxidation across samples of PA- 6 to display the influence <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> have on the homogeneous or heterogeneous nature of PA- 6 oxidation. Sequences of FTIES spectra collected at specified time intervals during the in situ oxidation of PA- 6 samples terminating in the different <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> were turned into oxidation product profiles.

Four {{studies were carried out}} and new results relating to polyetheramine adsorption on clay, clay suspension structure and clay-stabilised emulsions are reported. Protonated amines are known to adsorb to clay due to charge interactions. However the adsorption of polymers with primary <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> at high pH has not previously been studied. We carry out the first such study on the adsorption of polyetheramines at a pH higher than the pKa of the amines. Our results reveal that the adsorption happens via an ion-exchange mechanism. In the adsorption process, the primary amine end-groups get protonated and release hydroxyl ions. The adsorbed molecules adopt a touching mushroom configuration. The effect of the polyetheramine adsorption on the suspension was initially observed due to the obvious change of suspension viscosity. At full coverage of the polyetherarnine, rheological data reveal that the sol/gel transition of the suspension is shifted from 3 wt% to 6 wt% clay. Using scattering techniques, large scale string-like structures are found in the bare clay suspensions, which subsequently disappear upon the addition of polyetheramine. This thesis also includes the study of clay particles at interfaces. Surface-modified clay particles are found to stabilise oil-in-water Pickering emulsions. The clay particles at the droplet surface are found to adopt an orientation parallel to the droplet surface, and there are on average four layers of clay particles at the interface. Using Pickering emulsions as a template, well-defined clay microcapsules were prepared by cross-linking the clay particles at the droplet surface. The conclusion on clay orientation is further substantiated by direct observation of the microcapsule surface using SEM. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how polymer [-] {{nanoparticle}} interactions influences structure, dynamics, and {{properties of}} composites is of fundamental importance {{for both the}} science and technology applications of organic [-] inorganic hybrid materials. Great {{attention has been given}} to changes organic polymer species undergo in forming polymer nanoparticle composites. This thesis focuses on a specific type of hybrid systems created by densely grafting polymer chains onto inorganic nanoparticles to form self-suspended nanoparticle suspensions in which every polymer chain is both anchored to and confined between the surfaces of neighboring particles. We have studied the hierarchical structure and relaxation dynamics of polymer chains in these self-suspended nanoparticle suspensions. We have investigated the conformations and thermo-physical properties of self-suspended suspensions based on polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains tethered to silica nanoparticles. It is found that the structure and crystallization of confined PEG could be very different depending on the length scale on which the structure is observed. Below the size of one hybrid unit, particle-tethered PEG chains form more stable conformations, whereas tethered PEG is more amorphous than free chains on length scales above one hybrid unit. We also report how tethering, crowding, and confinement by nanoparticles change the viscoelastic and dielectric relaxation dynamics of nanoparticle-tethered polymer chains. In this study, diverse molecular weights of cis- 1, 4 -Polyisoprene (PI), a type A dielectric polymer, is synthesized in the spectrum from unentangled to wellentangled regime with <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>group</b> functionality. By tethering this polymer to nanoparticles at varying grafting densities it is possible to study dynamics of polymer chains under confinement using bulk measurements. Global chain relaxation is conveniently explored since the net dipole moment of an entire chain of cis- 1, 4 -PI is parallel to the end-to-end vector of the tethered molecules. We have found that tethered PI chains exhibit slower relaxation dynamics and are stretched compared to free polymers. We have studied that nanoparticles could impose topological constraints to the tubes of tethered chains when short molecular weight chains are sparsely tethered. In addition, jamming of soft glasses with increasing temperature and decreasing grafting density have been observed from dielectric spectroscopy and rheology experiments. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|E

Immobilized primary amine groups of (,gamma -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APS) on silicon wafers initiated the ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides of glutamic acid esters (NCAs).

The average orientation of the helices ranging from 22 - 42 degrees with respect to the substrate within the first block to 31 - 35 degrees in the second block could be derived with FT-IR as well...|$|R

Polymerization of tert-butyl acrylate was first achieved by atom transfer radical polymerization using ethyl- 2 -bromoisobutyrate or paramethoxyphenyl- 2 -bromoisobutyrate as initiator.

The highest photoluminescence quantum yield (17 %) was achieved using N- 1 -(2 -aminoethyl) -N- 2 -[3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]- 1, 2 -ethanediamine as surface ligand. Transmission electron microscopy and powder x-ray diffraction showed highly crystalline materials with a ZnO nanoparticle diameter of about 4 nm. The cytotoxicity of the different siloxane-capped ZnO QDs towards growing Escherichia coli bacterial cells was evaluated in MOPS-minimal medium. Although concentrations of 5 mM in QDs caused a complete growth arrest in E. coli, siloxane-capped ZnO QDs appeared weakly toxic at lower doses (0. 5 or 1 mM). The concentration of bioavailable Zn 2 + ions leaked from ZnO QDs was evaluated using the biosensor bacteria Cupriavidus metallidurans AE 1433. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that concentrations of bioavailable Zn 2 + are too low to explain the inhibitory effects of the ZnO QDs against bacteria cells at 1 mM and that the siloxane shell prevents ZnO QDs from dissolution contrary to uncapped ZnO nanoparticles. Because of their low cytotoxicity, good biocompatibility, low cost and large number of functional <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups,</b> which makes them easy to tailor for end-user purposes, siloxane-capped ZnO QDs offer a high potential as fluorescent probes and as biosensors...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{carboxylic}} acid coated magnetite nanoparticles (CA-Fe 3 O 4 NPs) {{were applied to}} mechanically robust, Nylon 6 nanomembranes by three different techniques; 1) simultaneous electrospraying-electrospinning, 2) layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly, and 3) chemical grafting of NPs onto Nylon 6. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the NP treatment homogeneity by the three methods and examine the durability on the membranes for potential wastewater treatment applications. The carboxylic acid polymeric coating on the NPs facilitated loading by all methods to display differing chemical bonding pathways: hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and covalent bonding. Electrospinning the fibers while simultaneously electrospraying is a simple method to incorporate NPs within fibers independent of polymer-particle solvent compatibilities. LbL assembly can allow for the number of NP layers to be controlled. The grafting method can allow for the formation of a durable, covalent bond between the carboxylate groups of the NPs and <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> on Nylon 6. Main characterization techniques included electron microscopy, CIELAB spectrophotometry, and ICP-AES analysis. Results reveal that electrospinning-electrospraying and chemical grafting methods produced a homogeneous NP dispersion on the membranes. ICP-AES results indicate that the durability of the treatments is pH dependent and driven by electrostatic interactions. These surface treatment methods have not been previously attempted with Nylon 6 fibers and polymer coated Fe 3 O 4 NPs. Additionally, few studies evaluate the durability of NP treatments on fibers although it is an issue of high concern and the NP treatment should be long lasting for the intended end-use. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R

Considering the potential of cross-linking reactions during polycondensation processes because of the multifunctionality existing in each reacting species, it is remarkable that no gelation was observed for all of the in situ synthesis experiments conducted. The collective evidence based on the data from Soxhlet extraction (mass balance), elemental analysis, thermogravirnetric analysis, Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting materials implicates that, under our reaction conditions, most of the HPB-PEK (> 93 wt % estimated) was grafted to the surfaces of VGCNFs, resulting in the formation of highly coated nanofibers. The grafted (HPB-PEK) -g-VGCNF materials were practically insoluble in dichlorobenzene or toluene but showed distinctly improved solubility in polar solvents such as N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone, N,N-dimemylformaide, dimethylacetamide, and ethanol and even higher solubility in a ethanol/triethylamine mixture or in a 10 % aqueous ammonia solution, apparently promoted by the numerous peripheral CO 2 H groups. From the intrinsic viscosity data analysis, all (HPB-PEK) -gVGCNFs appeared to behave like an organic polymer in dilute solution and show rodlike character with increasingly shorter/smaller HPB-PEK grafts. As a way to determine both the ease in performing a chemical transformation {{on the periphery of the}} hyperbranched component of the resulting (HPB-PEK) -g-VGCNF and the end-group effect on some of their physical properties, the carboxylic acid <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> of the 10 wt % (HPB-PEK) -g-VGCNF were converted to benzothiazole, dodecyl ester, and <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups.</b> As an example of how these transformations alter the physical properties, the dodecyl-terminated nanocomposite displayed an excellent solubility in chloroform and a much lower Tg than the CO 2 H-terminated (HPB-PEK) -g-VGCNF. close 141...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Blends of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polyamide 6 (N 6) are interesting for both scientific studies and commercial exploitation. PVDF {{is known to be}} miscible with polymers produced from monomers containing carbonyl side groups, eg. polyethyl acrylate, polyacrylamide etc., but is not miscible with polymers containing carbonyl groups in the main chain, ego polyamides, polyester, etc. Although complete miscibility of the blend components is not always necessary, strong physical interactions between the two components are needed in order to obtain a compatible blend, i. e. one which exhibits good mechanical properties. An investigation was carried out to explore the possibility to compatibilise blends of PVDF and N 6 using y-radiation to graft acid groups on either polymer and subsequently ionomerizing these with zinc cations. Graft copolymer type of compatibilizer was produced when the acid functionalized PVDF (grafted PVDF) was blended with N 6 or acid functionalized N 6 (grafted N 6). Fourier transform infrared analysis has confirmed the occurance of reactions between acid groups in the grafted PVDFand amine groups in the N 6. The compatibility of the PVDF/N 6 blends was found to increase with increasing amount of carboxylic acid groups in the two polymers. This was accompanied by an increase in Tg of the N 6 phase in blend, which became more pronounced when both components were grafted. Tensile test and solvent resistance experiments were carried out to relate the compatibization of the blend to the improvement in mechanical properties. Ionomerization of the functionalized polymers with zinc cations was performed in order to study the effect on compatibility of the blend. The neutralization of the acid groups in either polymer in the blend by addition of zinc acetyl acetonate was found to suppress the chemical reaction with the <b>amine</b> <b>end</b> <b>groups</b> in the N 6 phase, and to cause a reduction in the T g and a reduction in crosslinking of the N 6 phase. However when both polymers were grafted, the crystallinity of the N 6 phase was restored, which was accompanied by an increase in Tg...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} block copolymers containing polyethylenimine (PEI) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) blocks, as well as biodegradable PEI derivatives were synthesized, and their potential as gene delivery vehicles were investigated with regard to DNA condensation, transfection efficiency and biocompatibility. Since this first study revealed that with increasing degree of PEGylation DNA condensation is impaired, a synthesis route was developed that exclusively led to PEG-block- PEI diblock copolymers where the degree of PEGylation did not exceed one. The new synthesis concept involved the ring-opening-polymerization of ethylenimine {{in the presence of}} a so called 'macrostopper', a PEG with a primary <b>amine</b> as <b>end</b> <b>group</b> allowing to terminate the polymerization reaction. Compact spherical and stable polymer/DNA complexes of about 100 nm size were obtained with these diblock copolymers. The DNA condensation potential of low MW PEIs was significantly enhanced when they were coupled to a larger unit by multi-star-PEGs using HMDI as linker. The resulting 4 - and 8 -star-(PEG-block-PEI) copolymers yielded small (100 nm) and stable polymer/DNA complexes. EtBr could no longer intercalate into the DNA within these complexes, thus, the DNA was properly condensed by these star-block copolymers. Biodegradable PEIs was synthesized by connecting several low MW PEIs to larger units using oligo(L-lactic acid-co-succinic acid) s. As a result, the PEI macromolecules were conjugated by succinamide units to the copolymer poly(ethylenimine-co-L-lactamide-cosuccinamid) [P(EI-co-LSA) ]. The hydrolytic degradation of these amide bonds was found to be pH dependent. The characterization of the synthetic polycations, mainly PEI and its derivatives, was successfully performed by size exclusion chromatography in combination with static and dynamic laser light scattering. Using these methods the MW, the polydispersity and the hydrodynamic radii of the polycations was determined. The degree of branching of the hyperbranched PEIs was measured using 13 C-NNE-NMR spectroscopy. Further, estimations of the degree of branching were also achieved by the evaluation of viscosity data in combination with the absolute data of the static light scattering experiments (Mark-Houwink parameters).
