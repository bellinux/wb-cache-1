5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{achievements of}} <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> Sweden {{are those of}} two brothers, Sigtrygg and Lars Bengtsson, from 1219. The earliest example of Swedish civic heraldry is the city arms of Kalmar, which originated as a city seal in 1247. The seal (Swedish sigill), used extensively in the Middle Ages, was instrumental in spreading heraldry to churches, local governments, and other institutions, and was the forerunner of the coat of <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> medieval Sweden. Armorial seals of noblewomen appeared in the 12th century, burghers and artisans began adopting <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> the 13th century, and even some peasants took <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> the 14th century.|$|E
