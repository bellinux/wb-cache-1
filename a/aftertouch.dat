5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, {{to the extent that the}} Mellotron responds to <b>aftertouch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that Burnout 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and <b>Aftertouch</b> mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the <b>Aftertouch</b> mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aftertouches</b> {{is often}} {{described}} as part of a new school of enterprising electronic artists that lean heavily into electronic adventuring, both conceptually and sonically, [...] "as if to experiment with the very building blocks of musical beauty... to speak a language that not everyone speaks yet" [...] (Adam Harper, The Fader). Compared to its experimentalist contemporaries, <b>Aftertouches</b> approaches experimentalism with a more symphonic calculation and leaning towards composition, weaving both physical and technological realms to creates a series of celestial modern classical miniatures. The Wire describes <b>Aftertouches</b> as [...] "...the textless, fleshless voice-keyboard, the lingering foggy sublime of CPU-washed tone granules, the modular serialism of object oriented processes. The various parts are often starkly separated in colour and harmony, but the overall shape flows on smoothly either still learning from and resolving its experiences, or in thrall to an aesthetic that's beyond the horizon" [...] (The Wire, issue 376, June 2015). For Adhoc, Neil Lord writes [...] "The sweeping moments of beauty are balanced with stabs of electronic grit: an acrylic portrait of a Cronenberg-esque organism, morphing, half human, half machine." [...] <b>Aftertouches</b> was named one of the best 25 records {{of the first half of}} 2015 by Adhoc, and was called [...] "a true masterwork from a still young artist" [...] by Bobby Power in Decoder.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay depends of how {{versions}} are tweaked: lighter balls travel farther and higher {{and can be}} given zig-zag <b>aftertouches</b> (perfect from long range shots), {{but on the other}} hand, are more prone to be deflected by strong winds. Heavy balls barely lift from the floor which makes them more suitable for short passing, but are affected by wet grass. It's possible to score from any situation, including direct corners and freekicks, head deflections from long passes, bicycle kicks, working around the goalkeeper or pressing the defense and try to tackle the ball in.|$|R

Since 2011, Coverdale has collaborated live and in studio with electronic composer Tim Hecker, most notably on his 2013 album Virgins. She has also collaborated with the digital information artist LXV (David Sutton). In 2012 she self-released a series of solo piano pieces called Triptych. In 2013 she composed music for Wind Controller called [...] "Conversion Music" [...] which was premiered at LMCML by Montreal clarinetist Suzu Enns.

500|$|Ward {{noted that}} EA's snowboarding video game series SSX was an {{influence}} for Burnout 3s bolder and brasher nature. There was {{an emphasis on}} making the game more aggressive than previous instalments. Ward described Burnout 3 as a game about [...] "fighting through traffic" [...] rather than [...] "racing through traffic". This approach to the game's design led {{to the introduction of}} Takedowns, a feature that rewarded the player with boost and points for knocking their opponents off the track. The Takedown mechanic became a focal point of Burnout 3s design and led to other innovations. At first, the team were not convinced by the idea of having the game's camera pan to show the crash of a taken out vehicle while the player was driving; however, once it was implemented, they agreed that the feature worked well. From there, they decided to show a player's crash as well, which gave rise to the <b>aftertouch</b> mechanic. The crash mode from Burnout 2 was expanded and redesigned to be more puzzle-based; <b>aftertouch</b> control, crashbreakers, and multiplayer support were added to the mode. They wanted to include ramps in crash events so that vehicles could fly into traffic, however the game's physics system was designed to push cars down on the track to prevent them from taking off during a race. This caused vehicles to descend immediately after driving off a ramp. To bypass this issue they [...] "killed" [...] the vehicle once it hit the ramp, leaving it a wreck that was unaffected by the driving physics.|$|E
500|$|Road Rage is a {{new game}} mode in which the player must achieve {{a certain number of}} Takedowns in a preset time limit or before their vehicle is totaled. Cars {{continuously}} spawn in Road Rage so that there are always vehicles to perform Takedowns on. The Crash mode from [...] returns but has been enhanced to accommodate the <b>Aftertouch</b> feature. The goal of Crash mode is to create the largest amount of monetary damage in a multi-vehicle collision at a junction full of traffic. The game includes a total of one hundred Crash junctions. When a set number of vehicles become involved in the pileup, a Crashbreaker is unlocked which allows the player to detonate their vehicle to cause further damage Cash bonuses, score multipliers, a speed boost, or an immediate Crashbreaker can be obtained by driving through power-ups that lie on track in Crash mode. One particular power-up, the Heartbreaker, has a negative effect by reducing the total score.|$|E
500|$|The {{expanded}} and refined Crash mode was embraced by critics {{who found the}} gameplay to be addictive. Reiner highlighted Crash mode as his favourite part of the game, and Eurogamer writer Kristan Reed stated {{that it was the}} mode he spent the most time playing. Edge welcomed the inclusion of ramps and <b>aftertouch,</b> stating that the design of the mode had become [...] "more complex and focused". They thought Crash mode had evolved into a substantial component that was capable of being released as a standalone product. Mirabella and Reed both complimented the balance and variation of events in World Tour, and GamesTM was pleased with the amount of content featured in the single-player component. Gerstmann agreed that Burnout 3 offered a large amount of content and excellent replay value. He also felt that the progression of difficulty in World Tour was done effectively by introducing a faster cars throughout the campaign at reasonable pace. Reviewers were in agreement that Burnout 3s engaging and frenetic gameplay remained intact during online play. Reed stated that {{he would have liked to}} see the single-player content become more integrated into the online component, citing other existing racing games as examples. He thought that progress across single-player events should be recorded in online leaderboards enabling score comparisons with friends. Mirabella believed Criterion had largely triumphed in creating a great online component.|$|E
50|$|The Ion's {{keyboard}} has velocity sensitivity, but not <b>aftertouch.</b> However, {{the sound}} engine {{is capable of}} responding to both channel and polyphonic <b>aftertouch</b> messages received via MIDI. This feature means that with an external polyphonic <b>aftertouch</b> keyboard controller, the Ion {{can be made to}} modulate notes individually with finger pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Physically, the {{instrument}} used a 61-note synthesizer action keyboard. [...] "Synthesizer action" [...] {{means that it}} did not have weighted or semi-weighted keys, a common feature on stage pianos marketed at pianists. The DW-8000 keys were velocity sensitive. As such, a light press triggered a quieter sound and a hard press triggered a louder sound. As well, its keys could sense channel-pressure <b>aftertouch</b> as well. <b>Aftertouch</b> is the placing of pressure on keys after the initial striking or pressing of the keys. On a digital keyboard with <b>aftertouch</b> sensitivity, when the performer continues to press the keys, the <b>aftertouch</b> sensors {{send a message to the}} synth module; depending on the programming of the synth patch and/or the settings selected by the performer, <b>aftertouch</b> can trigger a digital effect (e.g., vibrato) or a change in the timbre (tone colour). The keyboard sents <b>aftertouch</b> messages via MIDI if required.|$|E
50|$|Its {{low-pass}} filters are analog (CEM 3379), but digitally controlled, {{and thus can}} be modulated by {{a significant number of}} sources, including LFO, envelopes, velocity, <b>aftertouch,</b> modulation wheel, et cetera. Even though the filter resonance can be driven to extreme effect, the resonance setting features only 32 steps, and the filters do not self-oscillate. The ESQ-1's keybed doesn't feature <b>aftertouch,</b> but the synthesis engine is capable of processing polyphonic <b>aftertouch</b> over MIDI.|$|E
50|$|On {{electronic}} keyboards and synthesizers, {{pressure sensitivity}} is usually called <b>aftertouch.</b> The {{vast majority of}} such instruments use only channel aftertouch: that is, one level of pressure is reported across the entire keyboard, which affects either all notes pressed (even ones not being pushed into <b>aftertouch)</b> or {{a subset of the}} active notes in some instruments that allow this level of control. A minority of instruments have polyphonic <b>aftertouch,</b> in which each individual note has its own sensor for pressure that enables differing usage of <b>aftertouch</b> for different notes. <b>Aftertouch</b> sensors detect whether the musician is continuing to exert pressure after the initial strike of the key. The <b>aftertouch</b> feature allows keyboard players to change the tone or sound of a note after it is struck, the way that singers, wind players, or bowed instrument players can do. On some keyboards, sounds or synth voices have a preset pressure sensitivity effect, such as a swell in volume (mimicking a popular idiomatic style of vocal performance with melodies) or the addition of vibrato. On some keyboards - a good example of such an instrument being Yamaha's richly-programmable cult-status synthesiser-workstation, the Yamaha EX5 - the player can select the effects to which <b>aftertouch</b> applies. This allows a performer to custom-tailor the effect that they desire. It may also facilitate the imitation of various non-keyboard instruments. For example, a keyboardist who wishes to imitate the sound of a heavy metal guitar solo could use a distortion guitar sound, and then set the <b>aftertouch</b> feature to apply a pitch bend to the note.|$|E

50|$|Examples of displacement-responding sensors {{include the}} {{mechanical}} action of tracker organs, {{as well as}} the force-sensing resistors found in music keyboards that had polyphonic <b>aftertouch</b> capability.

50|$|It {{contained}} {{a number of}} interesting innovations, some of which remain fairly uncommon. For example, most MIDI controllers provide <b>aftertouch</b> data, but the Midiboard is capable of polyphonic <b>aftertouch,</b> a feature found on few other keyboards. The Midiboard also provides comprehensive signal routing, layering, and transposition control. These advanced features are not without their cost: the Midiboard weighs approximately 100 lb and is fairly difficult to use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Aftertouch</b> {{messages}} (also {{known as}} Poly Pressure messages) are sent in some instruments to indicate pressure {{changes on the}} note while it is being played. Similarly, channel pressure changes the pressure for the entire instrument, not just one note. The channel pressure messages are more commonly implemented in most synthesizers, while the individual pressure sensors that <b>aftertouch</b> messages require are reserved mainly for expensive, high-end synthesizers.|$|E

50|$|The piano, being velocity-sensitive, {{responds}} to {{the speed of the}} key-press in how fast the hammers strike the strings, which in turn changes the tone and volume of the sound. Several piano predecessors, such as the harpsichord, were not velocity-sensitive like the piano. Some confuse pressure-sensitive with velocity-sensitive. To avoid this confusion, pressure sensitivity is often, perhaps usually, called <b>aftertouch.</b> The MIDI standard supports both velocity and <b>aftertouch.</b>|$|E

In bank B, one might then choose DC as the source, VCO2 pitch as the destination, and velocity as the controller.
