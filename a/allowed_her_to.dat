Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha-emissions.(α-emission).

5|$|By {{the time}} of season two's nineteenth episode, the writers had decided Helen's fate.

5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection.

Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E

5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead.
