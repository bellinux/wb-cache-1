40|$|Assay {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} proposed as a criterion for including psychiatric clinical outcome studies in meta-analyses. The authors assess the performance of assay sensitivity as a method for determining study appropriateness for meta-analysis by calculating expected standard drug vs placebo eect sizes for various combinations of high quality and <b>awed</b> studies. In the absence of <b>awed</b> studies, expected eect sizes are close to unbiased only when sample sizes are very large. In the presence of <b>awed</b> studies, expected eect sizes tend to be substantially biased except under simultaneous conditions of high power, {{a large proportion of}} <b>awed</b> studies, and a population standard vs placebo eect size of <b>awed</b> studies considerably lower than that of high quality studies. The authors conclude that this method is not robust and can lead to serious bias. Unless it can be shown that specic conditions hold, assay sensitivity should not be used to make quality judgments of studies. Copyright? 2005 Joh...|$|R

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express was developed by <b>AWE</b> Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely the same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from <b>AWE</b> Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E
5|$|Cladich: The little {{hamlet of}} Cladich above Loch <b>Awe</b> near {{the road to}} Inveraray was a center of weaving {{and almost all of}} the {{inhabitants}} were MacIntyres.

5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in <b>awe</b> of him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|On 3 November 2006, Litvinenko (under {{the name}} of Edwin Carter) was {{admitted}} for further investigation at Barnet General Hospital, London. After being moved from his local hospital in north London to University College Hospital in central London for intensive care, his blood and urine samples {{were sent to the}} UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (<b>AWE)</b> for testing. Scientists at <b>AWE</b> tested for radioactive poison using gamma spectroscopy. No gamma rays were detected; however, a small spike was noticed at an energy of 803 kilo-electron volts (keV). The BBC reported that by coincidence another scientist, who had worked on Britain's early atomic bomb programme decades before, happened to overhear a discussion about the small spike and recognised it as the gamma ray signal from polonium-210, which was a critical component of early nuclear bombs. On the evening of 22 November, shortly before his death, his doctors were informed the poison was likely to be polonium-210. Further tests on a larger urine sample using spectroscopy designed to detect alpha radiation confirmed the result the following day.|$|E

Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many Christians and Jews. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E

Ben Cruachan is the tallest mountain in the region. Tea-towels and postcards of her are sold in the visitor shop for the Hollow Mountain, which also features a mural depicting her accidental creation of Loch <b>Awe.</b>|$|E
5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient <b>awe</b> of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to <b>awe</b> audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch <b>Awe</b> and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of <b>awe</b> and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe that truth and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and <b>awe</b> at life itself.|$|E

5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in <b>awe.</b> After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. <b>AWE</b> Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī <b>awe,</b> tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), the whiteness of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
