5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric {{decontamination}} with activated charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys <b>are</b> <b>failing.</b> Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E

25|$|Ezio's story {{continues}} in 1499, where he exits the Vault, confused {{by what he}} saw inside. He escapes Rome with his uncle, Mario Auditore, and returns to Monteriggioni. Once home, Ezio is comforted by the prospect that his personal vendetta is over; however, Niccolò Machiavelli challenges Ezio's decision to leave Rodrigo Borgia (now Pope Alexander VI) alive. The following morning - New Year’s Day - Monteriggioni is besieged by Cesare Borgia, son of Rodrigo. Mario is killed at the hands of Cesare himself, and the Apple lost to Cesare and the Templars. Ezio escapes with his family and travels once more to Rome, the center of Templar power in Italy, once again seeking vengeance against the Borgias. There, he discovers that the Assassins <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> in their fight against corruption. Determined to rebuild the Guild, Ezio convinces Machiavelli that he has what it takes to lead while assembling a Brotherhood powerful enough to destroy the Templars and his new nemesis, Cesare.|$|E
25|$|Escaping {{into hiding}} with Sae's help, the protagonist convenes with his friends, Sae, and Sojiro; they {{determine}} that the conspiracy's leader is Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, the protagonist later recognizes Shido as the same man he encountered before his probation. The group infiltrates Shido's Palace, and there they face Akechi, revealed to be Shido's illegitimate son bent on revenge towards Shido for his years of neglect. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to allow the Phantom Thieves to reach Shido. Shido is defeated, and {{in the real world}} confesses to all his actions. The game then skips forward to just before Christmas; the general public has turned on the Phantom Thieves, and Sae's efforts to prosecute Shido <b>are</b> <b>failing.</b> The Phantom Thieves make a final heist to steal the Treasure of the Mementos, the people's Palace at the Metaverse's core. Inside they find the imprisoned Shadows of their targets and other Tokyo residents, who have chosen to give up making their own decisions. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure—a giant Holy Grail—and subsequently vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merging with reality.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{money market}} funds began disintermediating banks from their classic {{interposition}} between savers and borrowers. The funds provided a more direct link, with less overhead. Large banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Notably, the Fed is itself owned by the large private banks, and controls the overall supply {{of money in the}} United States. The OCC is housed within the Treasury Department, which in turn manages the issuance and maintenance of the multi-trillion dollar debt of the U.S. government. The overall debt is of course connected to ongoing federal government spending vs. actual ongoing tax receipts. Unquestionably, the private banking industry, bank regulation, the national debt, and ongoing governmental spending politics are substantially interconnected. Interest rates incurred on the national debt is subject to rate setting by the Fed, and inflation (all else being equal) allows today's fixed debt obligation to be paid off in ever cheaper to obtain dollars. The third major bank regulator, designed to swiftly remove failing banks is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bailout fund and resolution authority that can eliminate banks that <b>are</b> <b>failing,</b> with minimum disruption to the banking industry itself. They also help ensure depositors continue to do business with banks after such failures by insuring their deposits.|$|E

2500|$|The {{action of}} the novel takes place from 14–20 April 1964, as Germany prepares for Hitler's 75th {{birthday}} celebrations on the 20th. A visit by the President of the United States, Joseph P. Kennedy, is planned {{as part of a}} gradual détente between the United States and the Greater German Reich. The novel suggests that the Nazi hierarchy is eager for peace because its efforts to settle the conquered Eastern lands <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> due to continued resistance from Polish and Soviet partisan movements. Moreover, the Nazis failed to instil their ideology in the younger generation, and many young Germans turn away from it [...] though active opposition to the regime is limited.|$|E

[...] Some male civilian internees chose to cultivate land around their compound in order to become self-supporting; however, the other work imposed on them meant that they never cultivated the land to its full effect. Some refused to carry out this work, even though it was for the common good. Work included wood-gathering parties, latrine duties, working as cookhouse staff and medical orderlies. Sundays were a rest day, but these were later cut to one in every three weeks.|$|E

[...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E

2500|$|The {{movement}} of the verse in the first version is swift and spontaneous, a true letter, and the tone is simultaneously exalted and self-pitying; while in 'Dejection' the verse is cunningly shaped into eight irregular stanzas, and the outpouring of grief is carefully controlled and led into a climax of joy and blessing. The first version overwhelms the reader with its intimacy, its torrent of lament and letting-go, which is both shocking and compulsive. The final version holds the reader {{in an act of}} high, rhetorical attention, around the proposition that external nature cannot heal the poet (as Wordsworth believed it could) whose own powers <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> [...] Yet however much 'Dejection' is to be preferred as a finished work of art, the 'Letter' draws more directly on Coleridge's true imaginative life.

2500|$|In 2017, {{a report}} by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the {{previous}} year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK. Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the charging of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: [...] "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews <b>are</b> <b>failing</b> to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stover {{helped develop}} a [...] "track in a box" [...] {{to see how}} {{simulated}} hoof impacts are affected by different surfaces. Stover said, [...] "In the laboratory, many new factors — for example, new surfaces and horseshoes — can be studied that optimize traction while reducing injury risk. Laboratory studies also control the environmental circumstances, thus avoiding the confounding of the results incurred by the multiple environmental variants in natural racetrack settings." [...] Roughly 50% of catastrophic breakdowns involve the fetlock joint, which connects the pastern and cannon bone. When a hoof strikes a racing surface, there is some slide, which helps reduce impact forces in excess of 10,000 Newtons but {{increases the risk of}} hyperextension of the joint. If the slide is too short, fractures of the first phalanx (P1) may result. This happens most frequently on turf and may be associated with studs on the horseshoe. On the other hand, Stover said that [...] "the more hyperextension the fetlock undergoes, the higher the stresses that are put on the structures that <b>are</b> <b>failing.</b> If we can show that certain surfaces minimize hyperextension, they should minimize catastrophic injuries." ...|$|E
