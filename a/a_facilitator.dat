5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is <b>a</b> <b>facilitator,</b> a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
5|$|Raymond grows {{furious with}} Rusty's {{handling}} of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty calls on Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr {{and his son}} Aage, a {{physicist}} who acted as his father's assistant, arrived on 30 December {{on the first of}} several visits as a consultant. Bohr and his family had escaped from occupied Denmark to Sweden. A De Havilland Mosquito bomber brought him to England where he joined Tube Alloys. In America, he was able to visit Oak Ridge and Los Alamos, where he found many of his former students. Bohr acted as a critic, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> and a role model for younger scientists. He arrived at a critical time, and several nuclear fission studies and experiments were conducted at his instigation. He {{played an important role in}} the development of the uranium tamper, and in the design and adoption of the modulated neutron initiator. His presence boosted morale, and helped improve the administration of the laboratory to strengthen ties with the Army.|$|E

5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> asks; a teacher lectures from the front, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). <b>A</b> <b>facilitator</b> should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
50|$|Conversational {{dynamics}} {{are important}} to successful consensus conferences. More outspoken citizens tend to dominate the conversation. This can potentially be avoided with <b>a</b> well-trained <b>facilitator.</b> This brings up {{the question of how}} to evaluate <b>facilitators,</b> <b>an</b> area that has not been actively researched.|$|R

25|$|According to the {{instrumental}} view, {{one explanation for}} greater subjective well-being among extraverts could be that extraversion helps {{in the creation of}} life circumstances, which promote high levels of positive affect. Specifically, the personality trait of extraversion is seen as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> of more social interactions, since the low cortical arousal among extraverts results in them seeking more social situations in order to increase their arousal.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to achieve the right balance between the degree of structure and flexibility that {{is built into the}} learning process. Savery (1994) contends that the more structured the learning environment, the harder it is for the learners to construct meaning based on their conceptual understandings. <b>A</b> <b>facilitator</b> should structure the learning experience just enough {{to make sure that the}} students get clear guidance and parameters within which to achieve the learning objectives, yet the learning experience should be open and free enough to allow for the learners to discover, enjoy, interact and arrive at their own, socially verified version of truth.|$|E
25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs {{to give each}} other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. The person {{in the role of}} counsellor acts as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E
25|$|During the 2007–08 season, after a {{trade that}} sent Gordan Giricek to the Philadelphia 76ers in {{exchange}} for Kyle Korver, the Jazz had a record-tying 19-game home winning streak and improved on the road after a rough December. Despite the off-season controversy and trade talk, Kirilenko elevated his play, improving all stats from the previous season, and seemed content with his new role as a defender and <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> opposed to a scorer. Boozer again was an All-Star selection, while Williams continued to elevate his play. The Jazz finished the regular season fifth-best in the Western Conference with a 54–28 record. The Jazz sold out 46 of 47 home games (including playoffs) during the year, and possessed a 37–4 home regular season record; that was, however, offset by a sub-par road win-loss record.|$|E

50|$|One such {{development}} {{intervention is}} to have the virtual team self-facilitate. Normally, a team will bring in <b>an</b> outside <b>facilitator</b> to ensure that the team is correctly utilizing the technology. This is a very costly method of developing the team, but an advantage that virtual teams possess is the ability to self-facilitate. This makes the role of <b>an</b> outside <b>facilitator</b> practically void, and saves the team time, effort, and resources.|$|R
25|$|Though NBA.com lists George's height as 6ft 9 in (2.06 m), a December 15, 2011 {{report from}} The Indianapolis Star said that George was 6ft 10 in (2.08 m). He entered the league as a {{shooting}} guard but was later {{moved to the}} small forward position, {{with the emergence of}} Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson. Stephenson's improvement as <b>a</b> <b>facilitator</b> and distributor in the backcourt allowed George to play off the ball more often during games. Early in his career, he was unable to create shots for himself and lacked a great deal of ball handle, something he worked on with trainer Jerry Powell during the 2012 off-season. With All-Star swingman Danny Granger injured during the 2012–13 season, George took on a larger offensive responsibility, which resulted in the NBA Most Improved Player Award.|$|E

25|$|Negotiated {{performance}} appraisal: The negotiated {{performance appraisal}} (NPA) is an emerging approach for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and for increasing employee productivity, {{and may also}} be adapted to an alternate mediation model for supervisor-subordinate conflicts. <b>A</b> <b>facilitator</b> meets separately with the supervisor and with the subordinate to prepare three lists. What employees do well, where the employee has improved in recently, and areas where the employee still needs to improve. Because the subordinate will present his or her lists first during the joint session, this reduces defensive behaviors. Furthermore, the subordinate comes to the joint session not only prepared to share areas of needed improvement, but also brings concrete ideas as to how these improvements can be made. The NPA also focuses very strongly on what employees are doing well, and involves a minimum of twenty minutes of praise when discussing what the employee does well. The role of the facilitator {{is that of a}} coach in the pre-caucuses, and in the joint sessions the supervisor and subordinate mostly speak to each other with little facilitator interference.|$|E
