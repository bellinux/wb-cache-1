5|$|In September 2006, the B-52 {{became one}} of the first US {{military}} aircraft to fly using alternative fuel. It took off from Edwards Air Force Base with a 50/50 blend of Fischer-Tropsch process (FT) synthetic fuel and conventional JP-8 jet fuel, which burned in two of the eight engines. On 15 December 2006, a B-52 took off from Edwards with the synthetic fuel powering all eight engines, the first time an air force aircraft was entirely powered by the blend. The seven-hour flight was considered a success. This program is part of the Department of Defense Assured Fuel Initiative, which aims to reduce crude oil usage and obtain half of its aviation fuel from alternative sources by 2016. On 8 August 2007, Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne certified the B-52H as fully <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> use the FT blend.|$|E

The variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes. Neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury, {{have been the subject}} of interest follows TBI. However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful or not. A 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children. High quality evidence to support targeted temperature management below normal however is poor.|$|E

A multitude of buildings, including churches, a visitor's center, the House of Assembly building in Hamilton, and the Bermuda Police Service headquarters at Prospect Camp, suffered some degree of roof damage. Older structures were particularly prone to substantial damage, as were commercial storage buildings subject to less strict building codes. In December, five new slate quarries were <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the demand for roofing materials. Both the new and old portions of the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital received significant damage that exposed the facilities to the elements. An exhibit at the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo was unroofed, and coastal erosion threatened to encroach on the site, though no animals were harmed. Part of the structure's roof was blown a quarter mile (400 m).|$|E

In 2015, a plan was <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the contraceptive vaccine the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted.

5|$|The {{portion of}} the turnpike in the Philadelphia area had become a {{congested}} commuter road by the 1980s. In 1983, funding was <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> widen the turnpike to six lanes between the Valley Forge and Philadelphia interchanges. This planned project was put on hold because of disagreements between Governor Dick Thornburgh and the turnpike commission members, and differences between the commissioners. The Pennsylvania Legislature approved the project in 1985; the road would be widened between the Norristown and Philadelphia interchanges. Construction on the widening began on March 10, 1986, and was completed on November 23, 1987 with a ribbon-cutting at the Philadelphia interchange. The widening project cost $120 million. An interchange to serve the New Cumberland Defense Depot near Harrisburg was planned in the 1980s. In 1992, the turnpike commission decided not to build it because it would instead build a connector road to the depot between PA 114 and Old York Road that would parallel the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-one miners {{were killed}} in an {{accident}} in Ny-Ålesund in 1962. The resulting Kings Bay Affair, where unsafe mining had been <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> maintain an increased Norwegian presence on Svalbard, ultimately led to vote of no confidence in Parliament and the withdrawal of Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen's third cabinet. Oil drilling was started by Caltex in 1961. Caltex was granted claims based on indications of oil, rather than samples. Arktikugol was not granted claims based on similar evidence, contributing to tensions with the Soviet Union. Both the Kings Bay Affair and the Caltex Affair initiated public debate about the administration of Svalbard, {{and in particular the}} lack of resources and control of Soviet settlements. Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements. More than half the archipelago was protected in 1972 through four national parks, fourteen bird sanctuaries and four nature reserves. Store Norske was nationalized between 1973 and 1976.|$|E

Balwearie High School opened as a junior secondary school in 1964 and was upgraded to a high school in 1972. The school serves pupils living in the western end of the town and neighbouring Kinghorn and Burntisland. Viewforth High School, which opened in 1908, was also initially a junior secondary school, but upgraded to a high school in 1980. Plans have been <b>approved</b> <b>to</b> build a new secondary school for Kirkcaldy East {{at the site of the}} Windmill Road Playing Fields. Work will be funded through the Building Fife's School Project for completion in August 2016.
