5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|The French playwright Victorien Sardou wrote {{more than}} 70 plays, {{almost all of}} them successful, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{performed}} today. In the early 1880s Sardou began a collaboration with actress Sarah Bernhardt, whom he provided with a series of historical melodramas. His third Bernhardt play, La Tosca, which premiered in Paris on 24November 1887, and in which she starred throughout Europe, was an outstanding success, with more than 3,000 performances in France alone.|$|E

5|$|Nine manuscripts {{survive in}} whole or in part, though not all are of equal {{historical}} value <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the Chronicle {{is in the form of}} annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> is effective under all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences {{can be drawn from}} the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl are convinced that the discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Port Arthur on {{the second}} day of the war, Poltava was hit twice in the aft hull, Petropavlovsk was hit three times in the bow and Sevastopol was hit once. Between them, the three ships lost two men killed and seven wounded <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{suffered}} any significant damage. Tsar Nicholas II relieved Stark and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov who assumed command on 7 March. On 31 March, Petropavlovsk and Poltava sortied to support Russian cruisers and destroyers engaging their Japanese counterparts, but they headed back to Port Arthur to join the rest of the Pacific Squadron when the main Japanese battlefleet appeared. They ran into a newly laid minefield en route and Petropavlovsk struck at least one of the mines. Observers saw three explosions, one of which appeared to be that of her magazines, and the ship sank in less than two minutes. Casualties included Admiral Makarov and his guest, Russian battle artist Vasily Vereshchagin, 26 officers and 652 enlisted men. Only seven officers and 73 crewmen were rescued.|$|E

25|$|Many clubs {{disliked the}} {{competition}} and saw it as disruptive in the preparation for the new season. As a consequence, they did not nominate themselves for participation even if entitled. In particular, following its 1995 relaunch, clubs in England were sceptical about the competition; after initially being offered three places in the cup, all English top division teams rejected the chance to take part. Following the threat of bans of English teams from all UEFA competitions, the situation was eventually resolved with three English clubs entering weakened teams, <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> qualified.|$|E

25|$|In 1997, the German {{author and}} {{historian}} Michael Hesemann performed {{an investigation of}} the relic. Hesemann presented the inscription of the title to seven experts on Hebrew, Greek and Latin palaeography: Gabriel Barkay of the Israel Antiquities Authority, Hanan Eshel, Ester Eshel and Leah Di Segni of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel Roll and Benjamin Isaac of the University of Tel Aviv and Carsten Peter Thiede of Paderborn/Germany and the University of Beer Sheva, Israel. According to Hesemann, none of the consulted experts found any indication of a mediaeval or late antique forgery. They all dated it in the timeframe between the 1st and the 3rd–4th century AD, with a majority of experts preferring <b>and</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> excluding the 1st century. Hesemann concluded that it is very well possible that the Titulus Crucis is indeed the authentic relic.|$|E
25|$|Some philodendrons are, however, {{known to}} be toxic to mice and rats. In one study, 100mg of Philodendron cordatum leaves {{suspended}} in distilled water were fed to six mice.

Leaves and flowers of Philodendron sagittifolium were also orally administered in 100-mg doses to the mice. Three mice were used {{for each of the}} leaves and flowers; none of the mice died. A similar experiment was done on rats with the leaves and stems of P. cordatum, but instead of oral administration of the dose, it was injected intraperitoneally using 3 g of plant extract from either the leaves or stems. Six rats were injected with the leaf extract and five of them died. Eight rats were injected with the stem extract and two of them died.|$|E
