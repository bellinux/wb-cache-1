In pure THF the relaxation was observed to be the usual monoexponential decay. In mixed aqueous-organic solvent solutions however, all poly-(DR 1 A-co-AA) samples showed a highly unusual biexponential rate decay, with both a slow isomerization process due to inhibited mobility of the <b>azo</b> <b>groups,</b> and a faster isomerization process for unaggregated <b>azo</b> <b>groups.</b> In these systems, the relaxation of the cis-isomer was fit well with a biexponential function, which clearly demonstrates two distinct local chromophore environments.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{synthesis}} of starch macroinitiators for cationic polymer grafted starches that: W are free of cationic homopolymer, and (ii) display {{a high degree of}} conversion of the cationic monomer. We show that this can be achieved by a free-radical polymerization reaction using the cationic monomer N-methaeryloyloxyethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-benzylammonium chloride (XLADAM-BQ) and a new starch-based macroazoinitiator. For this purpose, the acid chloride of 4 -tert-butylazo- 4 -cyanovaleric acid was synthesized and bound covalently to starch (predominantly in the C 6 position) to form a nonsymmetrically substituted macroinitiator that was used to polymerize MADAM-BQ in aqueous media. Essentially no MADAM-BQ homopolymer was formed. The initiator decomposes thermally to starch radicals of high reactivity and low-molar mass radicals that do not initiate polymerization. The reason for the different reactivities of the radicals is presumably due to the nonsymmetric constitution of the starch-bound <b>azo</b> <b>groups.</b> The graft polymerization of MADAM-BQ in aqueous solution performs according to an ideal overall kinetic. The structure of the synthesized starch-graft-poly(MADAM-BQ) products {{is similar to that of}} block copolymers because of the low radical efficiency of the starch initiators in aqueous solution. Especially, starch substrates with a higher content of <b>azo</b> <b>groups</b> did not lead to graft products with shorter graft distances because the state of solution of these macroinitiators becomes worse and aggregation occurs with an increasing degree of substitution...|$|R
