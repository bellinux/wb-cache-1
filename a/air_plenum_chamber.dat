Bleeding seal <b>air</b> from <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> to the mill maintains separation between pulverized fuel in the Mill {{and the outside}} atmosphere.

This phenomenon consists of a random sequence of individual relaxation cycles. Mass flow entering the diffuser during steady operation is suddenly cut off by a strong interaction between the subcritical shock and boundary layer {{on the surface of}} the external compression generator, which blocks the inlet. <b>Air</b> in the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber,</b> stored at high pressure, then ?blows down? until the inlet can restart. The subsequent supercritical flow entering the diffuser exceeds the flow rate at the exit and the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> is re-charged to the original condition. A distinction is drawn between this phenomenon and a high frequency wave-type resonance noticed at low mass flows and during an individual buzz cycle after the diffuser shock system has been expelled. For the large diffuser tested here, this high frequency oscillation compares well to the 8 th closed-end organ pipe mode of the diffuser at low mass flows and to the 9 th mode during the shock-expelled phase of the buzz cycle. It is shown that burning almost always ceases in the presence of buzz. When burning was maintained during buzz, it was found to have no qualitative effect on the buzz cycle...|$|R

A <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber,</b> which connects slots in the circumferential direction, can occasionally be found in slot-type casing treatments. This study investigates the effect of a <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> on the compressor overall performance and stall margin via time-accurate three-dimensional numerical simulations in a transonic compressor NASA Rotor 37 with a slot-type casing treatment. Four configurations with variable height of <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> are numerically investigated. The unsteady influence of the casing treatment on compressor flow fields is studied using fast Fourier transforms to gain a deeper insight into the function of the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber.</b> The results indicate that the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> can reduce the penalty on the compressor’s total pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency induced by the casing treatment effect at the design operating condition. A detuning effect of the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> is found and proven to be responsible for the decreased compressor performance penalty through a detailed analysis in both the blade passage and casing treatments. The detuning effect dampens the unsteady influence of the casing treatment on the compressor passage flow in terms of shock oscillations and mass flow fluctuations. Thus, the radial scope and degree of the influence induced by the casing treatment is distinctly restrained by the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber.</b> Slot circulation, which is composed of a bleed flow from the passage into the slots and injection flow from the slots into the passage, is closely related to the stall margin improve-ment as the casing treatment is implemented. The <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> has no significant impact on the slot circulation and thus on compressor stall margin. However, shallow slots decrease the slot circulation efficiency, which leads to a much lower stall margin enhancement...|$|R

Static pressure tapings are provided at two planes on the <b>plenum</b> <b>chamber</b> {{in order to obtain}} the pressure drop across it. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is used to visualize the flow and provide 2 D quantitative information about the velocity field. From the resulting outputs, the pressure drop across the plenum without a cylindrical hub implanted at the centre was found to be higher than with it. Although the existence of hub increases the viscous friction due to more area in contact with fluid, the more pronounced form drag caused by the abrupt flow expansion in the empty bed is greatly reduced in the column with hub. Furthermore, elimination of losses near a wide region at the column center give the latter set up an advantage with respect to pressure loss. As a result, less pressure drop across the chamber with a hub incorporated is of evident.
