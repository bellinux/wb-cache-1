The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming <b>and</b> <b>moaning</b> from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} that Martí established between prose and poetry are conceptual. Poetry, as he believes, is {{a language of}} the permanent subjective: the intuition and the vision. The prose is an instrument and a method of spreading the ideas, and has the goal of elevating, encouraging and animating these ideas rather than having the expression of tearing up the heart, complaining <b>and</b> <b>moaning.</b> The prose is a service to his people.|$|E

C-Block is reputedly haunted by the spirit of former inmate Abie Maldowitz (nicknamed Butcher) who was murdered in the laundry room. On September 5, 1984, a ranger spent the night alone on the island and was awakened by a heavy door swinging in C-Block, but found no cause for it; the door swinging continued on other nights.|$|E
25|$|Around 10:30p.m. MST, the {{supervisor}} for the contractor running the site (Combustion Engineering) {{and the chief}} health physicist arrived. They entered the reactor building around 10:45 pm and found two mutilated men soaked with water: one clearly dead (Byrnes), the other moving slightly (McKinley) <b>and</b> <b>moaning.</b> With one entry per person and a 1-minute limit, a team of 5 men with stretchers recovered the operator who was still breathing around 10:50; he did not regain consciousness and died of his head injury at about 11 p.m. Even stripped, his body was so contaminated that it was emitting about 500 R/hr. Meanwhile, the third man was discovered about 10:38 p.m., impaled to the ceiling. With all potential survivors now recovered, safety of rescuers took precedence and work was slowed to protect them.|$|E

[...] Bakshi is quoted as saying [...] "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching <b>and</b> <b>moaning</b> to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie.

500|$|The Bill Hamel remix of [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] is {{a trance}} track with {{elements}} of ambient.

The album's fourth track, the Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke Mix of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] slows the beat from the original track making the song [...] "darker and dirtier". The remix style was compared to songs by Kylie Minogue and Madonna. Dave Audé Slave Driver Mix of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] consists of a guitar track and [...] "quirky analog touches", according to Kurt Kirton of About.com. [...] "And Then We Kiss" [...] contains influences of euro-trance, techno and usage of synthesizers. The song blends dance-rock guitars and symphonic strings and closes with an orchestral overtone.

2500|$|At noon on July 6, Surratt was {{informed}} {{she would be}} hanged the next day. She wept profusely. [...] She was joined by two Catholic priests (Jacob Walter and B.F. Wiget) and her daughter Anna. Father Jacob remained with her almost until her death. Her menstrual problems had worsened, {{and she was in}} such pain and suffered from such severe cramps that the prison doctor gave her wine and medication. She repeatedly asserted her innocence. She spent the night on her mattress, weeping <b>and</b> <b>moaning</b> in pain and grief, ministered to by the priests. Anna left her mother's side at 8 A.M. on July 7 and went to the White House to beg for her mother's life one last time. Her entreaty rejected, she returned to the prison and her mother's cell at about 11 A.M. The soldiers began testing the gallows about 11:25 A.M.; the sound of the tests unnerved all the prisoners. Shortly before noon, Mary Surratt was taken from her cell and then allowed to sit in a chair near the entrance to the courtyard. The heat in the city that day was oppressive.

2500|$|Contrasting {{with some}} of the more sexual {{relationships}} of the other characters, Willow and Tara demonstrate a sentimental, soft, and consistent affection for each other. Some of this was pragmatic: the show was restricted in what it could present to viewers. Willow and Tara did not kiss until the fifth season in an episode that diverted the focus away from the display of affection when Buffy's mother dies in [...] "The Body". Before this, much of their sexuality is represented by allusions to witchcraft; spells doubled for physical affection such as an erotic ritual in [...] "Who Are You?" [...] where Willow and Tara chant and perspire in a circle of light until Willow falls back on a pillow gasping <b>and</b> <b>moaning.</b> Within the Buffy universe, magic is portrayed in a mostly female realm. As opposed to it being evil, it is an earth-bound force that is most proficiently harvested by women. The treatment of the lesbian relationship as integral to magic, representative of each other (love is magic, magic is love), earned the series some critical commentary from conservative Christians. To avoid large-scale criticism, scenes had to be shot several different ways because censors would not allow some types of action on screen. In the fourth and fifth seasons, the characters could be shown on a bed, but not under the covers. Hannigan noted the inconsistent standards with the other relationships on the show: [...] "you've got Spike and Harmony just going at it like rabbits, so it's very hypocritical". As a couple, Willow and Tara are treated {{by the rest of the}} Scoobies with acceptance and little fanfare. Susan Driver writes that younger viewers especially appreciate that Willow and Tara are able to be affectionate without becoming overly sexual, thus making them objects of fantasy for male enjoyment. Willow and Tara's influence on specifically younger female viewers is, according to Driver, [...] "remarkable".|$|E
