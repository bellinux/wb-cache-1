40|$|Eastern <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> (Terrapene {{carolina}} carolina) experience {{negative impacts}} from human activities. Collection for the pet trade or mortalities caused by lawn mowers and vehicles are detrimental to populations, which have experienced rapid decline in Indiana. Understanding perceptions and attitudes held about species can help outreach. This study aims to observe how perceptions and fear response differ between a) genders, b) contact with <b>box</b> <b>turtles,</b> and c) conservation group membership. Mail surveys {{were administered to}} 1, 378 residents of the Blue River Watershed in Southern Indiana. Respondents rated <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> on 11 semantic differential pairs and reported their agreement towards a series of Likert-scale questions that measured conservation and fear related attitudes. While fear response was relatively low across groups, women had had a significantly higher fear response (1. 71 out of 5) than men (1. 53). Women had higher agreement that <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are important to the}} Blue River ecosystem (4. 08 vs. 3. 77). Respondents who had encountered a <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> associated <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> with positive phrases and had higher agreement to ecosystem importance (3. 94 vs. 3. 39). Members of conservation groups had significantly higher agreement to ecosystem importance (4. 25) and approval of government spending on <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> conservation (3. 31) compared to non-members (3. 81 and 2. 94). There was no correlation between level of fear response and recognition of ecosystem importance. Exposure to <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> can be a mechanism of instilling positive perceptions of the species.

50|$|The McCord's <b>box</b> <b>turtle</b> is a {{critically}} endangered species from China. McCord's <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> have been hunted for meat, traditional medicine and a worldwide trade in turtles as pets. These factors, coupled with habitat loss {{due to the}} expansion of human populations, have pushed them to the brink of extinction. McCord's <b>box</b> <b>turtles</b> are now rarely seen in Chinese markets, one way of monitoring populations, and this may mean the species is extinct in the wild. The DZS is the manager and studbook keeper for the McCord's <b>Box</b> <b>Turtle</b> SSP to help maintain an assurance population of these turtles in zoos.
