25|$|Eco{{feminism}} is a {{term that}} links feminism with ecology. Its <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> that paternalistic/capitalistic society {{has led to a}} harmful split between nature and culture. Early ecofeminists propagated that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for nurture and holistic knowledge of nature's processes. Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the early}} 1950s to the present, {{more and more}} people in the United States have gone on to pursue degrees or {{certificates}} of higher education. However this has sparked some debate in recent years as some <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> that a degree is not what it was once worth to employers. To clarify some <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> that the financial costs that universities require from their students [...] has gone up so dramatically that it is leaving many students in debt of loans of an average of $33,000. Advocates advise parents to not send their children to college unless these children are committed to pursuing their future education. An increasing number of freshman every year drop out of their perspective programs or do not possess the maturity to have a balanced life away from home.|$|E
2500|$|While in the U.S. Senate, Obama has {{supported}} several gun control measures, including restricting {{the purchase of}} firearms at gun shows and the reauthorization of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. [...] Obama voted against legislation protecting firearm manufacturers from certain liability suits, which gun-rights <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> are designed to bankrupt the firearms industry. Obama did {{vote in favor of}} the 2006 Vitter Amendment to prohibit the confiscation of lawful firearms during an emergency or major disaster, which passed 84–16.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, Vitter – {{along with}} Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo of Idaho – blocked the {{confirmation}} of Michael J. Sullivan {{as head of the}} Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) saying Sullivan supports [...] "burdensome regulations" [...] on gun owners and dealers and is [...] "overly aggressive" [...] enforcing gun laws. An editorial writer for The Boston Globe wrote that Vitter's position was [...] "unreasonable" [...] because the guns Sullivan sought to control are those commonly used in crimes: those stolen or purchased on the black market. On the other hand, gun rights <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> that many gun dealers have lost their licenses for harmless bureaucratic errors. Sullivan stayed on as acting head of the ATF until January 2009 to make way for President Barack Obama to name his own nominee.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, The Times-Picayune {{reported}} that Vitter and the Bush administration opposed a provision of The Gulf Coast Housing Recovery bill which required that every public housing apartment torn down {{be replaced with}} another form of low-income housing on a one-for-one basis. The administration testified {{that there was not}} sufficient demand for public housing units, a position contested by several senators. Vitter stated it would recreate [...] "housing projects exactly as they were", isolated and riddled with crime. However, Mary Landrieu, the Louisiana Democratic Senator, said the intent was to make certain there were affordable places for working-class people who returned. The bill requires that demolished housing projects be replaced with mixed income communities which local housing <b>advocates</b> <b>say</b> is different from the massive public housing developments that Vitter is referring to. However, the bill does not include a ban on large-scale projects. The city housing authority is planning on replacing 4,000 low-income units with mixed-income projects providing a smaller inventory of low-income units. In December 2007, Vitter prevented the bill from leaving the committee.|$|E
2500|$|A plan by the Bush {{administration}} [...] "to privatize {{parts of}} the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership" [...] provoked disagreement within Amtrak's board of directors. Late in 2005 Gunn was fired. Gunn's replacement, Alexander Kummant (2006–08), was committed to operating a national rail network, and, like Gunn, opposed the notion of putting the Northeast Corridor under separate ownership. He said that shedding the system's long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks, and that Amtrak's abandonment of these routes would be irreversible. In late 2006, Amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of $1billion for ten years. In early 2007, Amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year, its highest amount {{since its founding in}} 1970. Politico noted a key problem: [...] "the rail system chronically operates in the red. A pattern has emerged: Congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the White House and appropriates enough funds to keep Amtrak from plunging into insolvency. But, Amtrak <b>advocates</b> <b>say,</b> that is not enough to fix the system's woes." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the book, Mapes {{makes an}} {{argument}} that making more room for the bicycle on American roads {{is something that we}} need. Mapes' book was published one year after J.
