5|$|Because of this <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geology of the region, {{water in}} the basin is hard: it has very high total {{dissolved}} solids concentrations, in excess of 3,000mg/l.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in multi-wall CNTs is complicated as their properties {{are determined by}} contribution of all individual shells; those shells have different structures, <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synthesis, are usually more defective than SWCNTs. Therefore, optical properties of MWCNTs will not be considered here.|$|E
5|$|Aberdaron {{is noted}} for {{low levels of}} air pollution. The Gwynedd State of the Environment Report in 2004 found levels of sulfur dioxide, {{nitrogen}} dioxide and carbon monoxide very low, and particulates to be low. It {{is one of the}} few sites in the United Kingdom for golden hair lichen, a striking bright orange lichen that is very sensitive to air pollution. The climate is relatively mild <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Stream, frosts are rare in winter.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea of using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E
5|$|Because Lazenby had {{informed}} the producers that On Her Majesty's Secret Service {{was to be}} his only outing as Bond <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack of gadgets used by Bond in the film, few items of merchandise were produced for the film, apart from the soundtrack album and a film edition of the book. Those that were produced included a number of Corgi Toys, including Tracey's Cougar, Campbell's Volkswagen and {{two versions of the}} bobsleigh—one with the 007 logo and one with the Piz Gloria logo. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was nominated for only one award: George Lazenby was nominated in the New Star of the Year – Actor category at the 1970 Golden Globe Award ceremony, losing out to Jon Voight.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, {{they can become}} the focus of public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Complement, an {{important}} component for serology, was first isolated from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as {{inconsistent}} gaps between trim sections and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and craftsmanship. In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|Paine {{traveled}} through Maine, {{where she had}} difficulty establishing herself for want of connections that she had relied upon in the past, so she returned to Providence {{and for the first}} time established herself in a highly respectable commercial building with, aside from herself, only male occupants. She struggled professionally <b>and,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss of her mother, she suffered personally. The career that she relied upon kept her forever traveling, which had made it difficult to establish long-standing relationships. Her relationship with her mother was the only close one of her life.|$|E
5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} a {{hallmark}} of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid Descent, where the mourning figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and The Madonna Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|Swanberg {{found the}} process of editing Digging for Fire more {{difficult}} than for his previous films, since there were many different possibilities of how to integrate the separate storylines involving Tim and Lee. He dedicated the film to Paul Mazursky, who died in 2014, because of the influence Mazursky had on Swanberg's work <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thematic similarities between Mazursky's work (particularly the 1969 film Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice) and Digging for Fire.|$|E

5|$|The Slavs {{arrived from}} the East between the 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period. As a {{response}} to onslaughts by Avars, the local Slavic tribes rebelled and established Samo's Empire (623–658), the first known Slavic political entity. In the 9th century, the castles at Bratislava (Brezalauspurc) and Devín (Dowina) were important centres of the Slavic states: the Principality of Nitra and Great Moravia. Scholars have debated the identification as fortresses of the two castles built in Great Moravia, based on linguistic arguments <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absence of convincing archaeological evidence.|$|E
5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Mayfair moved upper class Londoners away from {{areas such as}} Covent Garden and Soho, which were already in decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was because of its proximity to the Court of St James and the parks, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to various stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets. Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within the ravine {{at the base}} of the 167-foot-tall {{waterfall}} formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake. This north-south oriented ravine forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of the growing season, resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek flow and ice formations, is relatively warm in the winter compared to the surrounding area. Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire, {{the airport}} {{had to start}} rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{region in}} which the Mont Blanc massif is located has been {{occupied}} by man for at least 70,000 years, although, as now — <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great height and glaciated nature of the mountains — only the lower parts of the valleys around its perimeter would have been inhabited or used as routes of communication.|$|E
