50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the ars operon is an operon {{found in}} several bacterial taxon. It {{is required for}} the detoxification of arsenate, arsenite, and <b>antimonite.</b> This system transports arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> out of the cell. The pump is composed of two polypeptides, the products of the arsA and arsB genes. This two-subunit enzyme produces resistance to arsenite and <b>antimonite.</b> Arsenate, however, must first be reduced to arsenite before it is extruded. A third gene, arsC, expands the substrate specificity to allow for arsenate pumping and resistance. ArsC is an approximately 150-residue arsenate reductase that uses reduced glutathione (GSH) to convert arsenate to arsenite with a redox active cysteine residue in the active site. ArsC forms an active quaternary complex with GSH, arsenate, and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1). The three ligands must be present simultaneously for reduction to occur.|$|E

50|$|Arsenite {{resistance}} (Ars) efflux pumps {{of bacteria}} may consist of two proteins, ArsB (TC# 2.A.45.1.1; the integral membrane constituent with twelve transmembrane spanners) and ArsA (TC# 3.A.4.1.1; the ATP-hydrolyzing, transport energizing subunit, {{as for the}} chromosomally-encoded E. coli system), or of one protein (just the ArsB integral membrane protein of the plasmid-encoded Staphylococcus system). ArsA proteins have two ATP binding domains and probably arose by a tandem gene duplication event. ArsB proteins all possess twelve transmembrane spanners and may also have arisen by a tandem gene duplication event. Structurally, the Ars pumps resemble ABC-type efflux pumps, {{but there is no}} significant sequence similarity between the Ars and ABC pumps. When only ArsB is present, the system operates by a pmf-dependent mechanism, and consequently belongs in TC subclass 2.A (i.e.,TC# 2.A.45). When ArsA is also present, ATP hydrolysis drives efflux, and consequently the system belongs in TC subclass 3.A (i.e., TC# 3.A.4). ArsB therefore appears twice in the TC system (ArsB and ArsAB) but ArsA appears only once. These pumps actively expel both arsenite and <b>antimonite.</b>|$|E
50|$|The MIP {{family is}} large and diverse, {{possessing}} thousands of members that form transmembrane channels. These channel proteins function in transporting water, small carbohydrates (e.g., glycerol), urea, NH3, CO2, H2O2 and ions by energy-independent mechanisms.

MIP family members are found ubiquitously in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Phylogenetic clustering of the proteins is primarily based according to phylum of the organisms of origin, but one or more clusters are observed for each phylogenetic kingdom (plants, animals, yeast, bacteria and archaea).

Remarkably {{little is known about}} substrate specificity, localization and regulation of Acr 3 proteins. Here, we show that the yeast Acr 3 p mediates not only high-level resistance to arsenite but also moderate tolerance to <b>antimonite.</b> The acr 3 deletion mutant shows increased sensitivity to <b>antimonite.</b> In addition, overexpression of the ACR 3 gene complements <b>antimonite</b> sensitivity of cells lacking the vacuolar ABC transporter Ycf 1 p. Moreover, both <b>antimonite</b> and arsenite induce transcription of the ACR 3 gene resulting in the accumulation of Acr 3 transporter at the plasma membrane. However, <b>antimonite</b> is much weaker inducer of the ACR 3 gene transcription comparing to arsenite. Interestingly, the presence of metalloids does not influence either stability of Acr 3 protein or its intracellular localization suggesting that Acr 3 p is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level.

40|$|Leishmania is a digenetic {{protozoan}} parasite causing leishmaniasis in humans. The differ-ent clinical {{forms of}} leishmaniasis {{are caused by}} more than twenty species of Leishmania that are transmitted by nearly thirty species of phlebotomine sand flies. Pentavalent antimo-nials (such as Pentostam or Glucantime) are the first line drugs for treating leishmaniasis. Recent studies suggest that pentavalent antimony (Sb(V)) acts as a pro-drug, which is con-verted to the more active trivalent form (Sb(III)). However, sensitivity to trivalent antimony varies among different Leishmania species. In general, Leishmania species causing cutane-ous leishmaniasis (CL) are more sensitive to Sb(III) than the species responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Leishmania aquaglyceroporin (AQP 1) facilitates the adventitious pas-sage of <b>antimonite</b> down a concentration gradient. In this study, we show that Leishmania species causing CL accumulate more <b>antimonite,</b> and therefore exhibit higher sensitivity to antimonials, than the species responsible for VL.

40|$|The genome {{sequence}} of Halobacterium sp. strain NRC- 1 encodes genes homologous to {{those responsible for}} conferring resistance to arsenic. These genes occur on both the large extrachromosomal replicon pNRC 100 (arsADRC and arsR 2 M) and on the chromosome (arsB). We studied the role of these ars genes in arsenic resistance genetically by construction of gene knockouts. Deletion of the arsADRC gene cluster in a Halobacterium NRC- 1 Δura 3 strain resulted in increased sensitivity to arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> but not arsenate. In contrast, knockout of the chromosomal arsB gene did not show significantly increased sensitivity to arsenite or arsenate. We also found that knockout of the arsM gene produced sensitivity to arsenite, suggesting a second novel mechanism of arsenic resistance involving a putative arsenite(III) -methyltransferase. These results indicate that Halobacterium sp. strain NRC- 1 contains an arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> extrusion system with significant differences from bacterial counterparts. Deletion analysis was facilitated by an improved method for gene knockouts/replacements in Halobacterium that relies on both selection and counterselection of ura 3 using a uracil dropout medium and 5 -fluoroorotic acid. The arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> resistance elements were shown to be regulated, with resistance to arsenic in the wild type inducible by exposure to a sublethal concentration of the metal.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on the characterisation of selected arsenite, <b>antimonite,</b> and hydroxyantimonate minerals based on their vibrational spectra. A number of natural arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> minerals were studied by single crystal Raman spectroscopy {{in order to determine}} the contribution of bridging and terminal oxygen atoms to the vibrational spectra. A series of natural hydrated antimonate minerals was also compared and contrasted using single crystal Raman spectroscopy to determine the contribution of the isolated antimonate ion. The single crystal data allows each band in the spectrum to be assigned to a symmetry species. The contribution of bridging and terminal oxygen atoms in the case of the arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> minerals was determined by factor group analysis, the results of which are correlated with the observed symmetry species. In certain cases, synthetic analogues of a mineral and/or synthetic compounds isostructural or related to the mineral of interest were also prepared. These synthetic compounds are studied by non-oriented Raman spectroscopy to further aid band assignments of the minerals of interest.

40|$|The arsenate, arsenite, and <b>antimonite</b> {{resistance}} {{region of}} the Staphylococcus xylosus plasmid pSX 267 was subcloned in Staphylococcus carnosus. The sequenced DNA region revealed three consecutive open reading frames, named arsR, arsB, and arsC. Expression studies in Escherichia coli with the bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase-promoter system yielded three polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 8, 000, 35, 000, and 15, 000, which very likely correspond to ArsR, ArsB, and ArsC, respectively. ArsB was distinguished by its overall hydrophobic character, suggesting a membrane association. The arsenate, arsenite, and <b>antimonite</b> resistance was shown to be inducible by all three heavy metal ions. Inactivation of the first gene, arsR, resulted in constitutive expression of resistance. Similar results were obtained with transcriptional fusions of various portions of the ars genes with a lipase reporter gene, indicating a function of ArsR as a negative regulator of a putative promoter in front of arsR. The inactivation of arsR also resulted in reduction of resistance to arsenite and <b>antimonite,</b> while arsenate resistance was unaffected.

The objectives were to: [...] Investigate effective alternatives for the barium and lead-based oxidants currently used, maintaining the use of silicon as fuel [...] Develop easy to use, realistic measurement techniques for burn rates and shock tube ignitability [...] Determine the variables that affect burn rate, and [...] Evaluate alternative processing routes to facilitate intimate mixing of the component powders. Lead chromate and copper <b>antimonite</b> were found to be suitable oxidants for silicon in time delay compositions. They were ignitable by shock tubing, a relatively weak ignition source. The measured burn speeds for these systems showed a bimodal dependence on stoichiometry. Measured burn rates varied between 6 - 28 mm/s. Lead chromate is potentially a suitable alternative to the oxidant currently used in the medium burn rate commercial composition. It burns faster than copper <b>antimonite.</b> The latter is potentially a suitable replacement oxidant for the slow and medium compositions. Antimony trioxide-based compositions exhibited unreliable performance with respect to ignition with shock tubing. The addition of aluminium powder or fumed silica was found to reduce the burn rate. Increasing the silicon particle size (m m) also decreased the burn speed for copper <b>antimonite</b> and lead chromate compositions. Addition of fumed silica improved the flow properties of the lead chromate, copper <b>antimonite</b> and antimony trioxide powders allowing for easier mixing.

40|$|AbstractResistance to arsenical {{compounds}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{as well as}} in a growing number of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is mediated by members of the Acr 3 family of transporters. In yeast cells, it has been clearly shown that Acr 3 p is localized to the plasma membrane and facilitates efflux of trivalent arsenic and antimony. However, until now, the energy dependence and kinetic properties of Acr 3 proteins remained uncharacterized. In this work, we show that arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> uptake into everted membrane vesicles via the yeast Acr 3 transporter is coupled to the electrochemical potential gradient of protons generated by the plasma membrane H+-translocating P-type ATPase. These results strongly indicate that Acr 3 p acts as a metalloid/H+ antiporter. Two differential kinetic assays revealed that Acr 3 p-mediated arsenite/H+ and antimonite/H+ exchange demonstrates Michaelis–Menten-type saturation kinetics characterized by a maximum flux for permeating metalloids. The approximate Km values for arsenite and <b>antimonite</b> transport were the same, suggesting that Acr 3 p exhibits similar low affinity for both metalloids. Nevertheless, the maximal velocity of the transport at saturation concentrations of metalloids was approximately 3 times higher for arsenite than for <b>antimonite.</b> These findings may explain a predominant role of Acr 3 p in conferring arsenite tolerance in S. cerevisiae...|$|E
