5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it is unique and provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

3000|$|In {{a similar}} way, term (1.2) denotes the inter-cell {{material}} handling cost. This cost is incurred whenever consecutive operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same part type are transferred between different cells. For instance, assume that operation k of part type p is processed on machine type m in cell c at time t. If the next operation (i.e., k + 1) of part p is processed on any machine, {{but in another}} cell, then an inter-cell cost is incurred. To decrease this section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> objective function, {{it is better to}} locate two machines having <b>a</b> small <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material flow between each other in different cells rather than those machines having <b>a</b> large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material flow in order to pay the inter-cell material handling cost (IE p [...]) for <b>a</b> smaller <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material flow <b>of</b> parts between different cells.|$|R

The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had {{a higher rate of}} fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E
5|$|The grenade {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the grenade from its casing, it could easily stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the grenade {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the grenade going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grenades.|$|E

In March 1799 <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gunpowder stores were accidentally ignited, causing severe injury {{to one of}} Castors midshipmen. The injured man having been replaced, Captain Gower sailed Castor to Newfoundland in April 1799, but by December that year Castor was on the Spanish coast when she captured the 2-gun privateer Santa Levivate y Aninimus off Oporto on Christmas Day 1799. Captain David Lloyd took command of Castor in 1801, but he was soon succeeded by Captain Bernard Hale who sailed for the West Indies in April 1801. Hale died in 1802; his successor Captain Richard Peacocke continued to command Castor in the West Indies.|$|E
2500|$|Although Newtonian physics made a clear {{distinction}} between weight and mass, the term weight continued to be commonly used when people meant mass.

2500|$|In 1926 Pascual Jordan {{published}} {{the first attempt}} to quantize the electromagnetic field.

He was able to obtain the same fluctuation formula that Einstein had obtained in 1909.

2500|$|Like the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the UVF's {{modus operandi}} {{involved}} assassinations, mass shootings, bombings and kidnappings. It used sub machine-guns, assault rifles, pistols, grenades (including homemade grenades), incendiary bombs, booby trap bombs and car bombs. Referring to its {{activity in the}} early and mid-1970s, journalist Ed Moloney described no-warning pub bombings as the UVF's [...] "forte". Members were trained in bomb-making and it developed home-made explosives. In the late summer and autumn of 1973, the UVF detonated more bombs than the UDA and IRA combined, {{and by the time}} of the group's temporary ceasefire in late November it had been responsible for over 200 explosions that year. However, from 1977 bombs largely disappeared from the UVF's arsenal owing to a lack of explosives and bomb-makers, plus a conscious decision to abandon their use in favour of more contained methods. The UVF did not return to regular bombings until the early 1990s when it obtained <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mining explosive Powergel.|$|E
2500|$|Solid samples can be {{prepared}} {{in a variety of}} ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil Nujol). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind <b>a</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then pressed in a mechanical press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass. [...] A third technique is the [...] "cast film" [...] technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for qualitative analysis. The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20–100µm) film from a solid sample. This {{is one of the most}} important ways of analysing failed plastic products for example because the integrity of the solid is preserved.|$|E
