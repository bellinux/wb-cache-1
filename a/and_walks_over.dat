500|$|Cyrus {{contacted}} Chris Applebaum {{to direct}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", with ideologies for the video already conceived. Her ideas for the video's theme were about [...] "high-gloss, glamorous white trash." [...] She told Applebaum she desired {{to pay tribute to}} one of her favorite films, Grease (1978), and her parents' courting days. Video conception sprang forward with the idea to resemble the scene in Grease where John Travolta sings [...] "Sandy". In the scene, Travolta exits from a car <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to a jungle gym, where he sits on a swing and performs the song as projections are displayed in the background. To render homage to her parents' courting days, Cyrus and Applebaum named a drive-in theater in the video Corral Drive-In after a Kentucky drive-in where Cyrus' parents had a date. [...] "In addition, Miley's mom Tish used to drive '79 black Pontiac Trans Am, Smokey and the Bandit (1977) style, and obviously that's the car that Miley arrives in," [...] Applebaum said.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler, who had previously directed Rihanna videos for [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] and [...] "Shut Up and Drive". The video was shot in Venice, Los Angeles on April 3, 2008. The video begins with Rihanna {{standing in front of}} a black backdrop for the opening of the song. As the first verse starts, the scene is intercut with another of Rihanna looking out the window at her boyfriend and standing behind the front door as he approaches and asks to come in. As Rihanna walks way from the door singing the lyrics [...] "Don't tell me you're sorry cos you're not", the viewer realizes that her boyfriend has perhaps done something wrong and been unfaithful. During the first chorus and second verse, Rihanna is shown in a different outfit, this time sitting in a silver Porsche in a garage. As Rihanna pulls out of the garage and onto the street, her ex-boyfriend walks alongside the car as she drives and begs her to forgive him; she pulls away. For the bridge, Rihanna is shown sitting on a bed as well as in front of the black backdrops as she reads a text message from her ex-boyfriend, who asks to meet her. During the last chorus, Rihanna appears in a different outfit and walks into a lounge, where she puts some clothes on a table and then sits on a sofa. As her ex-boyfriend walks in, the singer gets up <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to the clothes, where she withdraws some matches and strikes one, dropping it on what is made aware to be some of her ex-boyfriend's clothes. As the song comes to and end, Rihanna walks out of the room whilst he tries to put out the fire.|$|E

6000|$|Thus {{the first}} eight-and-forty hours after Mr. Warrington's {{departure}} passed pretty cheerily at Tunbridge Wells, and Friday arrived, when the sermon {{was to be}} delivered which we have seen Mr. Sampson preparing. The company at the Wells were ready enough to listen to it. Sampson {{had a reputation for}} being a most amusing and eloquent preacher; and if there were no breakfast, conjurer, dancing bears, concert going on, the good Wells folk would put up with a sermon. He knew Lady Yarmouth was coming, and what a power she had in the giving of livings and the dispensing of bishoprics, the Defender of the Faith of that day having a remarkable confidence in her ladyship's opinion upon these matters;--and so we may be sure that Mr. Sampson prepared his very best discourse for her hearing. When the Great Man is at home at the Castle, <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to the little country church, in the park, bringing the Duke, the Marquis, and a couple of Cabinet Ministers with him, has it ever been your lot to sit among the congregation, and watch Mr. Trotter the curate and his sermon? He looks anxiously at the Great Pew; he falters as he gives out his text, and thinks, [...] "Ah! perhaps his lordship may give me a living!" [...] Mrs. Trotter and the girls look anxiously at the Great Pew too, and watch the effects of papa's discourse--the well-known favourite discourse--upon the big-wigs assembled. Papa's first nervousness is over: his noble voice clears, warms to his sermon: he kindles: he takes his pocket-handkerchief out: he is coming to that exquisite passage which has made them all cry at the parsonage: he has begun it! Ah! What is that humming noise, which fills the edifice, and causes hob-nailed Melibaeus to grin at smock-frocked Tityrus? It is the Right Honourable Lord Naseby snoring in the pew by the fire! And poor Trotter's visionary mitre disappears with the music.|$|E
50|$|In the 2002 British horror film 28 Days Later, {{the protagonist}} awakes from a coma to find London deserted <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> an eerily empty Westminster Bridge whilst {{looking for signs}} of life.|$|E

50|$|However, {{the two of}} {{them seem}} {{oblivious}} to each other. Kaname turns around to see another woman and waves <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to her. The woman turns out to be Kay herself. As the two disappear, it is revealed that Kaname was just a memory of when her and Kaname were together. She then walks away smiling and the video comes to an end.|$|E

One of Mama's men, is eating while taking guard of Mama's territory while Mama is away. He sees Suri <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to him. They both start fighting, when Mama enters.

She has not seen Legs again, but she meets the others once in a while and they get together to reminisce about the past.|$|E

In this version, Peter returns to the London house years later, finding an adult Wendy. He is deeply hurt when she tells him she has grown up, <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to her own daughter, asleep in bed. His sobbing awakes the little girl, and she introduces herself as Jane.

House diagnoses him as being akinetopsic, unable to see things in motion, a condition which is often accompanied by seizures. The boy suddenly starts to have convulsions, and is admitted to the hospital (much to House's delight).|$|E
50|$|Once {{again he}} hurries {{back to his}} lair, to later be intruded upon by {{soldiers}} and a tank. All of the soldiers open fire on the dragon with automatic weapons, and one fires consecutive rockets at him, causing the beast to lose an arm and leg. The tank then fires a shell directly at his head, causing it to explode. One of the monster's eyes rolls over toward the General, prompting him to casually shoot the eye. With the beast subdued, the General lights a cigar <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to a statue of the creature and a human smiling together, and a look of surprise washes over him as he realizes that the dragon wanted to be friends.|$|E

The video begins with close-ups of Berry driving a vintage car on a moonlit night intercut with shots {{of a woman in}} a white dress running through sparse woodland. After 54 seconds Berry abruptly stops his car and the shot changes to show the woman in white laid on the road in front of his vehicle. Berry leaves his car <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to the woman who appears dazed. The next shot features the woman resting her head on Berry's shoulder while he drives.|$|E
50|$|Kryten and Cat {{eventually}} {{discover the}} crashed Starbug on the icy planet {{and come to}} the rescue. Holly then informs them that there weren't actually any black holes at all. They were five specks of grit on the scanner-scope. Unamused, Rimmer then tells Kryten the great sacrifice that Lister made and how they grew closer. Just then Lister comes back in, looking at the floor, <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to the locker. He opens the locker, takes out his guitar and exits. Rimmer now realises what has happened and when Kryten opens the camphor wood chest there is clearly a guitar shaped hole at the back. He then tells Kryten to grab a hacksaw, saying they're going to do to Lister 'What Alexander the Great once did to me...'.|$|E
5000|$|The video {{consists}} of the band playing at a cabaret bar, with alternate scenes of a man dressed in black (the devil) surrounded by a funnel cloud heading to the bar while causing destruction to a newsstand and a picnic on the way. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the man lays a contract on one of the tables. Lead singer Ben Kowalewicz leaves the stage <b>and</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to the table. The man holds out a pen, which Ben takes and uses to sign the contract (in essence, selling his soul to the devil). Ben then glances up at the camera, revealing that his eyes, normally light brown in colour, have become blood-red. During the final chorus, the funnel cloud is now surrounding Ben as he and the band finish the song while the man watches.|$|E
6000|$|The youth {{sank back}} again baffled by this all-inclosing acceptance. [...] "What {{do you intend}} to do to-day?" [...] he asked, as she rose <b>and</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the little walnut table.|$|R
