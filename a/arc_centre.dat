40|$|It {{has always}} been {{standard}} practice for protagonists in screenplays to develop {{over the course of}} the story. The character development is even more significant in character <b>arc</b> <b>centred</b> stories, in which the protagonist is expected to complete some form of transformation by the end of the final act. This is especially true in coming-of-age stories, and more recently in minimalist science fiction screenplays which often use science fiction elements as a platform to explore the protagonist's inner conflict. My exegesis is an examination of the character <b>arc</b> <b>centred</b> screenplay, specifically focusing on the structure of character driven stories. The research will be an investigation of how the action and relationship lines in a screenplay are constructed to emphasise the character arc line. I have written a science fiction drama screenplay, Feelers, to explore this research topic. Feelers follows the story of Blake, a young woman who is unwilling to let go of her clearly uncommitted boyfriend. In a desperate attempt to earn enough money to join him overseas, Blake takes a job as a Feeler, absorbing the emotions of a middle aged housewife. Blake soon develops romantic feelings towards her employer's husband, Greg, and finds herself on the familiar path to codependency. The exegesis reports on: the difficulty of preventing Blake and Greg's relationship from stealing the focus of the screenplay, the classic coming-of-age story techniques I used to illustrate the protagonist's transformation, and the danger of commencing the writing process with an ambiguous character arc...|$|R
