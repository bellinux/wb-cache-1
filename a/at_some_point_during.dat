5|$|Amateur bird enthusiasts (called birdwatchers, twitchers or, more commonly, birders) {{number in}} the millions. Many homeowners erect bird feeders near their homes to attract various species. Bird feeding {{has grown into a}} multimillion-dollar industry; for example, an {{estimated}} 75% of households in Britain provide food for birds <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the winter.|$|E
5|$|Between 4% and 7% {{of people}} have heel pain {{at any given time}} and about 80% of these cases are due to plantar fasciitis. Approximately 10% {{of people have}} the {{disorder}} <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> their life. It becomes more common with age. It is unclear if one sex is more affected than the other.|$|E

5|$|Its {{impedance}} is 1.8ohms at 20kHz, to over 60ohms at 150Hz, and its load {{is highly}} capacitive. It does not consume {{large amounts of}} power {{so much as it}} feeds it back to the amplifier in opposition <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> each cycle. This is very demanding on amplifiers' stability.|$|R
5|$|Kaganovichs radar suite is unknown, but it {{is likely}} she was {{equipped}} {{with a mix of}} Soviet and British and American Lend-Lease radars. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the 1950s her radars were replaced by modern Soviet-built radars; Gyuys for air search, Rif for surface search, Zalp for main-armament gunnery and Yakor for anti-aircraft gunnery.|$|E
5|$|There are 43 {{uninhabited}} Inner Hebrides with an area {{greater than}} 30 hectares (approximately 74 acres). Records {{for the last}} date of settlement for the smaller uninhabited islands are incomplete, {{but most of the}} islands listed here would have been inhabited <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the Neolithic, Iron Age, Early Historic or Norse periods.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the island, {{domestic}} {{flights and}} train service was cancelled. At the northern port of Ilan, about 60fishing boats were lost. Three fishermen were rescued after their boat capsized. A total of 168,000people lost power <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the storm's passage, though by October 27 power was restored {{to all but}} 88,000. Overall, 42people were killed nationwide.|$|E

50|$|The 2009 South Sydney Rabbitohs {{season in}} Australian rugby league was the 100th in the club's history. They {{competed in the}} NRL's 2009 Telstra Premiership, and despite being in 1st {{position}} <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the year and scoring over 500 points in a season for the first time, they finished 10th out of 16 teams and so failed to reach the play-offs.|$|R
50|$|Bono {{sustained}} a second injury on 20 September 1987 during a concert at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. {{on the third}} leg of the tour. He fell off the rain-slicked stage and dislocated his arm. He completed the performance and had his arm popped back into place after its conclusion. His arm was in a sling for twelve shows between 22 September and 20 October, which is visible <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the 1988 film Rattle and Hum.|$|R
5|$|Asama was {{reclassified}} as {{a training}} ship in 1942 {{and became a}} gunnery training ship later that year. She was disarmed <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the war, only retaining several 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns. The ship survived the war intact and she and Tokiwa were stricken from the navy list in November 1945. Asama was scrapped in 1946–47 while Tokiwa was refloated in 1947 and scrapped that same year.|$|E
5|$|Asama was {{reclassified}} as {{a training}} ship in July 1942 and was towed to Shimonoseki 5 August 1942 where {{she became a}} gunnery training ship. She was disarmed <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the Pacific War, only retaining several 8cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft guns, and she was stricken from the navy list on 30 November 1945. The ship was scrapped at the Innoshima shipyard of the Hitachi Zosen Corporation from 15 August 1946 to 25 March 1947.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 {{with the help of}} Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E

50|$|During the Siege of Budapest, the {{hospital}} handled the wounded and dead. Bodies were sent out of {{the hospital}} at night and buried in bomb craters. The hospital was without food or medicine <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the siege, with staff having to recycle supplies by taking them from corpses and sterilizing them before reuse. Eventually, horses were brought in and killed for food. The hospital was designed to treat 60 - 70 patients, but at one point was being used to treat 600 wounded soldiers.|$|R

Some stations ran the format full-time 24/7 while a few others ran it on overnights only. Many member stations, however, generally {{break away from the}} program feed <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the day to air some local programming, either a local morning show, a local afternoon show, or both; Cumulus also offered Imus in the Morning for The True Oldies Channel affiliates.|$|R
5|$|Cecil Brown’s {{political}} career spanned nearly 40 years (1876–1913). He {{was engaged in}} politics under four constitutions of the Kingdom of Hawaii prior to annexation by the United States: 1840, 1852, 1864, and 1887, and a constitution for the Republic of Hawaii (of which Brown {{was one of the}} framers) that was adopted on July 4, 1894. The last three constitutions (1864, 1887, and 1894) were each in effect <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> Cecil Brown’s career in public service.|$|E
5|$|Hardy often {{acted as}} a scout who would help bring {{supplies}} to troops on the front line. On September 25, 1918, he {{was present at the}} Meuse River during a mustard gas attack and, <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the war, he received an injury to his knee. Hardy rarely spoke about the fighting itself, and preferred to talk about France's weather when asked about his experiences overseas.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Bédel Bokassa {{served as}} a de facto head of state (and also reigned as Emperor from 1976–1979), while David Dacko (who served as de facto head of state from 1979–1981), André Kolingba, Ange-Félix Patassé, and François Bozizé were elected into office <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> their tenure. To date, Kolingba is the only former head of state of the Central African Republic to voluntarily step down from the office through a {{democratic}} process, following the 1993 general election.|$|E
50|$|The headroll is a trick {{involving}} rolling {{an object}} or prop, typically a ball, {{around on the}} juggler's head. The most commonly performed version is rolling a ball from temple to temple, across the forehead. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the trick, the object may be balanced in place at a certain location on the head. Points where the prop may be balanced (also known as placement, or trap) include: the temple, {{the center of the}} forehead, the back of the neck, the eye socket, the mouth, and the most difficult; the top of the head.|$|R
5000|$|The modules {{were called}} Flip-Chips because early {{versions}} {{of some of}} these modules, for example, the R107 module shown, used hybrid integrated circuits built using flip chip mounting of individual diode chips on a ceramic substrate. Some boards containing flip chip modules were etched and drilled to allow those modules to be replaced by discrete components. [...] <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> production, conventional discrete components may have replaced these flip-chip devices, but the early use of hybrid integrated circuits allowed DEC to market the PDP-8 as an integrated circuit computer.|$|R
50|$|On February 25, 2012 Alexander {{moved up}} to welterweight {{and put on a}} {{dominating}} performance against highly regarded and hard-charging Marcos Maidana. Alexander landed the right hook at will, catching Maidana with his left hand down throughout the contest. Maidana was seemingly surprised by both the speed and power Alexander displayed at his first fight at welterweight. Only one of the three judges had Maidana winning a round. The impressive nature of the win earned Alexander a title match with Randall Bailey in September 2012. Alexander was criticized by some however, for fighting illegally <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the fight.|$|R
5|$|Of the 20storms {{during the}} season, 11 {{attained}} hurricane status. Six {{of those were}} major hurricanes, with sustained winds of over 111mph (179km/h). Two of the hurricanes reached winds of , which is a Category 5the highest of 5 on the modern Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The season produced several deadly storms, with eight storms killing more than 20people. All but 3 of the 20known storms affected land <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> their durations.|$|E
5|$|Stellar {{encounters}} are {{not very}} common in the disk of the Milky Way, where the Sun is, but in the dense core of globular clusters they occur frequently. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the 10 billion years, the neutron star {{is thought to have}} encountered and captured the host star of the planet into a tight orbit, probably losing a previous companion star in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of silk originates in China in the Neolithic (Yangshao culture, 4th millennium BCE). Silk remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> the later {{half of the}} first millennium BCE. China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not confined to clothing, silk was also used {{for a number of}} other applications, including writing, and the color of silk worn was an important guide of social class during the Tang Dynasty.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of each level the player is {{informed}} who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested.|$|R

50|$|The {{stage is}} 30 feet in {{diameter}} and completely round, exposed to the audience on all sides. An unusual feature of the theater is that the entire stage can turn through four complete revolutions at a speed of up to 0.5 rpm, thus allowing everyone in the audience to see {{every part of the}} stage <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> a performance. None of the 2650 seats in the theater is more than 70 feet from the stage. The theater is equipped with an orchestra pit and can be reconfigured as a proscenium stage if necessary, although this reduces the seating capacity by 25% to 50%, depending on configuration.|$|R
5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club {{studbook}}, Old Jock was bred <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> 1859 {{either by}} Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan {{who at the}} time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, Their Points, Selection, And Show Preparation that Old Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>during</b> his {{campaigns in}} Thessaly, Philip {{captured}} the strategic port of Pagasae, {{which was in}} effect the port of Pherae. It is unclear whether this was during {{the first or second}} campaign; both Buckler and Cawkwell suggest that it took place in the second campaign, before the Battle of Crocus Field. By taking Pagasae, it is possible that Philip prevented Pherae from being reinforced by sea during his second campaign. Buckler suggests that Philip had learnt his lesson from the previous campaign, and intended to cut Pherae off from outside help before attacking it.|$|E
50|$|Since {{it could}} not decide how to apply that {{standard}} to Ortega's case as the record at that time did not establish whether the entry into Ortega's office had been for search purposes or not, the majority remanded {{the case to the}} district court. Eleven more years of litigation followed. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> it Ortega had to represent himself, and the Court itself had taken the unusual step of inviting Joel Klein to argue Ortega's case before them. It went {{back and forth between the}} district and appellate courts twice. Ortega finally prevailed after a jury trial in the late 1990s, and the Ninth Circuit denied Ortega's superiors their appeal.|$|R
50|$|After {{his death}} in 1316 his body was entombed {{at the back of}} the crypt in Glasgow Cathedral where he was Bishop for much of his life. The tomb is unlabelled and has been defaced <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> {{probably}} <b>during</b> the Reformation.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2005, filling of the {{reservoir}} {{has led to}} the reduced flow of Bhagirathi water from the normal [...] to a mere [...] This reduction has been central to local protest against the dam, since the Bhagirathi is considered part of the sacred Ganges whose waters are crucial to Hindu beliefs. <b>At</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> <b>during</b> the year, the tampering with Bhagirathi waters means this tributary stops flowing. This has created resentment among many Hindus, who claim that the sanctity of the Ganges has been compromised for the generation of electricity. Though the officials say that when {{the reservoir}} is filled to its maximum capacity the flow of the river will again become normal. In spite of concerns and protestation, operation of the Tehri Dam continues.|$|R
