5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the ice for a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals <b>against</b> <b>in</b> 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Edwin Ekiring was {{the sole}} {{representative}} for Uganda in the men's singles for Badminton. He was 28 {{years old and had}} competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Ekiring qualified for the Games because he was granted the automatic qualification slot for one player in the African continent partly due to him being placed 98 in the BWF World Ranking in May 2012. He said that his experiences in previous Olympic Games would aid him in progressing up the world rankings. On 28 July, Ekiring played against Brice Leverdez of France in the group stage, whom he lost <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the first round 12–21 and was defeated by his opponment 11–21 in the second round in a 26-minute match. Ekiring's next game was against Hong Kong's Wong Wing Ki two days later whom he lost <b>against</b> <b>in</b> a 26-minute match, scoring ten points while his opponent reached 21 points. He was also defeated in his second round match with a 13-point deficit to Wing Ki and, therefore, he was eliminated from the competition.|$|E

The Indian Election Commission ruled out early elections, citing the prevailing law and order situation, a decision the union government unsuccessfully appealed <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the Supreme Court. Elections were held in December and Modi returned to power.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended <b>against.</b> <b>In</b> this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} Procopius in the De Bello Gothico (the section of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, {{which may have been}} voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis (Serbia) and Singidunum (Belgrade). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to set them <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|After placing {{second in}} the 2016 Ballon d'Or, on 9 January 2017 Messi also {{finished}} in second place – behind Cristiano Ronaldo once again – in the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player Award.

In his next league match, on 14 January, Messi scored in a 5–0 win against Las Palmas; with this goal, he equalled Raúl's record for the most number of teams scored <b>against</b> <b>in</b> La Liga (35). On 4 February, Messi scored his 27th free-kick for Barcelona in a 3–0 home win over Athletic Bilbao in the league, overtaking Koeman as the club's all-time top-scorer from free-kicks.

5|$|In 64 emperor Nero {{appointed}} Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically discriminated <b>against</b> <b>in</b> {{favour of}} the Greek {{population of the}} region. Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem {{under the guise of}} imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. Appalled at the treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews, but not only did he refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice herself was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city. Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Pogba {{was named}} by The Guardian {{as one of}} the ten most {{promising}} young players in Europe. On 20 February, Pogba scored his first goal in UEFA club competitions as Juventus defeated Trabzonspor 2–0 at home in the first leg of the round of 32 of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. On 14 April, Pogba produced an assist in Juventus's 2–0 win over Udinese, the same team that Pogba scored two magnificent goals <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the previous season. Later that week, Pogba scored the only goal in Juventus's 1–0 win over Bologna. Pogba was also named the man of the match for his performance. Pogba would prove to be a key player for the club that season, breaking into the starting line-up, and making more appearances (51) for the club than any other player across all competitions that season, also scoring 9 goals. He finished the season by winning his second consecutive Serie A title under manager Antonio Conte, and reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League.|$|E

5|$|The CL had {{situational}} playoff scenarios {{written into}} its bylaws that required either a tie {{in the standings}} or a team with more wins finishing with a worse winning percentage than the top team, but a permanent playoff plan had never been created. In March 2006, encouraged {{by the success of}} the PL's playoff series, CL officials announced their intention to introduce postseason playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. During meetings held later that year, PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system. Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004, the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record. The PL disapproved of the CL's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first-place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the Japan Series, as the PL had been awarding its pennant to its playoff champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is a recurring theme in Müller's writing. Historically, Germans were recruited by the Austria-Hungary to repopulate southern areas following the expulsion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. They were given special privileges, allowed to keep their language and Roman Catholicism, even in areas in which the Orthodox Church was paramount. Their communities spoke German into the 20th century. They were among ethnic Germans, or Volksdeutsche, whom Adolph Hitler proposed to unite in a greater Germany. Millions of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe after the war; thousands were forced into labor camps. Even years later, they were often discriminated <b>against</b> <b>in</b> Romania under the communist government.|$|E
5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise <b>against</b> <b>in</b> the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to get him out on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at Test level at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E
