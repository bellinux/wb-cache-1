CSS 1 support was enhanced and the internationalized version was also updated. Between the two beta-3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the Amaya browser. Beta-3 was the last involvement of the W3C {{in the development of}} Arena. On 17 February 1997, Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing the browser.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Riverkeeper was alerted of a sewage leak in the kill, noting {{high levels}} of {{bacteria}} indicating the presence of fecal matter. A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) investigation found nearby private sewer pipes and manholes {{to be filled with}} sludge; they were cleaned and plans have been instated to ensure that sewers would stay clear henceforth. An oil spill was observed in the kill in 2016 <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> staff were again sent to respond. The DEC installed booms to absorb the oil and began an investigation into the spill's source, which was unknown as of December 6.|$|E
5|$|In February 2017, {{the media}} website My Entertainment World stated that Avatar 2 had entered {{production}} and shooting would start on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California {{as the main}} shooting location. Cameron confirmed the upcoming shooting, and that the writing of all four sequels was now complete. The following sequels are expected to start shooting right after Avatar 2 wraps filming. The following month, Cameron revealed that Avatar 2 would not be released in 2018, as originally believed. The sequel release dates were announced as starting on Dec. 18, 2020, for Avatar 2, Dec. 17, 2021 for Avatar 3, Dec. 20, 2024 for Avatar 4, <b>and</b> <b>Dec.</b> 19, 2025 for Avatar 5. In June 2017, Jon Landau stated at the CineEurope conference that principal photography will begin on September 25, 2017.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began to spread out to other schools and employers such as Stanford University <b>and</b> <b>DEC,</b> and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, {{the first}} Interop conference focused on network {{interoperability}} by broader adoption of TCP/IP. The conference {{was founded by}} Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations, such as IBM <b>and</b> <b>DEC,</b> attended the meeting. Interoperability conferences have been held every year since then. Every year from 1985 through 1993, the number of attendees tripled.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} of DEC Alpha-based systems comprised the DEC 3000 AXP series workstations and low-end servers, DEC 4000 AXP series mid-range servers, <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> 7000 AXP and 10000 AXP series high-end servers. The DEC 3000 AXP systems used the same TURBOchannel bus as the previous MIPS-based DECstation models, whereas the 4000 was based on FutureBus+ and the 7000/10000 shared an architecture with corresponding VAX models.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{built on}} the x86 architecture, Gentoo has since been ported to many others. It is officially {{supported}} and considered stable on x86, x86-64, IA-64, PA-RISC, PowerPC, PowerPC 970, SPARC 64-bit, <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> Alpha architectures. It is also officially supported but considered in development state on MIPS, PS3 Cell Processor, System Z/s390, ARM, and SuperH. Official support for 32-bit SPARC hardware has been dropped.|$|E

25|$|The Catskill Center for Conservation and Development <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> {{helped the}} {{communities}} near the fire towers form the Catskill Fire Tower Restoration Project. Volunteers {{in the area}} raised $16,000 through benefit concerts and art exhibits. DEC employees and AmeriCorps volunteers began restoring the tower in 1999, putting in new stairs and a new roof and windows for the cab. After new ironwork was installed, the tower reopened in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Wang made {{inroads into}} IBM <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> {{markets in the}} 1980s, but {{did not have a}} serious impact on IBM's {{mainframe}} market due to self-limiting factors. Even though An Wang wanted to compete with IBM, too many Wang salespeople were incompletely trained on the significant DP capabilities of the VS. In many instances the VS ran smaller enterprises up to about $500 million/year and in larger organizations found use as a gateway to larger corporate mainframes, handling workstation pass-through and massive print services.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, The Observer listed Hill {{as one of}} {{the fifty}} funniest acts in British comedy. In 2005, in a poll to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was voted amongst the Top 50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. In 2007, Hill was voted #5 on Channel 4's hundred {{greatest}} stand ups. On 13 December 2006, Hill won two Highland Spring British Comedy Awards, over the favourites Ant <b>and</b> <b>Dec,</b> which Hill made light of in his acceptance speeches.|$|E

25|$|KOI8-R – 8-bit native Russian {{character}} encoding. Invented in the USSR {{for use on}} Soviet clones of American IBM <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> computers. The Cyrillic characters go in {{the order}} of their Latin counterparts, which allowed the text to remain readable after transmission via a 7-bit line that removed the most significant bit from each byte—the result became a very rough, but readable, Latin transliteration of Cyrillic. Standard encoding of early 1990s for Unix systems and the first Russian Internet encoding.|$|E
25|$|IBM, AT <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> {{were the}} first major {{corporations}} to adopt TCP/IP, despite having competing internal protocols (SNA, XNS, DECNET). In IBM, from 1984, Barry Appelman's group did TCP/IP development. (Appelman later moved to AOL {{to be the head}} of all its development efforts.) They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. At the same time, several smaller companies began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and MS Windows, such as the company FTP Software, and the Wollongong Group. The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Got Talent {{has been}} {{nominated}} {{for a number of}} National Television Awards in the category of 'Most Popular Talent Show' since 2007. But has lost out to its sister shows The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing. Ant <b>and</b> <b>Dec</b> have won the award for 'Most Popular Entertainment Presenters' at the same awards for twelve consecutive years (as of January 2014). Britain's Got Talent has also been nominated for two British Academy Television Awards in 2008, but failed to win any awards. In 2007 and 2008, the show was nominated at the TV Quick and Choice Awards in the 'Best Talent Show' category, losing out to The X Factor and Strictly Come Dancing respectively.|$|E

50|$|Genericity {{facilities}} have existed in high-level languages {{since at least}} the 1970s in languages such as ML, CLU and Ada, and were subsequently adopted by many object-based and object-oriented languages, including BETA, C++, D, Eiffel, Java, <b>and</b> <b>DEC's</b> now defunct Trellis-Owl language.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} of its announcement, Alpha was heralded as an {{architecture}} for the next 25 years. While this was not to be, Alpha has nevertheless had a reasonably long life. The first version, the Alpha 21064 (otherwise known as the EV4) was introduced in November 1992 running at up to 192MHz; a slight shrink of the die (the EV4S, shrunk from 0.75µm to 0.675µm) ran at 200MHz a few months later. The 64-bit processor was a superpipelined and superscalar design, like other RISC designs, but nevertheless outperformed them all <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> touted it as the world's fastest processor. Careful attention to circuit design, a hallmark of the Hudson design team, like a huge centralized clock circuitry, allowed them to run the CPU at higher speeds, even though the microarchitecture was fairly similar to other RISC chips. In comparison, the less expensive Intel Pentium ran at 66MHz when it was launched the following spring.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{the trail}} is served by two parking lots along 23A, both of which require a walk of at least 0.2 mile (400 m) to reach the trailhead at Bastion Falls, just above 23A at {{a bend in the}} road. Due to both the rugged {{surrounding}} terrain and the limitations placed on Forest Preserve land by the state constitution, New York's Department of Transportation (DOT) has been unable to expand the narrow shoulder {{on either side of the}} road, requiring that visitors walk very close to high-speed traffic, including trucks, some of which are in the middle of descending a pronounced grade. The risk of serious accidents is great. Both DOT <b>and</b> <b>DEC</b> have indicated a willingness to develop a solution that will accommodate their concerns, however this has not happened as of 2006. Some hikers try to avoid this by parking near the Laurel House site or at North-South Lake and following the closed route of the former Escarpment Trail; this is equally risky as it is very near the edge of the falls.|$|E
