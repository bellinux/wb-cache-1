50|$|At {{the heart}} of the {{agricultural}} value chain concept is the idea of actors connected along a chain producing and delivering goods to consumers through a sequence of activities. However, this “vertical” chain cannot function in isolation and an important aspect of the value chain approach is that it also considers “horizontal” impacts on the chain, such as input and finance provision, extension support and the general enabling environment. The approach has been found useful, particularly by donors, in that it has resulted in a consideration of <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> impacting on the ability of farmers to access markets profitably, leading to a broader range of chain interventions.

The digester which requires a shared responsibility is more complicated compared to a single-household level digester.

Introduction The demand for Internet based-services from the North American population has caused a very large increase in data traffic and the need to connect a large number of distributed computers to the data network. This is traditionally done with a voice band modem and a dial-up connection from a subscriber to an Internet Service Provider (ISP). However, the increase in the amount of data transferred has created a need for transmission rates exceeding the limit achievable within the voice band. On the other hand, the long hold time associated with Internet connections increases the average duration of a typical phone call and causes equipment congestion. <b>All</b> of <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> have spurred a s [...] ...|$|R

As a reason to construct it, the trading corporation wrote: The development has been lately going in fast pace, not only when talking about population growth, but as well while talking {{about the development of}} the trade and industry businesses. The specifics of Kiev, namely: the distance between the residential districts from the central business district, an insane price of the apartments in the centre and its neighbourhoods, the elongation and hilly position of the city, a predominantly commercial habit of its inhabitants - <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>factors</b> make the question of cheap, fast and safe transportation arise. The Kiev city tram can't answer any of the issues. The tram's drawbacks are widely known, and the reasons they appear is that, in the given conditions, the tram network development is not able {{to keep pace with the}} fast-growing city. An increase in rolling stock on the main lines may cause a slowdown in the street movement, while an increase of speed threatens the safety of people. The only way out of the situation is the transfer from on-ground trams to underground trams, starting from the main streets.

This approach was more nuanced than White’s theory of [...] "unilinear evolution." [...] Steward rejected the 19th-century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of [...] "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way. He argued that different adaptations could be studied through the examination of the specific resources a society exploited, the technology the society relied on to exploit these resources, and the organization of human labour. He further argued that different environments and technologies would require different kinds of adaptations, and that as the resource base or technology changed, so too would a culture. In other words, cultures do not change according to some inner logic, but rather in terms of a changing relationship with a changing environment. Cultures therefore would not pass through the same stages in the same order as they changed—rather, they would change in varying ways and directions.

The water quality of Gurara Dam and Lower Usuma Dam at different depth of the reservoir {{at the peak of the}} dry and rainy season was assessed in order to determine the effects of geology on the water quality, extent of anthropological effect(s) and its Suitability for domestic and industrial purposes. This was done by subjecting 20 water samples from both Dams collected at predetermined depth for comprehensive physicochemical and bacteriological analysis using APHA standard methods of analysis for both rainy and dry seasons. The overall Water quality results were poor for drinking and aquatic, but fair for recreation and livestock, and good for irrigation. These were due to high concentration of COD, BOD, total hardness, turbidity, potassium, magnesium, cadmium, lead and iron. The results of the analysis when compared with the Nigerian standard for drinking water quality and world health organization permissible limits showed that the Gurara Dam and lower Usuma Dam were polluted and that the water was not safe for drinking. The major sources of pollution of the Gurara Dam, Lower Usuma Dam are the dissolution of the host rocks and weathered sediments in the area and the run-off and surface water flows of other water bodies within the catchment area. Anthropogenic activities on these water bodies are numerous such as industries municipal waste, agricultural and urban. <b>All</b> <b>those</b> <b>factor</b> contributed to the run-off that get discharged into the water bodies thereby flows into the Gurara Dam and Lower Usuma Dam through surface water flows processes and deteriorates the water quality.
