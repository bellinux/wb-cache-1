5|$|Construction {{started in}} October 1999, costing NOK140 million. A new south stand was built with <b>a</b> <b>roof,</b> offices and change rooms, while a smaller stand without <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> {{was built to}} the east.

However, the venue {{was not allowed to}} use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches. The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6,100 and standing room for 2,000 spectators. The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001.|$|E
