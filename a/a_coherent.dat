This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>coherent,</b> rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E

5|$|The {{metric system}} was first {{implemented}} during the French Revolution (1790s) {{with just the}} metre and kilogram as standards of length and mass respectively.

40|$|By {{expanding}} the hard aperture function into a finite sum of complex Gaussian functions, some approximate analytical formulae for the cross-spectral density of <b>a</b> partially <b>coherent</b> flattened Gaussian beam (FGB) propagating through apertured aligned and misaligned ABCD optical systems are derived {{based on the}} generalized Collins formula. The results obtained by using the approximate analytical formula are in good agreement with those obtained by using the numerical integral calculation.

5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon.
