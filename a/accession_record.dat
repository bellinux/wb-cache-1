5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Kew and Ryston specimens, a tree called 'Serpentina' was planted in 1897 at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottowa, Canada. Two of the three specimens supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U. montana serpentina (see External links below), now assumed by the Garden to have been 'Camperdownii', may survive in Edinburgh, {{as it was the}} practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant.The Garden, significantly, had no separate <b>accession</b> <b>record</b> for its 'Camperdownii', a sizeable tree by the 1970s but felled by the 1980s, suggesting that {{this was one of the}} three U. montana serpentina sent by Späth in 1902.|$|E
