5|$|At West Point, {{he was an}} {{energetic}} and ambitious cadet, deeply interested in the teachings of Dennis Hart Mahan and the theoretical strategic principles of Antoine-Henri Jomini. His closest friends were aristocratic Southerners such as James Stuart, Dabney Maury, Cadmus Wilcox, and A. P. Hill. These associations gave McClellan what he considered to be <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern mind {{and an understanding of}} the political and military implications of the sectional differences in the United States that led to the Civil War. He graduated in 1846, second in his class of 59 cadets, losing the top position to Charles Seaforth Stewart only because of poor drawing skills. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General John Lavarack, {{again in}} {{succession}} to Rowell, who became Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS). Berryman arrived in Jakarta by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation. Berryman also attempted to find {{out as much as}} possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel Ian MacAlister Stewart. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of Java would be lost.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

5|$|Teaching {{design to}} {{managers}} was pioneered at the London Business School (LBS) in 1976 by Peter Gorb (1926-2013), the first Honorary Fellow of the DMI and a long-standing Fellow of the RSA. Gorb had previously embedded design {{management in the}} Burton Retail Group before joining LBS where he later founded the Design Management Unit in 1982 (in collaboration with Charles Handy) which he led for over 20 years. In 1979 his talk at the RSA entitled Design and its Use by Managers provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, and <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of design as a management resource. Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design Management Unit at LBS, Design Talks (1988) with Eric Schneider and Design Management: Papers from the London Business School (1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design, design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).|$|E
5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and Q fever displayed <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E

40|$|Abstract –There {{exists a}} gap between {{engineering}} and public policy which must be bridged. Engineers are affected by public policy but are seldom involved in setting policy. Those who set the policy frequently do not have <b>a</b> full <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technological issues involved. If engineers do not {{take a more active}} role in <b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> public policy, they will be left to work within the policies set by others who may lack adequate technical skills. If the policy setters do not develop <b>a</b> greater <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technological issues involved they will develop and implement policies that are less than optimal. A course has been developed and offered that brings engineering and political science students together to explore public policy issues. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class, the students have <b>a</b> greater <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other field <b>of</b> study and they are better equipped to develop and implement policy...|$|R

25|$|Many art {{programs}} in Christian institutions consider nudity {{in any form}} to be in conflict with their beliefs, and therefore hire only clothed models for art classes, which may bring into question the completeness of the art education offered.

25|$|Two major {{advances}} {{occurred in}} the late 19th century, which together allowed the transition to modern surgery. <b>An</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery. Antisepsis, which soon gave way to asepsis, reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to a far more acceptable rate than in previous eras. Concurrent with these developments were the significant advances in pharmacology and physiology {{which led to the}} development of general anesthesia and the control of pain.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} Resnais's films among English-language commentators {{has been that}} they are emotionally cold; {{that they are all}} about technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised by a lack of sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded <b>an</b> <b>appreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have been able to make the connection between the film's form and its human dimension.|$|E
