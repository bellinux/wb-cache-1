25|$|Space debris is tracked {{remotely}} {{from the}} ground, and the station crew can be notified. This {{allows for a}} Debris <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Manoeuvre</b> (DAM) to be conducted, which uses thrusters on the Russian Orbital Segment to alter the station's orbital altitude, avoiding the debris. DAMs are not uncommon, taking place if computational models show the debris will approach within a certain threat distance. Eight DAMs had been performed prior to March 2009, the first seven between October 1999 and May 2003. Usually, the orbit is raised by one or two kilometres {{by means of an}} increase in orbital velocity of the order of 1m/s. Unusually, there was a lowering of 1.7km on 27 August 2008, the first such lowering for 8 years. There were two DAMs in 2009, on 22 March and 17 July. If a threat from orbital debris is identified too late for a DAM to be safely conducted, the station crew close all the hatches aboard the station and retreat into their Soyuz spacecraft, so that {{they would be able to}} evacuate in the event the station was seriously damaged by the debris. This partial station evacuation has occurred on 13 March 2009, 28 June 2011, 24 March 2012 and 16 June 2015.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} predator detection threshold and antipredator behaviour in noctuoid moths.

Earless moths generally fly less than eared species as a primary defence against predation by bats. For eared moths, however, there is interspecific variation in auditory sensitivity. At the species level, and when controlling for shared evolutionary history, nocturnal flight time and auditory sensitivity were positively correlated in moths, a relationship that most likely reflects selection pressure from aerial-hawking bats. We suggest that species-specific differences in the detection of predator cues are important but often overlooked factors in the evolution and maintenance of antipredator behaviour...|$|R

Our objective was to identify the conditions that lead to <b>avoidance</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> in locomotor trajectories of two walkers. Based on the assumption of a reciprocal interaction, we suggested a mutual variable, the Minimum Predicted Distance (MPD), which emphasises the risk of collision and describes the general collision avoidance behaviour. We concluded that walkers are able to accurately predict crossing distances and to react accordingly. The avoidance is performed with anticipation, i. e., maneuvers are ended time before interaction ended. However, our analysis focused on the mutual aspects of interaction. Future work is still required to investigate the nature of each walker reactions to avoid collision...|$|R
