Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) wastegate actuators. To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing boost. Dual port swing type wastegate actuators and external wastegates generally require electronic boost control although adjustable boost control can also be achieved on both of these with an <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or dual port wastegate, pressure is added to the top control port to increase boost.

40|$|Micro-turbomachinery (MTM) {{implements}} gas bearings in compact {{units of}} enhanced mechanical reliability. Gas bearings, however, have little damping and {{are prone to}} wear during frequent rotor start-up and shut down conditions. Externally pressurized gas bearings provide a simple solution to overcome excessive drag and allowing rub-free operation during transient response events. Some commercial MTM currently implements gas foil bearings, a costly proprietary technology with few, if any, proven reliable predictive design models. The thrust {{of this research is}} to investigate conventional bearings of low cost, easy to manufacture (common materials) and easy to install and align. Flexure pivot tilting pad bearings offer little or no cross-coupled stiffnesses with enhanced rotordynamic stability. These bearings, modified for hydrostatic pressurization, demonstrated superior rotordynamic performance over other simple gas bearing configurations. The test rig comprises of a rigid rotor, 0. 825 kg and 28. 6 mm in diameter, supported on two hybrid flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings, each with four pads and 60 % pivot offset and 0. 6 mm feeding holes. Experimental results show that external pressurization stiffens the gas bearings, increasing the system critical speed while reducing the modal damping. Most importantly, the tests demonstrate that external pressurization is not needed for super critical speed operation. In practice, the supply pressure could be shut off at high speeds with substantial savings in operational efficiency. In addition, controlling the feed pressure while the rotor passes through its critical speeds can eliminate high amplitude motions because of the bearings? inherent little damping. In 2007, the test rig integrates an inexpensive automatic <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> to control the supply pressure into the gas bearings. The measured system dynamic response determines the regulator control scheme with a programmed schedule over a rotor speed region enclosing the system critical speeds. Rotor speed coast-down tests with controlled supply pressure into the bearings demonstrate the effective elimination of large rotor motion amplitudes while crossing the system critical speeds. The simple on-off supply pressure control, i. e. a sudden increase in pressure while approaching a critical speed, is the best since it changes abruptly the bearing stiffness coefficients and moves the system critical speed to a higher speed. A rotordynamic analysis, integrating bearing force coefficients predicted by an existing TRC computational model, forwards critical speeds in agreement with the test results. Predicted rotor synchronous responses for the cases with controlled supply show an excellent correlation with the measured responses. The experiments validate the predictive tools and demonstrate the controllable rotordynamic characteristics of the flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Presentation date: 1992 - 12 - 08 The {{use of the}} {{triaxial}} test to characterize the strength of soils for civil engineering applications is widespread. These tests are typically conducted with confining stresses in excess of 5 psi. To characterize {{the strength of a}} soil located in the upper layers of the subgrade of an aggregate surfaced road it is necessary to conduct {{triaxial test}}s with low confining stresses (5 psi or less). The development of a method for conducting multistage, consolidated undrained (CU) tests at low confining stresses (0. 5 to 5. 0 psi), with back pressure saturation, is presented. Aspects of the test procedure that require special attention are described and recommendations are made including: 1. Compaction of the sample in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide reduces the time and pressure required to complete back pressure saturation. 2. Seepage force related pore pressures develop during sample flooding. Zeroing of the effective stress transducer should be completed prior to sample flooding so that it is certain that zero effective stress conditions are present. 3. Back pressure saturation is simplified by the use of a slave <b>regulator</b> (<b>air</b> loaded <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator)</b> that maintains a nearly constant pressure differential between the cell pressure and the back pressure. 4. The stress path method of interpretation {{is an essential part of}} multistage triaxial testing.

40|$|During {{the left}} {{ventricular}} bypass, {{it is important}} to keep the arterial and atrial pressures at a physiological level to maintain the circulation and at the same time to rest the failing heart (recovery of the failing heart). We have developed a microcomputer based control system for the left ventricular assist pump (LVAP). The control system regulates the arterial and atrial pressures at a physiological level by adjusting the cardiac output of the LVAP. The superior feature of the control system is that it has an indirect measuring system. The arterial and atrial pressures are observed from the careful analysis of pressure in the LVAP air chamber. The assist <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> shows that the <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> at the specific momentary points when a diaphragm begins to move reflects the pressure in proportion to the arterial or atrial pressure. The specific momentary points are monitored by an optical diaphragm position sensor when a diaphragm begins to move at a systolic or diastolic period of LVAP, and the pressures at those points are measured by means of a drive <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> transducer. A microcomputer obtains the indirectly measured arterial and atrial pressures through the A/D converters. The control system regulates the cardiac output of LVAP by adjusting the driving conditions (driving pressure, vacuum pressure, ejection duration, and driving rate) according to the indirectly monitored parameters.
