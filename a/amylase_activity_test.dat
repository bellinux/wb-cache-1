40|$|DNA evidence, linking {{perpetrators}} {{to crime}} scenes, {{is central to}} many legal proceedings. However, crime scene samples often contain extraneous substances that may interfere with the PCR-based forensic analysis, resulting in partial or negative DNA profiles. Extensive DNA purification may remove inhibitors, but involves the risk of DNA loss. In this work, pre-PCR processing was applied to improve the success rate of forensic DNA analysis of “dirty” samples without interfering with {{the composition of the}} samples. An experimental model system was developed to screen for inhibitor-tolerant DNA polymerase-buffer systems. The best-performing polymerases, Bio-X-Act Short, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF, were applied in STR DNA analysis of PCRinhibitory crime scenes samples, i. e. samples that failed to produce complete DNA profiles in routine casework despite containing acceptable levels of DNA. A ranking index, called the forensic DNA profile index (FI), was developed to quantitatively describe DNA profile quality. The application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) to FI values confirmed that the three alternative polymerases significantly improved DNA profile quality for 20 of 32 problematic samples, compared with the standard polymerase AmpliTaq Gold. ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF showed complementary inhibitor-relieving properties. A blend of the two polymerases exhibited tolerance to a broader range of extraneous compounds, improving DNA profile quality in 34 of 42 PCR-inhibitory forensic samples. When used separately, ExTaq HS and PicoMaxx HF improved the results of analysis for 26 and 23 samples, respectively. Apart from their complementarity, synergy between the polymerases was mathematically proven by calculating the geometric mean values of FI and applying ANOVA. In November, 2010, the customised DNA polymerase blend was introduced in routine casework at the Swedish National Laboratory of Forensic Science, increasing the proportion of complete DNA profiles generated from impure samples from 38 % to 87 % for saliva, and from 69 % to 94 % for blood. Many presumed saliva crime scene stains give negative DNA results if presumptive testing is not performed. In this work, <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> <b>testing</b> was evaluated as a tool for saliva screening. No direct correlation was found between <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> and the DNA content of saliva. However, the sensitivity of the developed swab screening procedure (positive results for 0. 5 μL of dried saliva) makes it applicable in cases where the number of DNA analyses is limited due to cost...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of stage of growth and environmental conditions upon the <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> in wheat varieties.

And then five types of change with the development of stage were recognized. (2) It was found that there was the daily change of <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> in wheat seedlings, and this daily change curve showed the two peaks and the unique curve according to the variety. (3) <b>Amylase</b> <b>activity</b> in seedlings grown under three different temperature conditions in the phytotron with day and night temperatures controlled at 25 ～ 20, 20 - 15 and 15 - 43 ℃ respectively, was measured using two wheat varieties belonging to cold-hardy and non-hardy varieties. <b>Amylase</b> <b>activity</b> was higher in all seedlings grown at the higher temperature ranges, the hardy variety always had higher activity than the nonhardy variety. There was an increase in the <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> of seedlings stored in a refrigerator at - 5 ℃ and the rate of increase in hardy variety was higher than that in the non-hardy variety.

30|$|According to {{the present}} study, strain ALA 4 showed maximum <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> at pH 8, and {{decreased}} significantly at lower and higher pH values. Similar observations were reported by Hasan et al. (2017) too. The reduction in <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> after altering the pH of the culture medium {{might be due to}} the denaturation or inactivation of proteins. On the other hand, the optimum temperature for the increased <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> of strain ALA 4 was found to be 42  °C. Further increment in the temperature showed reduction in the <b>amylase</b> <b>activity,</b> suggesting susceptibility of strain ALA 4 at higher temperature. In fact, alteration in the incubation temperature affects the bacterial biomass, thereby causing change in the amylase yield. In the line of our findings, Das et al. (2004) reported more or less similar results, demonstrating the temperature range of 35 – 45  °C for the production of amylase by Bacillus sp. In the present investigation, the inoculum level had no influence towards the enhancement of amylase yield. The <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> was found to be decreased at higher inoculum level of strain ALA 4. This might be due to the rapid growth of bacteria and rapid utilization of available nutrient sources in the initial stages. Similar observation was reported by Dash et al. (2015) as well. Moisture is one of the crucial parameters that strongly influence the enzyme yield from bacteria under SSF. In this context, strain ALA 4 revealed maximum <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> at 100 % moisture content. A significant reduction in the <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> of strain ALA 4 was recorded at lower and above the optimum moisture content. This might be mainly due to the lower degree of goat dung swelling at low moisture content, thereby affecting amylase yield drastically. In general, the enzyme yield is influenced by the bacteria and substrate used under SSF (Prakasham et al. 2005).|$|R

The formation of this precipitate in the test, and its removal, diminish lactescence due to Ii-pemia, an effect that cannot be matched by any manipu...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus type 1 is an au-toimmune disease of pancreatic ß-cells {{with a certain}} genetic predisposition that is not yet clear. In spite of the confirmed association of {{diabetes mellitus}} type 1 with several HLA hap-lotypes it is considered that other loci must be involved for total genetic susceptibility to the disease. The relationship of insulin deficiency and decreased pancreatic <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> suggests that insulin itself is a direct activator of amylase gene expression. Endocrine pancreatic function was monitored by the indirect non-invasive method of urinary pancreatic <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> determination (expressed in percentage of total <b>amylase</b> <b>activity)</b> in diabetic children, their parents, healthy sisters and brothers, and in a separate group of women with diabetes type 1 of over 20 years duration. The incidence of hereditary amylase polymorphism variants in these subjects was also ascertained. Decreased pancreatic <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> in urine (under 58 %) {{was found to be}} a characteristic trait in diabetics, and a sus-ceptibility trait in asymptomatic family members. Normal pan-creatic <b>amylase</b> <b>activity</b> (66. 7 ± 5. 4 %) is rare in diabetic pa-tients type 1, but may be seen as a favourable prognostic trait, representing resistance to diabetic complications. The results support the suggestion that hereditary predisposition to the disease is inherited from the father rather than the mother, and that heterozygous amylase polymorphism variants protect their carriers against diabetes mellitus type 1...|$|R
