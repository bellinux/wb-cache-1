500|$|Priestley's son Joseph Priestley Jr. was {{a leading}} member of a {{consortium}} that had purchased 300,000 acres of virgin woodland between the forks of Loyalsock Creek, which they intended to lease or sell in 400-acre plots, with payment deferred to seven <b>annual</b> <b>instalments,</b> with interest. His brothers, William and Henry, bought a 284-acre plot of woodland which they attempted to transform into a farm, later called [...] "Fairhill", felling and uprooting trees, and making lime to sweeten the soil by building their own lime kilns. Henry Priestley died 11 December 1795, possibly of malaria which he may have contracted after landing at New York. Mary Priestley's health, already poor, deteriorated further; although William's wife, Margaret Foulke-Priestley, moved in with the couple to nurse Mary twenty-four hours a day, Mary Priestley died 17 September 1796. Dr Priestley now moved in with his elder son, Joseph Jr., and wife Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley. Thomas Cooper, whose son, Thomas Jr., was living with the Priestleys, was a frequent visitor.|$|E

6000|$|There {{seem to be}} two {{distinct}} ways of answering {{the first of the}} questions I have noted. They do not necessarily contradict each other. Of course the war is being largely paid for immediately out of the accumulated private wealth of the past. We are buying off the [...] "hold-up" [...] of the private owner upon the material and resources we need, and paying in paper money and war loans. This is not in itself an impoverishment of the community. The wealth of individuals is not the wealth of nations; the two things may easily be contradictory when the rich man's wealth consists of land or natural resources or franchises or privileges the use of which he reluctantly yields for high prices. The conversion of held-up land and material into workable and actively used material in exchange for national debt may be indeed a positive increase in the wealth of the community. And what is happening in all the belligerent countries is the taking over of {{more and more of the}} realities of wealth from private hands and, in exchange, the contracting of great masses of debt to private people. The nett tendency is towards the disappearance of a reality holding class and the destruction of realities in warfare, and the appearance of a vast rentier class in its place. At the end of the war much material will be destroyed for evermore, transit, food production and industry will be everywhere enormously socialised, and the country will be liable to pay every year in interest, a sum of money exceeding the entire national expenditure before the war. From the point of view of the state, and disregarding material and moral damages, that annual interest is the <b>annual</b> <b>instalment</b> of the price to be paid for the war.|$|R
60|$|There are no {{precedents}} for the indemnity {{imposed on}} Germany {{under the present}} Treaty; for the money exactions which formed part of the settlement after previous wars have differed in two fundamental respects from this one. The sum demanded has been determinate and has been measured in a lump sum of money; and {{so long as the}} defeated party was meeting the <b>annual</b> <b>instalments</b> of cash no consequential interference was necessary.|$|E

6000|$|A further sum of uncertain, but {{substantial}} amount, {{would go}} to [...] the Irish exchequer from another source, to which we have now to [...] turn. With the proposals for self-government were coupled [...] proposals for a settlement of the land question. The ground-work [...] was an option offered to the landlords of being bought out under [...] {{the terms of the}} Act. The purchaser was to be an Irish state [...] authority, as the organ representing the legislative body. The [...] occupier was to become the proprietor, except in the congested [...] districts, where the state authority was to be the proprietor. The [...] normal price was to be twenty years’ purchase of the net rental. [...] The most important provision, in one sense, was that which [...] recognised the salutary principle that the public credit should [...] not be resorted to on such a scale as this merely for the benefit [...] of a limited number of existing cultivators of the soil, without [...] any direct advantage to the government as representing the [...] community at large. That was effected by making the tenant pay an [...] <b>annual</b> <b>instalment,</b> calculated on the gross rental, while the state [...] authority would repay to the imperial treasury a percentage [...] calculated on the net rental, and the state authority would pocket [...] the difference, estimated to be about 18 per cent. on the sum [...] payable to the selling landlord. How was all this to be secured? [...] Principally, on the annuities paid by the tenants who had [...] purchased their holdings, and if the holdings did not satisfy the [...] charge, then on the revenues of Ireland. All public revenues [...] whatever were to be collected by persons appointed by the Irish [...] government, but these collectors were to pay over all sums that [...] came into their hands to an imperial officer, to be styled a [...] receiver-general. Through him all rents and Irish revenues [...] whatever were to pass, and not a shilling was to be let out for [...] Irish purposes until their obligations to the imperial exchequer [...] had been discharged.|$|R

[12] In A.D. 1825, the Government of Bombay {{received}} {{intelligence that}} a brig from the Mauritius had been seized, plundered, and broken up near Berberah, and {{that part of}} her crew had been barbarously murdered by the Somali. The [...] "Elphinstone" [...] sloop of war (Capt. Greer commanding) was sent to blockade the coast; when her guns opened fire, the people fled with their wives and children, and the spot where a horseman was killed by a cannon ball is still shown on the plain near the town. Through the intervention of El Hajj Sharmarkay, the survivors were recovered; the Somal bound themselves to abstain from future attacks upon English vessels, and also to refund by <b>annual</b> <b>instalments</b> the full amount of plundered property. For the purpose of enforcing the latter stipulation it was resolved that a vessel of war should remain upon the coast until the whole was liquidated. When attempts at evasion occurred, the traffic was stopped by sending all craft outside the guard-ship, and forbidding intercourse with the shore. The [...] "Coote" [...] (Capt. Pepper commanding), the [...] "Palinurus" [...] and the [...] "Tigris," [...] in turn with the [...] "Elphinstone," [...] maintained the blockade through the trading seasons till 1833.

60|$|The {{category}} No. 4, {{brought up}} a member who had made political economy his chief study. This person presented the following case:--According to his calculations, the wrong had been committed precisely sixty-three years, and twenty-six days, and two-thirds of a day ago. For the whole of that long period Leaplow had been troubled with this vexatious question, which had hung like a cloud over the otherwise unimpaired brightness of her political landscape. It {{was time to get}} rid of it. The sum stipulated was just twenty-five millions, to be paid in twenty-five <b>annual</b> <b>instalments,</b> of a million each. Now, he proposed to reduce the instalments to one-half the number, but in no way to change the sum. That point ought to be considered as irrevocably settled. This would diminish the debt one-half. Before the first instalment should become due he would effect a postponement, by diminishing the instalments again to six, referring the time to the latest periods named in the last treaty, and always most sacredly keeping the sums precisely the same. It would be impossible to touch the sums, which, he repeated, ought to be considered as sacred. Before the expiration of the first seven years, a new arrangement might reduce the instalments to two, or even to one--always respecting the sum; and finally, at the proper moment, a treaty could be concluded, declaring {{that there should be no}} instalment at all, reserving the point, that if there HAD been an instalment, Leaplow could never have consented to reduce it below one million. The result would be that in about five-and-twenty years the country would be fairly rid of the matter, and the national character, which it was agreed on all hands was even now as high as it well could be, would probably be raised many degrees higher. The negotiations had commenced in a spirit of compromise; and our character for consistency required that this spirit of compromise should continue to govern our conduct as long as a single farthing remained unpaid.|$|E
