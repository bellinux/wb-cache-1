5|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies {{occurs in}} the western and central parts of the winter range, although some birds occur as far east as Kenya. S. b. woodwardi winters in eastern and southern Africa. Movements in Africa <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> known, although at least some birds return to the same location in subsequent years. There are {{only a handful of}} records of birds recorded in Europe in winter, from Corsica, the UK and Ireland. Spring migration routes <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> known, but appear to lie more directly across the Mediterranean. This warbler has occurred as a vagrant in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Iceland, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, Yemen, Svalbard, Jan Mayen and Madeira.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E

5|$|Although its {{movements}} <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> known, tagging patterns {{indicate that}} the smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past brackish areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish {{were found in the}} Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway—34km (21mi) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas.|$|E
5|$|Antlions <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> {{represented}} in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living relatives {{are thought to be}} the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric curium {{compounds}} <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> soluble {{in common}} solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water {{present in the}} soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in loam soils.|$|E

5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its direction of travel. The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E

The herbal treatments Devil's claw and white willow {{may reduce the}} number of individuals reporting high levels of pain; however, for those taking pain relievers, this difference is not significant. Capsicum, in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast, has been found to reduce pain and increase function.|$|E

Atmospheric americium compounds <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 1,900 times higher concentration of americium inside sandy soil particles than in the water present in the soil pores; an even higher ratio was measured in loam soils.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} patterns <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> characterized. Although some fin {{whales are}} apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring. Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding areas is still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus {{walked with}} an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) <b>are</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E

5|$|Most {{multiple}} sequence alignment methods try {{to minimize}} the number of insertions/deletions (gaps) and, as a consequence, produce compact alignments.
