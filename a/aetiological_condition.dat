40|$|Background and objectives: This second European Federation of Neurological Societies Task Force {{aimed at}} {{updating}} the existing {{evidence about the}} pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain since 2005. Methods: Studies were identified using the Cochrane Database and Medline. Trials were classified according to the <b>aetiological</b> <b>condition.</b> All class I and II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were assessed; lower class studies were considered only in conditions that had no top-level studies. Treatments administered using repeated or single administrations were considered, provided they are feasible in an outpatient setting. Results: Most large RCTs included patients with diabetic polyneuropathies and post-herpetic neuralgia, while {{an increasing number of}} smaller studies explored other conditions. Drugs generally have similar efficacy in various conditions, except in trigeminal neuralgia, chronic radiculopathy and HIV neuropathy, with level A evidence in support of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), pregabalin, gabapentin, tramadol and opioids (in various conditions), duloxetine, venlafaxine, topical lidocaine and capsaicin patches (in restricted conditions). Combination therapy appears useful for TCA-gabapentin and gabapentin-opioids (level A). Conclusions: There are still too few large-scale comparative studies. For future trials, we recommend to assess comorbidities, quality of life, symptoms and signs with standardized tools and attempt to better define responder profiles to specific drug treatments...|$|E
40|$|Neuropathic pain {{treatment}} remains unsatisfactory {{despite a}} substantial {{increase in the number of}} trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the <b>aetiological</b> <b>condition.</b> All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools...|$|E

The authors report two cases in which despite strong evidence for primary psychiatric disorder, on investigation the catitonic state was found to be associated with ureaemic encephalopathy. Since the description of Catatonia by Kahlbaum a century ago, there has been overwhelming evidence for n on-specificity of catatonic signs (Abrams & Taylor, 1976), with seemingly innumerable causes being cited as being responsible. Uraemia is one of them (Gelenberg, 1976).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relative benefit of three interventions (i. e. physiological, behavioural, and pragmatic) designed to facilitate speech recognition software use. Participants were 15 adults with dysarthria associated {{with a variety of}} <b>aetiological</b> <b>conditions,</b> including cerebral palsy, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease, and motor neuron disease. Results suggested no clear dysarthric profile that would preclude at least some degree of speech recognition system use. Participants demonstrated systematic improvement in their dictation rates regardless of treatment order. The physiological treatment produced significantly higher dictation rates overall than the behavioural—but not the pragmatic—treatment. This finding suggests that improvement was not simply a function of software training, at least for the physiological treatment. This conclusion also was supported by changes in the participants 2 ̆ 7 speech production during a post‐treatment assessment...|$|R
40|$|These updated {{guidelines}} on {{the management of}} variceal haemorrhage have been commissioned by the Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) of the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) {{under the auspices of}} the liver section of the BSG. The original guidelines which this document supersedes were written in 2000 and have undergone extensive revision by 13 members of the Guidelines Development Group (GDG). The GDG comprises elected members of the BSG liver section, representation from British Association for the Study of the Liver (BASL) and Liver QuEST, a nursing representative and a patient representative. The quality of evidence and grading of recommendations was appraised using the AGREE II tool. The nature of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients with its complex range of complications makes rigid guidelines inappropriate. These guidelines deal specifically with the management of varices in patients with cirrhosis under the following subheadings: (1) primary prophylaxis; (2) acute variceal haemorrhage; (3) secondary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage; and (4) gastric varices. They are not designed to deal with (1) the management of the underlying liver disease; (2) the management of variceal haemorrhage in children; or (3) variceal haemorrhage from other <b>aetiological</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{spontaneous}} hepatic haemorrhage (SHH) {{is a rare}} {{condition that}} presents acutely to both hepatobiliary and general surgeons. Management of the condition is challenging because of the emergent presentation requiring immediate intervention, the presence of underlying chronic liver disease and the multiple potential underlying <b>aetiological</b> <b>conditions.</b> MethodsA literature search on a spontaneous hepatic haemorrhage was instituted on Medline (1966 – 2014), Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE (1947 – 2014), PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The specific topics of interest were causes – including rare causes, pathophysiological mechanisms and management options. A narrative review was planned from the outset. ResultsAfter 1546 abstracts were reviewed, 74 studies were chosen for inclusion. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the commonest cause of a spontaneous haemorrhage with 10 % of HCC presenting with bleeding. Other causes are benign hepatic lesions (hemangioma, adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, biliary cystadenoma and angiomyelolipoma), malignant hepatic tumours (angiosarcoma, haemangioendothelioma, hepatoblastoma and rhabdoid sarcoma), peliosis hepatis, amyloid, systemic lupus erythematosis, polyarteritis nodosa, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Treatment practice emphasizes arterial embolization to obtain haemostasis with a hepatectomy reserved for tumour bearing patients after staging and assessment of liver function. ConclusionA spontaneous hepatic haemorrhage is an acute presentation of a spectrum of conditions that requires early diagnosis and multidisciplinary management...|$|R
40|$|Youvana pidaka pidaka is a {{distressing}} {{condition that}} affects the majority of adolescents, but the impact of Youvana pidaka on the psychological aspects {{in this age group}} is poorly understood. The present study titled “A clinical study of lepa in Youvana pidaka ” was aimed to observe the efficacy of the trial drug Vachadi lepa in Youvana pidaka. The clinical study was conducted on 40 patients selected randomly. The patients were divided into two groups. Group-A patients were subjected to Vachadi lepa where as group-B patients were given placebo treatment. After dealing with clinical study, observation and results with case discussion was done. In discussion part all the factors and statistical evaluation is given. An attempt was made to explain the efficacy of Vachadi lepa. Among many <b>aetiological</b> factors, unhygienic <b>condition</b> of skin plays an important contributing cause. However age & sex are having major contribution for the manifestation of disease. Out of 40 patients selected for the study, more number of young adults & 12 patients were male and 28 were female. It showed the high rate of occurrence and consciousness of this condition in females. CONCLUSION: Vachadi lepa is more effective in Vata and Kapha Prakrithi individuals...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{pelvic pain}} (CPP) {{is a common}} {{condition}} in women {{that is difficult to}} diagnose. Although heritability estimates have been published for some conditions potentially underlying pelvic pain, the heritability of CPP itself has never been investigated. Using data from 623 MZ and 377 DZ female twin pairs aged 29 - 50 from an Australian twin cohort, we found an increased CPP concordance among MZs compared to DZs, with tetrachoric correlations of 0. 43 (95 % CI: 0. 26 - 0. 58) and 0. 11 (95 % CI: - 0. 16 - 0. 38), respectively. This corresponded to a heritability of 0. 41 (95 % CI: 0. 25 - 0. 56). Lack of correlations with environmental indicators suggested that violation of the equal environments assumption was not responsible for this effect. Multivariate Cholesky decomposition models incorporating CPP and significantly correlated phenotypes showed that the entire CPP heritability could be explained by genetic variance underlying endometriosis (38 %), dysmenorrhoea (23 %), fibroids (24 %), and somatic distress (15 %), the latter a possible indicator of increased nociception. CPP itself is unlikely to be a useful independent phenotype to conduct genetic <b>aetiological</b> studies; contributing <b>conditions</b> such as endometriosis and variation in nociception are likely to provide more useful phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Extrauterine Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma (EESS) is an {{extremely}} rare mesenchymal tumour that simulates other pathologies, and therefore poses a diagnostic challenge. This report outlines a case of EESS arising from the greater omentum mimicking a colonic tumour, with review of literature. Presentation of case: A 47 -year-old woman, with history of hysterectomy for menorrhagia and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), presented with right sided abdominal pain and localized peritonism. On exploratory laparoscopy an omental tumour, suspected to arise from the transverse colon was identified and biopsied. The histological features suggested an EESS. Colonoscopy ruled out colonic lesion. A laparoscopic tumour resection and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was performed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. No additional lesions or associated endometriosis were found. Resection was followed by adjuvant medroxyprogesterone-acetate therapy. Discussion: We reviewed 20 cases of EESS originating from extragenital abdominopelvic organs reported since 1990. Acute presentation is rare, as well as upper abdominal occurrence. Isolated omental involvement was previously reported in only one case. Endometriosis is {{a risk factor for}} development of EESS and history and/or histological evidence for endometriosis is usually present. HRT is another acknowledged risk factor, mostly on the background of endometriosis. To our knowledge, this is the only report of EESS occurring in a woman on HRT treatment without background of endometriosis. Conclusion: EESS can occur without endometriosis and HRT may be an <b>aetiological</b> factor. The <b>condition</b> can mimic a chronic or acute abdominal pathology and laparoscopic core biopsy {{is the best way to}} achieve a diagnosis and formulate management...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 17 {{patients}} with stromal atrophy, hypoperfusion, and microneovascularisation of the iris investigated in the Glaucoma Investigation and Research Unit are described, and their iris angiograms {{were compared with}} those of normal irides of patients in the same age group seen in general clinics. In {{all but one of the}} 17 cases this iris atrophy was associated with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, which appeared to be secondary to the iris changes. The condition was bilateral and presented a typical slit-lamp appearance, with subtle evidence of microneovascularisation. There was neither history nor clinical evidence of previous trauma, heterochromia, or intraocular inflammation. The commonest form of iris atrophy affected the inner third of the iris stroma in a patchy manner, often with sparing above. However, diffuse atrophy occurred in two cases, and there were two cases of 'senile tears' of the iris. Some accompanying atrophy of the pigment epithelium was usual but less prominent. The changes on fluorescein angiography of the iris included the late appearance of dye with a long arteriovenous circulation time, fewer arteries than normal with sectorial hypoperfusion, leakage of dye from the pupil margin and peripupillary neovascularisation, stromal tufts, and sometimes more complex stromal microneovascularisation. An expanded prominent lesser vascular circle was a common feature of the condition. The condition is bilateral and distinct from other forms of iris atrophy. In all cases the iris changes appeared to be secondary to the vascular hypoperfusion and were not consistently associated with evidence of gross vascular disease. All patients had grey (blue) irides, and this may be an <b>aetiological</b> factor. The <b>condition</b> appears common enough to form a significant group of glaucoma patients and to be a separate clinical entity...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is about the politics and the possibilities of aetiology. Firstly, the possibilities. Does an infectious disease have one, single pathogenic cause or many, interacting causes? In the medical microbiological sciences, there is no definitive answer, one way or another, to this question: there, the <b>conditions</b> of <b>aetiological</b> possibility exist in a curious tension. Ever since {{the birth of the}} 'germ theory of disease' and the concomitant birth of the singular <b>aetiological</b> object, these <b>conditions</b> have allowed for the co-existence of a very different, and far less well understood kind of object: the multifactorial object. That SARS was caused by one, singular viral agent, a coronavirus (CoV), is now entrenched as microbiological fact. And yet, the curious thing about SARS is that the history of the 2003 outbreak is littered with moments at which the possibility of the multifactorial object presented itself to, and was actively considered by, medical microbiologists. So how did we get here - to SARS-CoV, an infectious disease that could be understood and storied in this, the most singular of ways? And what happened along the way to deny the multifactorial aetiological object any kind of existence at all? In an attempt to grapple with these questions, the thesis seeks to recover the possibility of the multifactorial object through a deep, ethnomethodological reading of the moments at which it flared up precise/y as a possibility for medical microbiologists investigating the outbreak. What emerges from that recovery operation is a sense that the multifactorial object was never actually ruled out or disproved in any way, but rather, was vanished. Put another way, the suggestion is that various medical microbiological practices and interventions, whilst establishing singularity, were serving, at the same time, to create an illusion of multifactorality's non-existence; an illusion behind which the issue of multifactorality, its possibility, could be discarded without ever having to be resolved, one way or the other. In the closing sections of this thesis a move is made towards suggesting that SARS-Co V, the singular disease, was the product of a choice-, a choice that was made to explore one aetiological possibility at the expense of another. And that is where the politics comes in. For if politics, the realm of the political, can be taken to arise in situations where various possibilities exist but not all possibilities can be chosen, then it follows that what this thesis provides is an opportunity to foreground the politics bound up with the practical doing of aetiology. As a result, and based on the experience of attempting to recover the vanished multifactorial object from the 2003 SARS outbreak, the thesis concludes with an attempt to inhabit the present {{in such a way as}} to make it possible to think, in a little more detail, about where aetiology, as understood by medical microbiologists, might be heading in the future: might recent shifts in practical, everyday, seemingly innocuous microbiological technique, have begun to make it easier to coax the multifactorial object out into a space of visibility? Might those shifts actually herald the crossing of an epistemological threshold in the medical sciences? And might the <b>conditions</b> of <b>aetiological</b> possibility be changing, and changing in ways that would drastically alter what it meant to speak of a 'disease', an 'infection' and a 'pathogen'...|$|R
