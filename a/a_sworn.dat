5|$|Theodore's {{drive into}} Macedonia disquieted another local strongman, Alexius Slav, ruler of Melnik. <b>A</b> <b>sworn</b> enemy of Boril, Alexius had been {{abandoned}} by his erstwhile ally, the Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders (r. 1205–16), who in 1213 allied himself with Bulgaria. Facing a possible attack by Theodore as well, Alexius now preferred to make common cause with him, and married a niece of Theodore's wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by <b>a</b> <b>sworn</b> jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
5|$|Other offices {{included}} the sworn clerks, the examiners, the clerk to the barons, and the clerk to the King's Remembrancer. There were eight sworn clerks, so called {{because they were}} sworn officers of the court, who held their offices for life and worked under the Remembrancer. Each clerk acted as {{an attorney for the}} parties in court, and every party was required to employ one. The first clerk was known as the First Secondary, and administered oaths out of the Red Book of the Exchequer. The sworn clerks were assisted by 24side clerks, of whom each sworn clerk appointed three. Each side clerk studied under <b>a</b> <b>sworn</b> clerk for five years before practising himself, although under the sworn clerk's name. A side clerk had the chance of being promoted to sworn clerk, first by the Remembrancer and then by the sworn clerks themselves. The examiners were tasked with supervising depositions of witnesses, bringing the witness to a Baron, administering the oath and keeping the files of the depositions. In 1624 it was decided these examiners should be sworn officers of the court, and from then on each Baron had an examiner, who acted in the Baron's name. The office of examiner was dissolved in 1841, when the equity jurisdiction of the Exchequer came to an end. In addition to an examiner, each Baron had at least one clerk, who acted as their private secretary; although not paid, they were authorised to take fees for their work. The Chief Baron had two clerks, while the puisne Barons had one each. The King's Remembrancer also employed a clerk, who was also a secretary. He received no salary and was not <b>a</b> <b>sworn</b> officer of the court, meaning the Remembrancer could have him replaced at any time.|$|E

5|$|The next {{incident}} {{proved to}} be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop Liberty arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of Madeira wine. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 pipes of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity. Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo. They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave <b>a</b> <b>sworn</b> statement that nothing had been unloaded.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in <b>a</b> <b>sworn</b> affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E

25|$|Oaths—sworn for the {{purposes}} of business, clientage and service, patronage and protection, state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed to the witness and sanction of deities.

A votum or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.|$|E
