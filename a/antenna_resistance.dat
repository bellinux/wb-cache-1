2500|$|Radio {{waves in}} the {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) band of 30 to 300Hz can penetrate {{to a depth of}} hundreds of meters, allowing them to communicate with submarines at their normal operating depth. The lower the frequency, the longer the wavelength of the radio waves, and transmitters require longer antenna structures to generate them. ELF transmitters use huge antennas called ground dipoles consisting of tens to hundreds of kilometers of overhead cables resembling ordinary power transmission lines. The transmission lines are grounded at the ends, and looping currents deep in the Earth form part of the antenna. Because even these huge antennas are much smaller than the ELF wavelengths, they are extremely inefficient; {{only a tiny fraction of}} the input power is radiated as ELF waves, with the rest dissipated as heat in <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance.</b> At their full input power of 2.6 MW, both US ELF transmitters working together only generated about 8 watts of ELF radiation. This weak signal was able to reach submarines over half the globe only because of the extremely low attenuation of ELF waves of 1–2 dB per 1000 kilometers. ELF transmitters are most efficient when sited over certain low conductivity underground rock formations, which forces the currents to spread deeper through a larger volume of rock, forming a larger [...] "antenna". The US system was located in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan over the Laurentian Shield formation, for that reason.|$|E

Calculations and simulations {{have been carried out}} to study the viability of a CMOS LNA, suitable for satellite receivers, in the current CMOS technology of 65 nm. The used low noise amplifier (LNA) can be represented by a common source transistor (CS), {{based on the work of}} K. Shaeffer and T. Lee [4][5][6]. A common source transistor can be described by four main noise parameters (Gu, Gc, Bc, Rn) and two source parameters (Gs, Bs). The source parameters can be designed such that the minimum noise performance (Fmin) can be reached. An analytical model, based on the four noise parameters, is compared with simulation results. Despite some small differences the predictions of the CS model resemble the simulation model. The model gives design insight and it is used to find the best design for low noise performance. The final and best design for low noise performance, having a noise figure of about 1 dB consists of a common source and cascode transistor together with a gate and drain inductance with a quality factor higher than 10. If a reasonable or good power match is desired an additional source inductance can be added, though the noise performance increases to just above 1 dB. Although previously was found that a non-standard <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance</b> would give better noise performance [12], simulations have shown that a standard 50 resistance gives similar noise performances as a non-standard <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance.</b> A higher power dissipation results in a better noise performance, though a power dissipation of 20 mW can give near-optimal results.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the prototype of an intraocular pressure (IOP) sensor as a major step towards building a device that can be permanently implanted during cataract surgery. The implantation will proceed through an incision of 2 - 3 mm using an injector, during which the complete device must be folded into a cross-section of 2 mm × 1 mm. The device uses radio frequency (RF) for wireless power and data transfer. First, a novel device design is introduced. Materials are chosen systematically for the device fabrication. Two fabrication methods, metal-on-elastomer and solder-filled microchannel, are tested for the antenna fabrication and device integration. Results indicate that an <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance</b> below 5 Ω can be achieved using the solder-filled microchannel method. A device fabrication and integration process based on that method is introduced. A device prototype including an antenna, an RF chip and a pressure sensor is presented. It is assembled on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) with several circuit components used for testing and calibration. The antenna is fabricated and integrated with the circuit using a fabrication method employing solder-filled microchannels embedded in an elastomer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS). The presented method can be used for biocompatible packaging of microsystems and sensors. The prototype is tested for antenna functionality through power and data transfer. The monitoring device is powered at 2. 716 GHz from a distance of 1 - 2 cm. Transferred power is greater than the threshold power required for chip operation. Exposure to RF power is kept below the maximum permissible exposure limit. The backscattered signal is observed in each chip mode to confirm the wireless sensing capability. Structural flexibility of the PDMS-metal-PDMS stack is studied using a mockup device. The effect of applied stress on <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance</b> is monitored in order to evaluate its durability during the implantation process. The flexible antenna can withstand a stress of 33. 4 kPa without any electrical disconnection. It did not show a significant increase in electrical resistance after 50 bending cycles. The prototype has undergone electrical tests for the effect of PDMS coating on pressure sensor and wireless sensing performance. An acceptable increase in sensor capacitance and pressure sensitivity is observed after PDMS coating. Wireless pressure measurement tests showed device operation with a pressure sensitivity of 16. 66 Hz/mm-Hg (0. 125 Hz/Pa). Three topics for future work are proposed for converting the prototype into a complete device. First, additional tests for evaluating device performance in an eye-like environment are proposed.

It is important to keep the antenna away from the plasma and also keep the loading resistance at a certain level in steady-state operation for the various types of plasma. The effect of additional heating and magnetic field strength are also investigated. These results will contribute to the design of new ICRF antennas, the ICRF heating experiment in the LHD, and ICRF heating in future plasma devices...|$|R

30|$|Currently, we are {{establishing}} {{the removal of}} the Lorentz electric field based on the accurate spacecraft velocity and magnetic field vector. We are also conducting a detailed calibration of the spacecraft potentials and electric field taken by the four WPT sensors with the EFD receiver. The qualities of these parameters are affected by the <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance</b> or the effective length of the WPT-S antennas, determined by the balance among photoelectrons, ambient inflow electrons, and electrons fed as the bias current. The photoelectron emissivity and secondary electron yields of WPT-S’s sphere surfaces coated with TiAlN were originally be nonuniform before the launch. (No special cleanliness control was applied to the sphere surface.) They can be degraded after the launch, by a long exposure to atomic oxygen around periapsis and solar EUV emissions. We plan to evaluate the trend of the sphere surface characteristics, including our prelaunch evaluation results of the coating, and present it with the data of Arase’s 1 -year full operation, from April 2017 to March 2018. Antenna characteristics also vary with the ambient electron inflow, which depends on the ambient electron density and temperature and the injection of hot and energetic electrons. The following inter-instrument calibration is now being attempted: (1) spacecraft potential (PWE–EFD)—upper hybrid resonance frequency (PWE–HFA) for electron density calibration, (2) the ratio between electric field waveform (PWE–EFD) and magnetic field waveform (PWE–WFC-B + SCM or MGF) in the low-frequency electromagnetic waves for E/B calibration, (3) the DC electric field (PWE–EFD)—low-temperature particle velocity (LEP-i/e) for the electric field calibration (e.g., Kasaba et al. 2006) if the plasma velocity can be provided with enough quality, and (4) the evaluation of the possible effect from the plasma wakes created by the spacecraft motion (e.g., Miyake et al. 2015).|$|E

In the initial operation from March 2017, ~  19 nA was constantly fed as the bias current to all probes. By the bootstrapping of this feedback loop through EFD’s bias amplifier with a gain of ~  0.99, the effective input impedance of WPT-Pre (DC) can exceed 1 GΩ. Such high impedance is sufficiently larger than the plasma resistance to ambient plasma and enables us to appropriately measure the space plasma potential. The bias current circuit is also used for two calibration signals: (1) The bias current sweep mode, in which the bias current is changed within ±  300  nA during 0.5  s, in order to evaluate the <b>antenna</b> <b>resistance</b> measurement through the evaluation of Langmuir curve as the relation between bias current and probe potential. (2) The voltage calibration mode, in which the bias circuit serves the fixed voltage to the WPT-Pre input through the calibration register (1 MΩ), within the dynamic range of ±  30  V in 256 steps under the disconnection of the loop-back route in the bias amplifier in EWO-EFD. In both cases, the amount of bias current (or calibration signals) can be set separately for the U 1 /V 1 and U 2 /V 2 pairs. (U 1 /V 1 cannot set different values and U 2 /V 2 is same.

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{of the fast}} magnetosonic wave in a tokamak plasma has been investigated at low power, between 10 and 300 watts, {{as a prelude to}} future heating experiments. The attention of the experiments has been focused on the understanding of the coupling between a loop antenna and a plasma-filled cavity. Special emphasis has been given to the measurement of the complex loading impedance of the plasma. The importance of this measurement is that once the complex loading impedance of the plasma is known, a matching network can be designed so that the r. f. generator impedance can be matched to one of the cavity modes, thus delivering maximum power to the plasma. For future heating experiments it will be essential to be able to match the generator impedance to a cavity mode in order to couple the r. f. energy efficiently to the plasma. As a consequence of the complex impedance measurements, it was discovered that the designs of the transmitting antenna and the impedance matching network are both crucial. The losses in the antenna and the matching network must be kept below the plasma loading {{in order to be able}} to detect the complex plasma loading impedance. This is even more important in future heating experiments, because the fundamental basis for efficient heating before any other consideration is to deliver more energy into the plasma than is dissipated in the antenna system. The characteristics of the magnetosonic cavity modes are confirmed by three different methods. First, the cavity modes are observed as voltage maxima at the output of a six-turn receiving probe. Second, they also appear as maxima in the input resistance of the transmitting antenna. Finally, when the real and imaginary parts of the measured complex input impedance of the antenna are plotted in the complex impedance plane, the resulting curves are approximately circles, indicating a resonance phenomenon.
