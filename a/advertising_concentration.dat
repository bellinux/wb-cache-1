The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic, social, and political policies is [...] "manufactured" [...] {{in the public mind}} due to this propaganda. The theory posits that the way in which news is structured (e.g. through <b>advertising,</b> <b>concentration</b> of media ownership, government sourcing) creates an inherent conflict of interest that acts as propaganda for undemocratic forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{anomalous}} inverse concentration-price relationship {{observed by}} some {{researchers in the}} newspaper market {{has been attributed to}} scale economies. In this paper we suggest that the newspaper's (or magazine's) "double-product" feature (i. e., news supplied to readers and advertising space supplied to advertisers) is the main source of this anomaly. In a simple oligopoly model it is shown how a profit-maximizing publisher takes advantage of that feature. Empirically an inverse concentration-price relationship may arise if double-product pricing is not controlled for. Regression results for a cross-section of 222 German Newspapers and magazines corroborate the theoretical implications.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of public Wi-Fi hotspots has brought new business potentials for Wi-Fi networks, which carry {{a significant amount}} of global mobile data traffic today. In this paper, we propose a novel Wi-Fi monetization model for venue owners (VOs) deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, where the VOs can generate revenue by providing two different Wi-Fi access schemes for mobile users (MUs) : (i) the premium access, in which MUs directly pay VOs for their Wi-Fi usage, and (ii) the advertising sponsored access, in which MUs watch advertisements in exchange of the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces to advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share the ADs' payments with the ad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs, MUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ad platform announces its advertising revenue sharing policy. In Stage II, VOs determine the Wi-Fi prices (for MUs) and advertising prices (for ADs). In Stage III, MUs make access choices and ADs purchase advertising spaces. We analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically, and our analysis shows the following useful observations. First, the ad platform's advertising revenue sharing policy in Stage I will affect only the VOs' Wi-Fi prices but not the VOs' advertising prices in Stage II. Second, both the VOs' Wi-Fi prices and advertising prices are non-decreasing in the <b>advertising</b> <b>concentration</b> level and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical results further show that the VOs are capable of generating large revenues through mainly providing one type of Wi-Fi access (the premium access or advertising sponsored access), depending on their <b>advertising</b> <b>concentration</b> levels and MU visiting frequencies.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{investigates the}} long‐run {{relationship}} between advertising expenditure and enplanement (representing {{the number of}} passengers boarding an aircraft), advertising expenditure across carriers, and advertising expenditure and market concentration for the six largest US airlines. Advertising expenditure is evidenced to be strategic, although not clearly effective at increasing enplanement, suggesting collusive behavior. Advertising is also evidenced to be, for the most part, balancing in nature across rival carriers. Further tests suggest a positive and linear relationship with positive bi‐directional causality between <b>advertising</b> and market <b>concentration.</b> This paper’s findings raise three important questions. First, if advertising is not clearly effective at increasing enplanement, then why advertise? Second, if <b>advertising</b> increases market <b>concentration,</b> then shouldn’t airline activities be under some degree of scrutiny, or even be partially regulated?

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{informative}} advertising in creation and augment of market power {{as well as the}} ability of an advertiser to maximize the value of its economic rent. Informative advertising {{is considered to be a}} merit good unlike a persuasive one that is mostly associated with a bad. But analysis of the advertisement breakdown in Ukraine shows that the share of price advertisements, which are the most beneficial for the public, is negligible today. Further still those advertisements are mostly situated in the sectors, where price competition is the least strong. Another kind of informative advertising – differentiating advertising – turns from an instrument of informing consumers into the vehicle of manipulation of consumer choice. Using the blind tests the author has compared the quality and the prices of the range of advertised goods and has found out a low level of correlation between the variables. That means that informative advertising serves a function of informing consumers inefficiently. At the same time phantom differentiation and misleading advertising proliferation as well as informative <b>advertising</b> <b>concentration</b> on experience and credible goods instead search ones testify to effective serving a function of maximizing advertiser welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{advertising}} on sales and market share is complex, {{as are the}} interactions between advertising and {{the environment in which}} it occurs. This study investigates the effect of advertising on sales, including providing unique contributions by quantifying threshold and ceiling levels of advertising effectiveness and providing an understanding of what affects those levels. Specifically, the study considers the effects of familiarity, market share and clutter on advertising effectiveness, and on those thresholds and ceilings, and quantifies the relative importance of each of these factors by combining them into a single model. The determinants of advertising goodwill decay are also considered. The study uses two methodologies: Data Envelopment Analysis and nonlinear regression, on a longitudinal (eight-year) data set of over 6, 000 observations. Findings confirm the existence of ceiling and threshold effects whilst demonstrating the impact of clutter and familiarity. The share-of-voice / share-of-market relationship is re-examined in this context. The findings further demonstrate that the ceilings and thresholds are dependent on the level of clutter and familiarity. These findings extend the existing literature by providing evidence from the field (as opposed to previous laboratory-only studies), and by including several new variables (the Herfindahl Index, a measure of <b>advertising</b> <b>concentration,</b> and the difference between Share-of-Voice and market share) together with variables of clutter, familiarity and lag effects, simultaneously, in a single estimator function...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{intends to}} present mass media, {{specifically}} television, {{as a tool}} for the education of desire for harmonic cooperation, which is a condition for intercultural communication. The main points are basically three: 1) starting from the analysis of the Third Culture construction theory of F. Casmir, and 2) from the analysis of mass communication from the Critical Theory and Cultural Studies, {{as well as of the}} characteristics and effects of neotelevision, 3) a proposal about the mass media, particularly television, {{as a tool for}} the education of desire for harmonic cooperation is elaborated. The paper analyses three of the most important vector processes involved in the profound anthropological mutation of the urban experience: the glocal, dromocrac y and transpolitics processes, along with their derivatives, the glocalization and dromocratisation of individual and collective existence and the transpoliticisation of contemporary social trends. Heterodox modulators of the urban experience that have as yet been little explored by theoretical reflection, these matrix processes, by the fact of taking communication networks and technologies (mass and interactive) as their central premise, can explain three of the most important (and impressive) phenomena related to the city (as a social-historical invention and as bequeathed urbanistic and architectural equipment) and the present experience of the city environment: [1] the reinvention of space in the context of access to communication networks (the fractalised glocalisation of territory), [2] the conversion of the city into passage flows (inasmuch as the traffic of information along networks is mirrored) (urban dromocratisation), and [3] the depopulation of the city's public areas – the prime location of political action and of the collective subject – in favour of new bastions of sociability that are created and decorated by a strong commercial and <b>advertising</b> <b>concentration</b> (transpolitisation of the disinvestment in the inherited social sphere). </p...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{assumed that the}} {{negative}} impact of advertising is the basis from which economic studies in this area are to be undertaken. The authors state that the evidence supporting such a claim is far from obvious. In fact, the suggestion brought forth is that this assumption may be faulty. Specific areas of inquiry are suggested such as the cost of advertising in relation to marketing and manufacturing costs as well as the impact of advertising on GNP. The authors point out that from a demand analysis perspective, the eternal diseconomies in consumption due to advertising as claimed and condemned by economists, is really the result of the consumer's decision making process in the market place. The economists fail to take into account all of the social and psychological forces which impact on consumer behavior. Finally, the authors state that from a supply analysis orientation, no conclusion link has been found between <b>advertising,</b> industrial <b>concentration</b> and market power. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide an {{estimate}} of sunk costs in the U.

After estimating sunk costs, we investigate the relationships between sunk costs and advertising expenditures and sunk costs and concentration in the U. S. brewing industry. Our Empirical results suggest that sunk costs and advertising expenditures have negative relationship from 1950 to 1975, but have high positive relationship during 1976 - 2000. Sunk costs and concentration also have high positive correlation from 1950 to 2000 in the U. S. brewing industry...|$|R

40|$|Executive Summary: We combine data on {{the price}} charged to {{national}} and regional advertising agencies for local radio advertising with data on concentration in local radio markets, creating a panel data set relating the price of <b>advertising</b> to <b>concentration.</b> We employ fixed-effects regression and find that changes in local concentration from 1996 - 2001 explain 3 - 4 % out of the 68 % increase in real advertising rates during this period. Economic growth explains much of the other 65 %. National concentration {{does not appear to}} drive the increase in advertising prices. A greater presence of large national owners in a local market appears to decrease the advertising rates paid by national and regional advertising agencies.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model of}} knowledge sharing and networking among single unit advertising agencies and investigates {{the implications of this}} model in the presence of heterogeneity in agencies’ quality. In a stylized screening model, we show that, under a modest set of assumptions, the separation outcome is a Pareto-undominated Nash equilibrium. That is, high quality agencies locate themselves in a high wage and rent area to sift out low quality agencies and guarantee their network quality. We identify a necessary condition for the separating equilibrium to exist and to reject the pooling equilibrium even in the presence of agglomeration economies from networking. We derive the maximum profit of an agency and show the condition has a directly testable implication in the empirical specification of the agency’s profit function. We use a sample of movers—existing agencies that relocate among urban areas—in order to extract a predetermined measure of their quality prior to relocation. We estimate the parameters of the profit function, using the Census confidential establishment-level data, and show that the necessary condition for separation is met and that there is strong separation and sorting on quality among agencies in their location decisions. <b>Advertising,</b> Agglomeration, Industrial <b>Concentration,</b> Business Services, Discrete Choice, Knowledge Spillovers, Learning, Location Decision, Poisson Regression, Nested Logit, Screening, Separating Equilibrium, Sorting...|$|R
40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of industry by region data the author finds little evidence that U. S. unions have been {{a significant factor in}} the decision of U. S. firms to produce abroad. Additional evidence suggests that U. S. foreign production may have had a negligible effect on the domestic unionization rate. Corresponding with previous research, the results do indicate that comparative advantage, monopoly power, and foreign tariffs are important determinants df U. S. foreign production. The conditions that motivate U. S. corporations to make foreign investments rank among the most studied topics of international economics. Although the abundance of prior research has established a framework for characterizing industries with the greatest propensity for foreign production, several related questions have yet to be answered. Among these is the role of unions. Are unions an identifiably important reason for U. S. firms to undertake foreign investments. There has also been little effort to distinguish between the factors that encourage U. S. firms to invest in developed countries as compared to developing ones. The model used to examine these questions is based on a logical extension of contemporary models of foreign investments combined with greatly improved industry data on U. S. foreign affiliates. The results indicate that unions are not one of the factors motivating foreign expansion. However, consistent with other studies, comparative advantage and monopoly power are found to play major roles. Previous research has identified a number of factors that are likely to encourage U. S. foreign investments including, <b>concentration,</b> <b>advertising,</b> research and development, capital intensity, high average wages, and foreign barriers to imports. Most of these factors were originally found by comparing sample characteristics of transnational or multinational firms with strictly national ones (Dunning, 1973; Caves, 1971). When regression analysis was employed in these early studies, it was often restricted to U. S. investments in particular countries, typically developed ones like Canada and the European Economi...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>advertising</b> {{intensity}} on <b>concentration</b> change in 269 manufacturing industries is investigated in this dissertation. A single-equation regression model was utilized, emphasizing the 1967 - 1982 period. The dependent variable, concentration change, {{is a measure}} of change in the degree of competition. Besides advertising intensity (levels and changes), the other independent variables are initial concentration ratio, industry size, industry growth, and dummy variables for industries categorized as: (1) industries with high research and development spending; (2) convenience good industries; and (3) consumer good industries;The advertising intensity variables were hypothesized to have positive effects on concentration change because: (1) the advertising data source, Leading National Advertisers, mainly consists of national advertising, which tends to be more persuasive than informative; (2) there exist various real and pecuniary scale advantages in advertising; (3) some forms of advertising cost so much (especially network TV) that it creates an absolute cost barrier to entry; (4) large firms benefit by a number of restrictive practices in advertising; (5) there exist a number of advertising characteristics that favor larger firms; and (6) larger firms are the favorite customers of advertising agencies and receive preferential treatment. Furthermore, since these factors apply especially well to network TV, the network TV advertising intensity coefficients were expected to be larger than those for other types of advertising intensities;The regression results supported the above hypotheses; it appears that advertising intensity does have a positive and significant effect on concentration change for 1967 - 1982. The total, electronic (spot and network TV plus network radio) and network TV advertising intensities (levels and changes) were always positive and generally significant at the 1 % or 5 % levels. In particular, as hypothesized, network TV advertising intensity (both levels and changes) generally had larger coefficients than their total or electronic advertising intensity counterparts. And, from the 5 -year subperiod analyses, it appears that the effects of advertising intensity levels (especially for network TV) on concentration change seem to be getting increasingly larger in each successive 5 -year period since 1967...|$|R
