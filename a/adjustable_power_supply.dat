Incoherent mid-infrared images of light emission from a heat lamp bulb with an <b>adjustable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> at window wavelengths ranging from 2. 9 mu m to 3. 5 mu m are used for upconversion. The sum-frequency generation is realized in a laser cavity with the resonant wavelength of 1064 nm pumped by an LD at 806 nm built around a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal. The converted infrared image in the wavelength range similar to 785 nm with a resolution of about 120 x 70 is low-noise detected using a silicon-based camera. By optimizing the system parameters, the upconversion quantum efficiency is predicted to be 28 % for correctly polarized, on-axis and phase-matching light. </p...|$|E
40|$|A DC/DC {{converter}} generally {{needs to}} work under high switching frequency when used as an <b>adjustable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{to reduce the size}} of magnetic elements such as inductors, transformers and capacitors, but with the rising of the switch frequency, the switch losses will increase and the efficiency will reduce. Recently, to solve these problems, research is actively being done on a soft switching method that can be applied under high frequency and on a PWM converter that can be applied under low frequency such as a multi-level topology. In this paper a novel DC-DC conversion method for reducing the ripple of output voltage is proposed. In the proposed converter, buck converters are connected in series to generate the output voltage. By using this method, the ripple of output voltage can be reduced compared to a conventional buck converter. Particularly when output voltage is low, the number of acting switching elements is less and the result of ripple reduction is more obvious. It is expected that the converter proposed in this paper could be very useful in the case of wide-range output voltage...|$|E

In Orleans, an important project “Plasmed” dedicated to the study of therapeutic applications of plasmas in cancerology and dermato-cosmetology, gather together plasma researchers, biologists, medical doctors and partner companies. In a first step, the antitumor effect of plasma treatment has been studied on U 87 glyoblastoma (brain tumor) cells in vitro and in vivo using a pulsed floating electrode DBD plasma reactor driven by an <b>adjustable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> This allows plasma treatments over a wide range of parameters concerning applied voltage and discharge frequency up to one kHz. Bioluminescence (BLI), a gene expression imaging modality that is closely dependant upon metabolism and proliferation, was used to assess cell viability or tumor growth together with MTT assay and by trypan blue assay for in vitro experiments. In that case, 24 -well plates were seeded with U 87 cells previously transfected by the luciferase gene (U 87 -Luc). In vitro plasma induced a decrease of BLI resulting from a massive cell death. Already, very interesting results have been obtained in vivo, showing plasma antitumor effect on human U 87 -Luc on Balb/c nude female mice that were injected sub cutaneously. They indicate that a very substantial delay in tumor grow is initiated for plasma treated tumors compared to non-treated ones. Both in vitro and in vivo data highlight a major antitumor effect of plasma treatment, may be linked to an apoptosis induction. Studies are ongoing to elucidate mechanism of action of plasma in apoptosis induction and to understand the implication of the different plasma components in the cytotoxic effect. In parallel, series of experiments are now performed involving a new type of plasma applicator 1 consisting in plasma gun that allows treatment at long distance from HV discharge. Fraction of millimeter size plasma probe was developed for mouse colon treatment. After a general presentation of the project, we will report on in vitro and in vivo FE DBD experiments concerning U 87 before presenting first results on tolerance study and effect on in vitro cell lines using plasma gun. 1.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} two decades, many teams around the world {{demonstrated}} very interesting applications of non equilibrium cold plasmas in the domains of sterilization and decontamination. Recently, researchers have shown {{that this kind of}} plasmas are of huge interest in medicine, more especially for haemostasis (control of bleeding during surgery), skin diseases, and stomatology. As opposed to thermal plasmas which are employed in medicine for electrocauterization, haemostasis or tissue cutting, non-thermal plasmas have much greater flexibility and can create much more subtle non-lethal effects permitting substantial selectivity in treatment. Our very recent work showed that non equilibrium cold plasmas at atmospheric pressure are clearly also very promising for the treatment of certain types of tumors.

40|$|Thermal comfort, which depends {{mainly on}} {{temperature}} and airflow velocity distributions, {{is an important}} factor to consider when designing modern building energy systems. Up until today, the transient behavior of air flow structures has only been marginally investigated. The goal of this work is to study these structures in more detail, particularly the phenomena linked to the occurrence of free and forced convection. To this purpose an experimental test facility was built to provide new data about the transient behavior of large-scale flow structures in ventilated rooms. The test facility, called the Aachen model room, is 3 ~m high, 4 ~m wide and 5 ~m long. Four heat sources stretching over the whole length on the room are located inside. Each heat source is 5 ~m long, 0. 4 ~m wide and 0. 6 ~m high. The total internal load in the test facility can be varied between 0 ~kW and 6 ~kW by using <b>adjustable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> units. The room facing side of the walls is covered in aluminium foil. The effect of radiation can thus be neglected. Directly below the ceiling, on both sides, slot diffusers are installed over the whole length of the room. Each of the air inlets is one meter long and 20 ~mm high. The supply air can be brought inside either on both or just one side of the test facility. Exhaust air openings are located on floor level on both sides, over the whole length of the room, with the possibility of using just the openings at the back half of the room. The air flow velocity in the room is measured with twelve omnidirectional anemometers in a rectangular grid. The sensors measure the speed of the local velocity vector. The air temperature is measured with twelve platinum resistance thermometers. Each of the twelve temperature and velocity sensors is arranged on a horizontal aluminium profile at a distance of 0. 33 m from each other. The aluminium profile is fixed onto a traversing device. At isothermal boundary conditions {{and in the case of}} mixed convections with dominating forced convection the air flow structure is almost two-dimensional and stable over the whole length of the test facility. If the supply air is brought inside through both inlets two large and stable eddies occur. If the supply air is brought inside the model room on one side only one large and stable eddy is formed. The air flow structure is nearly two-dimensional over the length of the model room. If neither the free convection nor the forced convection dominates, an unstable room air flow structure occurs. The flow structure in the upper part of the model room is dominated by the forced convection from the supply air. The part directly above the heating sources is dominated by free convection. The whole room air flow structure is thus three-dimensional. The turbulence models applied in air flow simulations are based on the assumption of fully turbulent flows. However, it cannot be ruled out that there are areas within an air flow structure in a room which depend on the Reynolds number at the supply air inlet. This experimental setup was also used to provide information on such areas with low air velocities. The minimal supply air velocity required for the assumption that the room air flow structure is independent of the supply air velocity depends on the supply air inlet and the supply air momentum flow. In this study a connection between these factors was observed for the given geometries. The effect of the boundary conditions on the room air flow structure was studied by applying different supply air velocities and different internal loads. Low velocities and high internals loads lead to an unstable room air flow structure. By increasing the supply air velocity, the structure becomes more stable and can be considered two-dimensional over the whole length of the model room. The point where an unstable air flow structure becomes stable is observed at the same Archimedes number for different inlet velocities and internal loads, as long as the supply air and the heating loads are activated over the whole length of the test facility. In the case of a stable room air flow structure, the position of the exhaust opening has no further influence on the structure. Room air flow structures where no domination of forced convection is present do show an influence of the position of the exhaust opening. The room air flow structures are changing by varying the position of the exhaust opening. If only the opening at the back of the room are used, the two previously discussed stable eddies occur only in the back part of the model room, whereas the front part is characterised by a disordered flow structure...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{dynamically}} <b>adjustable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> as {{a method}} to lower power dissipation in DSP is analyzed. Power can be reduced substantially without sacrificing performance in fixed-throughput applications by slowing the clock and lowering supply voltage instead of idling when computational workload varies. This can yield a typical power savings of 30 [...] 50 %. If latency can be tolerated, buffering data and averaging processing rate can yield power reductions of {{an order of magnitude}} in some applications. Continuous variation of the supply voltage can be approximated by very crude quantization and dithering: a fourlevel controller is sufficient to get within a few percent of the optimal power savings. Significant savings are possible only if the voltage can be changed on the same time scale as the variations in workload. A chip has been fabricated and tested to verify the closed-loop functionality of a variable voltage system. The controller takes only 0. 4 mm and draws a maximum of 1 mW at 2 V with a 40 MHz clock.

This paper considers the design and evaluation of transformer-based and transformer less-based variable regulated DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{with the aim of}} presenting a comparative analysis between them; and their respective areas of applications. The quality, cost, size, weight, performance and efficient production of DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> thus pose a great deal of concern and attention in the DC power production of any electronic device. The design methodology used in this work involves Software design for component selection, improved hardware design, computer simulation and evaluation of transformation, rectification, filtration and regulation stages for both transformer-based and transformer less-based <b>adjustable</b> DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with graphical outputs. The results obtained after following the design specification was very satisfactory. The transformer-based has a robust output current and well isolated from the supply voltage, which makes it more suitable for high current application, highly reliable for powering electronics devices while the transformer less based DC source has smaller size, weight and cheaper so as to miniaturize electronics devices but limited to low current devices. It also generates far less noise, heat, input harmonic distortion levels, and higher transient response but lack of proper isolation unlike its counterpart thus result in lower Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). Transformer less variable DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> should be considered a viable option for lower power, small and low current applications where achieving the highest availability is not the top concern and cost, size and weight restrictions inhibit the use of traditional transformer-based DC <b>power</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

While <b>adjustable</b> frequency <b>power</b> <b>supplies</b> may be more attractive for certain loads which operate over a very wide range of speeds, the multiple speed machines are economically more viable in many cases. In addition, the technology base for the design and control of multiple speed machines is opening additional application areas.

These include both the physical aspects of the system incorporating the motor, as well as the economic tradeoffs which must be made to establish whether multiple-speed motors are appropriate. The technology of multiple-speed machines is divided into two principal types, including pole-changing motors and pole amplitude modulation (PAM) motors. In those cases where the efficient load speeds are multiples of two, a pole changing motor may be appropriate, while PAM machines are most favorable for efficient operating speeds which are closer together.
