We aimed at evaluating if moderate exercise training prevents these outcomes. Twenty-three female BALB/c mice (25 – 30 g) were randomly divided in two main groups: control (C) and exercise (E), which were submitted, or not, to 15 min of swimming, 5 days/week during 4 weeks. Then, {{the animals were}} exposed for 1 h to either saline solution (CS or ES) or to a suspension of 8 mg/m 3 of <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> (CA or EA). Twenty-four hours later pulmonary mechanics {{was determined by the}} end-inflation occlusion method. Left lungs were prepared for histology and right lungs for TGF-β determination. Static elastance increased after <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> exposure independently of swimming. In CA group the viscoelastic component of elastance, the viscoelastic/inhomogeneous pressure, the polymorphonuclear amount, the fraction area of alveolar collapse and TGF-β increased. Thus, exercise training may mitigate the pro-inflammatory response to inhaled aluminum refinery dust...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{associations}} between alumina and bauxite dust exposure and cancer incidence and circulatory and respiratory disease mortality among bauxite miners and alumina refinery workers. METHODS: This cohort of 5770 males {{has previously been}} linked to national mortality and national and state cancer incidence registries (1983 - 2002). In this paper, Poisson regression was used to undertake internal comparisons within the cohort based on subgroups of cumulative exposure to inhalable bauxite and <b>alumina</b> <b>dust.</b> Exposure was estimated using job histories and historical air monitoring data. RESULTS: There was no association between ever bauxite exposure and any of the outcomes. There was a borderline significant association between ever alumina exposure and cerebrovascular disease mortality (10 deaths, RR 3. 8, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 13). There was some evidence of an exposure-response relationship between cumulative bauxite exposure and non-malignant respiratory disease mortality (seven deaths, trend p value: 0. 01) and between cumulative alumina exposure and cerebrovascular disease mortality (trend p value: 0. 04). These associations were based on very few cases and for non-malignant respiratory disease the deaths represented a heterogeneous mixture of causes. There {{was no evidence of}} an excess risk for any cancer type with bauxite or alumina exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings, based on very few cases, suggest that cumulative inhalable bauxite exposure may be associated with an excess risk of death from non-malignant respiratory disease and that cumulative inhalable <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> exposure may be associated with an excess risk of death from cerebrovascular disease. Neither exposure appears to increase the risk of incident cancer...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Employees in alumina {{refineries}} {{are known}} to be exposed to a number of potential respiratory irritants, particularly caustic mist and bauxite and <b>alumina</b> <b>dusts.</b> To examine the prevalence of work related respiratory symptoms and lung function in alumina refinery employees and relate these to their jobs.  METHODS— 2964 current employees of three alumina refineries in Western Australia were invited to participate in a cross sectional study, and 89 % responded. Subjects were given a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, smoking, and occupations with additional questions on temporal relations between respiratory symptoms and work. Forced expiratory volume in 1  second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured with a rolling seal spirometer. Atopy was assessed with prick skin tests for common allergens. Associations between work and symptoms were assessed with Cox's regression to estimate prevalence ratios, and between work and lung function with linear regression.  RESULTS—Work related wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and rhinitis were reported by 5. 0 %, 3. 5 %, 2. 5 %, and 9. 5 % of participants respectively. After adjustment for age, smoking, and atopy, most groups of production employees reported a greater prevalence of work related symptoms than did office employees. After adjustment for age, smoking, height, and atopy, subjects reporting work related wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath had significantly lower mean levels of FEV 1 (186,  162, and 272  ml respectively) than subjects without these symptoms. Prevalence of most work related symptoms was higher at refinery 2  than at the other two refineries, but subjects at this refinery had an adjusted mean FEV 1 > 60 ml higher than the others. Significant differences in FVC and FEV 1 /FVC ratio, but not FEV 1, were found between different process groups.  CONCLUSIONS—There were significant differences in work related symptoms and lung function between process groups and refineries, but these were mostly not consistent. Undefined selection factors and underlying population differences may account for some of these findings but workplace exposures may also contribute. The differences identified between groups were unlikely to be clinically of note.    Keywords: aluminium; alumina; bauxite; caustic mist; occupational epidemiolog...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Electrostatic precipitators are high efficiency gas cleaning devices widely used in industry for removing particulates from process gases. A major factor affecting their performance is particle migration, which is governed by the complex interaction of electrical and hydrodynamic phenomena. A fuller understanding of these fundamental mechanisms is therefore essential {{to the development of}} realistic mathematical models. The work described in this thesis concentrates on the fluid-particle interactions in a wire-plate-system. A pilot-scale rig was built using actual components from an industrial precipitator, allowing realistic conditions to be simulated in the laboratory. Hot-wire anemometry and laser-Doppler photon correlation techniques were employed to study the time-averaged velocity field. Several designs of wall strengthener were considered, and in each case the effect on the surrounding flow field was investigated using helium bubble visualisation. The turbulent nature of the fluid was characterised by local dispersion coefficient values and fluctuating velocity components. <b>Alumina</b> test <b>dust</b> in the size range 1 - 10 pm was used in the precipitator under a variety of operating conditions, and a technique was established for extracting representative dust samples. The samples allowed simultaneous measurement of concentration and size distribution, from which concentration profile development and collection efficiency information was obtained. Two alternative numerical models of the precipitator were developed, both incorporating the results from the fluid flow field experimentation. The first approach was based on the finite difference solution of the convective-diffusion equation, using appropriate boundary conditions. In the second approach, the transport of dust down the precipitator duct was simulated by the step-wise progression of a series of vertical line-sources, whose motion was governed by electrical migration and lateral diffusive spread. The validity of the models was tested by comparison of the predicted concentration profiles with corresponding experimental results...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculated}} theoretical evolutionary {{sequences of}} asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, including formation {{and evolution of}} dust grains in their circumstellar envelope. By considering stellar populations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we calculate synthetic colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams, which are compared with those obtained by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The comparison between observations and theoretical predictions outlines that extremely obscured carbon-stars and oxygen-rich sources experiencing hot bottom burning (HBB) occupy well defined, distinct regions in the colour-colour ([3. 6]-[4. 5], [5. 8]-[8. 0]) diagram. The C-rich stars are distributed along a diagonal strip that we interpret as an evolutionary sequence, becoming progressively more obscured as the stellar surface layers enrich in carbon. Their circumstellar envelopes host solid carbon dust grains with size in the range 0. 05 2, are the descendants of stars with initial mass M_in∼ 2. 5 - 3 M_ in the very latest phases of the AGB life. The oxygen-rich stars with the reddest colours ([5. 8]-[8. 0] > 0. 6) are those experiencing HBB, the descendants of ∼ 5 M_ objects formed 10 ^ 8 yr ago; <b>alumina</b> and silicates <b>dust</b> start forming at different distances from the central star.

40|$|The O-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars {{experience}} strong {{mass loss}} with efficient dust condensation {{and they are}} major sources of dust in the interstellar medium. <b>Alumina</b> <b>dust</b> (Al_ 2 O_ 3) is an important dust component in O-rich circumstellar shells and {{it is expected to}} be fairly abundant in the winds of the more massive and O-rich AGB stars. By coupling AGB stellar nucleosynthesis and dust formation, we present a self-consistent exploration on the Al_ 2 O_ 3 production in the winds of AGB stars with progenitor masses between ∼ 3 and 7 M_ and metallicities in the range 0. 0003 < Z < 0. 018. We find that Al_ 2 O_ 3 particles form at radial distances from the centre between ∼ 2 and 4 R_* (depending on metallicity), which is in agreement with recent interferometric observations of Galactic O-rich AGB stars. The mass of Al_ 2 O_ 3 dust is found to scale almost linearly with metallicity, with solar metallicity AGBs producing the highest amount (about 10 ^- 3 M_) of <b>alumina</b> <b>dust.</b> The Al_ 2 O_ 3 grain size decreases with decreasing metallicity (and initial stellar mass) and the maximum size of the Al_ 2 O_ 3 grains is ∼ 0. 075 μ m for the solar metallicity models. Interestingly, the strong depletion of gaseous Al observed in the low-metallicity HBB AGB star HV 2576 seems to be consistent with the formation of Al_ 2 O_ 3 dust as predicted by our models. We suggest that the content of Al may be used as a mass (and evolutionary stage) indicator in AGB stars experiencing HBB. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

40|$|Aims. We {{present the}} results of {{observations}} with interferometers of a sample of pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the infrared and at radio wavelengths. The goal of these observations is to explore the extended stellar atmospheres and to establish links between the spatial scales of molecular envelopes and of the dust shell. This {{is the key to}} better understand the process of dust formation and therefore of mass loss. Methods. We used the ESO VLTI/MIDI interferometer in the N band, the Keck Interferometer in the K band, and NRAO VLBA observations of SiO masers at 7 mm wavelength of a sample of AGB stars: U Ari, W Cnc, RX Tau, RT Tau, RT Aql, S Ser, and V Mon. The various instruments probe different altitudes of the atmosphere of the AGB stars. They are sensitive to regions below the silicate dust condensation distance and provide the opportunity of finding hints about how dust and its precursors form in the extended atmosphere of an AGB star. The K-band observations are sensitive to water and carbon-monoxyde vapors. Unfortunately, we were only able to observe S Ser in this wavelength range. Results. We find a ratio of 2. 2 between the molecular envelope radius and the photospheric size, which is consistent with previous results. The N-band observations are mostly sensitive to vapors of SiO and water and to <b>dust</b> (<b>alumina</b> and silicate). The silicate dust shell is fully resolved, and no precise parameters can be deduced from the N-band observations other than a spatial extension of at least 12 – 16 [*]R⋆ for our sample. The sizes found for the SiO region are consistent with the radii of the SiO maser rings provided by the VLBA observations. The sizes of the alumina and water vapor regions are systematically found to be larger. There is clear evidence that SiO is absent from regions farther from the star where silicate dust condenses. Conclusions. These observations support a possible scenario in which SiO is adsorbed by species such as corundum. An alternative explanation could be that SiO has chemically disappeared at this range of distances...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} bauxite {{mining and}} alumina refining processes and to outline the relevant physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, and psy-chosocial health risks. Methods: Review article. Results: The most impor-tant risks relate to noise, ergonomics, trauma, and caustic soda splashes of the skin/eyes. Other risks of note relate to fatigue, heat, and solar ultraviolet {{and for some}} operations tropical diseases, venomous/dangerous animals, and remote locations. Exposures to bauxite dust, <b>alumina</b> <b>dust,</b> and caustic mist in contemporary best-practice bauxite mining and alumina refining operations have not been demonstrated {{to be associated with}} clinically significant decre-ments in lung function. Exposures to bauxite dust and <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> at such operations are also not associated with the incidence of cancer. Conclusions: A range of occupational health risks in bauxite mining and alumina refining require the maintenance of effective control measures. B auxite mining and alumina refining are the upstream opera-tions of primary aluminum production. This review article de-scribes the industrial processes of bauxite mining and alumina refin-ing and outlines the physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, and psychosocial health risks. PROCESS DESCRIPTION: BAUXITE MINING Bauxite is the principal ore of alumina (Al 2 O 3), which is used to produce aluminum (Al). It is composed of hydrated aluminum oxides, hydrated aluminosilicates, iron oxides, hydrated iron oxides, titanium oxide, and silica. It contains mixtures of various minerals such as gibbsite, boehmite, hematite, goethite, Al-goethite, anatase, rutile, ilmenite, kaolin, and quartz. Bauxite is a residual rock formed from the weathering of various igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. These parent rocks have been exposed to long periods (millions of years) of weath-ering under tropical, subtropical, or very wet temperate conditions. Ninety percent of the known world bauxite resources are in tropical locations. Other deposits outside these latitudes have been exposed to long periods of intense weathering in their geologic past...|$|E
40|$|Phagocytosis of quartz {{particles}} by rabbit alveolar macrophages and monocytes {{and human}} granulocytes and monocytes {{was accompanied by}} stimulation of substrate free reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium to formazan. This reflects activation of an oxygen dependent bactericidal system of phagocytes and total (exogenic and endogenic) generation of active oxygen species. Low fibrogenic and cytotoxic <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> tended to increase formazan production by comparison with quartz dust. During phagocytosis of quartz dust by alveolar macrophages and monocytes there was no exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide by these cells. By contrast, incubation of human granulocytes with quartz dust caused {{a significant increase in}} exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide. Under such conditions, low fibrogenic <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> had no effect on hydrogen peroxide generation and substantially decreased the level of superoxide radical generation by human granulocytes. During incubation of rabbit granulocytes with quartz dust, an increase in the level of superoxide radical generation was also detected. It is considered that the differences between alveolar macrophages and granulocytes in their response to quartz dust are important from a physiological point of view. Alveolar macrophages are permanently present in pulmonary alveolae in large quantities; therefore their uncontrolled generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide might immediately cause damage to pulmonary parenchyma. At the same time, destruction products from alveolar macrophages that died during phagocytosis of quartz particles contain a factor attracting granulocytes. Presence of a significant number of granulocytes in bronchopulmonary lavage fluid in cases of silicosis indicates development of a pathological process. This agrees well with the data obtained on exogenic generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide by granulocytes, and on stimulation of this process due to phagocytosis of the quartz dust...|$|E

Comparing the theoretical models with the observations on various IR two-color diagrams for a large sample O-rich AGB stars, {{we find that the}} amorphous <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> (about 10 - 40 %) mixed with amorphous silicate can reproduce much more observed points for the O-rich AGB stars with thin dust envelopes.

40|$|Significant {{differences}} in several components of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL fluid) have previously {{been reported in}} aluminium potroom workers compared with controls. The present paper describes the long term effects in rats of one time exposure to potroom aluminium oxide without fluorides (primary alumina (PA)) or with adsorbed fluorides (secondary alumina (SA)) on components of BAL fluid. <b>Alumina</b> <b>dust</b> (40 mg) suspended in saline was instilled intratracheally; controls received saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed one, four, and 12 months after exposure. The number of cells in BAL fluid was increased significantly (p < 0. 05) by SA but not PA. The increase was mainly macrophages, but the concentrations of neutrophils also increased about 10 -fold one and 12 months after exposure. Although albumin and hyaluronan concentrations {{did not differ from}} those of controls, fibronectin concentrations were significantly (p < 0. 001) increased one year after exposure both in PA exposed and SA exposed rats. The results indicate that SA, possibly because of adhered fluorides, induces early changes in alveolar cell populations including persistent neutrophilia. These cellular changes may have a destructive effect. The late pronounced increase of fibronectin in both PA and SA exposed rats indicates a delayed effect of alumina on the extracellular matrix...|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} {{a sample of}} evolved stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) with the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. Comparing samples from the SMC, LMC, and the Galaxy reveals that the dust production rate depends on metallicity for oxygen-rich stars, but carbon stars with similar pulsation properties produce similar quantities of dust, regardless of their initial metallicity. Other properties of the oxygen-rich stars also depend on metallicity. As the metallicity decreases, the fraction of naked (i. e., dust-free) stars increases, and among the naked stars, {{the strength of the}} 8 μm absorption band from SiO decreases. Our sample includes several massive stars in the LMC with long pulsation periods that produce significant amounts of dust, probably because they are young and relatively metal-rich. Little <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> is seen in circumstellar shells in the SMC and LMC, unlike in Galactic samples. Three oxygen-rich sources also show emission from magnesium-rich crystalline silicates. Many also show an emission feature at 14 μm. The one S star in our sample shows a newly detected emission feature centered at 13. 5 μm. At lower metallicity, carbon stars with similar amounts of amorphous carbon in their shells have stronger absorption from molecular acetylene (C 2 H 2) and weaker emission from SiC and MgS dust, as discovered in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a search for}} the A-X infrared bands of AlO with a view to better understand the characteristics of this radical. These bands are infrequently encountered in astronomical sources but surprisingly were very prominent in the spectra of two well-known, nova-like variables (V 838 Mon and V 4332 Sgr) thereby motivating us to explore the physical conditions necessary for their excitation. In this study, we present the detection of A-X bands in the spectra of 13 out of 17 stars, {{selected on the basis of}} their J-K colors as potential candidates for detection of these bands. The majority of the AlO detections are in AGB stars viz. 9 OH/IR stars, 2 Mira variables and 2 bright infrared sources. Our study shows that the A-X bands are fairly prevalent in sources with low temperature and O-rich environments. Interesting variation in strength of the AlO bands in one of the sources (IRAS 18530 + 0817) is reported and the cause for this is examined. Possible applications of the present study are discussed in terms of the role of AlO in <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> formation, the scope for estimating the radioactive $^{ 26 }$Al content in AGB stars from the A-X bands, and providing possible targets for further mm/radio studies of AlO which has recently been discovered at millimeter wavelengths.

40|$|We have {{observed}} {{a sample of}} 35 long-period variables and four Cepheid variables {{in the vicinity of}} 23 Galactic globular clusters using the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The long-period variables in the sample cover a range of metallicities from near solar to about 1 / 40 th solar. The dust mass-loss rate from the stars increases with pulsation period and bolometric luminosity. Higher mass-loss rates are associated with greater contributions from silicate grains. The dust mass-loss rate also depends on metallicity. The dependence is most clear when segregating the sample by dust composition, less clear when segregating by bolometric magnitude, and absent when segregating by period. The spectra are rich in solid-state and molecular features. Emission from <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> is apparent across the range of metallicities. Spectra with a 13 - μ m dust emission feature, as well as an associated feature at 20 μ m, also appear at most metallicities. Molecular features in the spectra include H 2 O bands at 6. 4 – 6. 8 μ m, seen in both emission and absorption, SO 2 absorption at 7. 3 – 7. 5 μ m, and narrow emission bands from CO 2 from 13. 5 to 16. 8 μ m.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) evolution of stars with masses between 1 M_ - 8. 5 M_. We focus on stars with a solar chemical composition, which {{allows us to}} interpret evolved stars in the Galaxy. We present a detailed comparison with models of the same chemistry, calculated with a different evolution code and based on {{a different set of}} physical assumptions. We find that stars of mass > 3. 5 M_ experience hot bottom burning {{at the base of the}} envelope. They have AGB lifetimes shorter than ∼ 3 × 10 ^ 5 yr and eject into their surroundings gas contaminated by proton-capture nucleosynthesis, at an extent sensitive to the treatment of convection. Low mass stars with 1. 5 M_< M < 3 M_ become carbon stars. During the final phases the C/O ratio grows to ∼ 3. We find a remarkable agreement between the two codes for the low-mass models and conclude that predictions for the physical and chemical properties of these stars, and the AGB lifetime, are not that sensitive to the modelling of the AGB phase. The dust produced is also dependent on the mass: low-mass stars produce mainly solid carbon and silicon carbide dust, whereas higher mass stars produce silicates and <b>alumina</b> <b>dust.</b> Possible future observations potentially able to add more robustness to the present results are also discussed.

The {{size and the}} amount of the carbon particles formed follows a positive trend with themass of the star; the carbon grains with the largest size (a_ C∼ 0. 2 μm) are produced by AGB stars with M_ ini = 2. 5 - 3 M_, as these stars are those achieving the largest enrichment of carbon in the surface regions.

40|$|Aims: We {{study the}} {{production}} of dust in Type II-P supernova by coupling the gas-phase chemistry to the dust nucleation and condensation phases. We consider two supernova progenitor masses with homogeneous and clumpy ejecta to assess the chemical type and quantity of dust that forms. Grain size distributions are derived {{as a function of}} post-explosion time. Methods: The chemistry of the gas phase and the simultaneous formation of dust clusters are described by a chemical network. The formation of key species (CO, SiO) and dust clusters of silicates, alumina, silica, metal carbides and sulphides, pure metals, and amorphous carbon is considered. The master equations describing the chemistry of the nucleation phase are coupled to a dust condensation formalism based on Brownian coagulation. Results: Type II-P supernovae produce dust grains of various chemical compositions and size distributions as a function of time. The grain size distributions gain in complexity with time, are slewed towards large grains, and differ from the usual MRN power-law distribution used for interstellar dust. Gas density enhancements in the form of clumps strongly affect the dust chemical composition and the grain size distributions. Silicates and pure metallic grains are highly dependent on clumpiness. Specifically, clumpy ejecta produce grains over 0. 1 micron, and the final dust mass reaches 0. 14 Msun. Conversely, carbon and <b>alumina</b> <b>dust</b> masses are controlled by the mass yields of alumina and carbon in the zones where the dust is produced. Several dust components form in the ejecta and the total dust mass gradually builds up over a time span of 3 to 5 years post-outburst. This gradual growth provides a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the small dust masses formed at early post-explosion times and the high dust masses derived from recent observations of supernova remnants.
