40|$|A {{numerical}} shooting {{method for}} performing linear stability analyses of travelling waves is described {{and applied to}} the problem of freely propagating planar premixed flames. Previous linear stability analyses of premixed flames either employ high <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> asymptotics or have been performed numerically with finite <b>activation</b> <b>temperature,</b> but either for unit Lewis numbers (which ignores thermal-diffusive effects) or in the limit of small heat release (which ignores hydrodynamic effects). In this paper the full reactive Navier-Stokes equations are used with arbitrary values of the parameters (<b>activation</b> <b>temperature,</b> Lewis number, heat of reaction, Prandtl number), for which both thermal-diffusive and hydrodynamic effects on the instability, and their interactions, are taken into account. Comparisons are made with previous asymptotic and numerical results. For Lewis numbers very close to or above unity, for which hydrodynamic effects caused by thermal expansion are the dominant destablizing mechanism, it is shown that slowly varying flame analyses give qualitatively good but quantitatively poor predictions, and also that the stability is insensitive to the <b>activation</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, for Lewis numbers sufficiently below unity for which thermal-diffusive effects play a major role, the stability of the flame becomes very sensitive to the <b>activation</b> <b>temperature.</b> Indeed, unphysically high activation temperatures are required for the high <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> analysis to give quantitatively good predictions at such low Lewis numbers.

30|$|The {{interaction}} of activation {{time and temperature}} at fixed activating agent dose for adsorption capacity has a curvature in response surface plot as shown in Fig.  2 a. The methylene blue adsorption capacity achieves a maximum value of 71.4  mg/g when the activated carbon is prepared either at minimum activation time and maximum <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> or at maximum activation time and minimum <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> conditions. Whereas, at minimum activation time and minimum <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> or maximum activation time and maximum <b>activation</b> <b>temperature,</b> the adsorption capacity was found lower. The activated carbon adsorption capacity against methylene blue achieved maximum value when {{the temperature of the}} activation was the highest (at 850  °C) and the time taken to prepare that activated carbon was only 50  min which was the lowest value of activation time. The other condition for preparing the higher adsorption capacity activated carbon was activation time 120  min and <b>activation</b> <b>temperature</b> 450  °C at a constant H 3 PO 4 concentration (4.25  mol/L). These results can be interpreted as, at a low temperature of activation, the banana trunk biomass needs longer time to generate pores in the activated carbons suitable for the adsorption of methylene blue, and at a higher temperature of activation pores generated in the activated carbons in a shorter time.|$|E

In this study we report immersion-mode INP number concentrations as a function of size at six ground sites in North America and one in Europe. The lowest INP number concentrations were observed at Arctic and alpine locations and the highest at suburban and agricultural locations, consistent with previous studies of INP concentrations in similar environments.

After <b>activation</b> at <b>temperatures</b> ranging from 500 ° to 700 °C, clay waste exhibited high pozzolanic activity. Analysis with instrumental techniques such as X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy showed that higher temperatures favored the formation of calcium aluminate hydrates, hydrotalcite-like compounds, and strätlingite, while at lower temperatures, CSH gels constituted the majority hydrated phase.
