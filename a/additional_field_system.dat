In Part II, a chaotic field is added to the system. The effect of the <b>additional</b> <b>field</b> on the resonance fluorescence spectrum, probe absorption spectrum and the intensity-intensity correlation function is examined analytically and numerically. In Part III, the same calculations are performed when the atom interacts with a coherent field and a classical squeezed fieldAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DXN 042874 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreSIGLEGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We give a {{formulation}} of quantum cosmology with a pressureless dust and arbitrary <b>additional</b> matter <b>fields.</b> The <b>system</b> has the property that its Hamiltonian constraint is linear {{in the dust}} momentum. This feature provides a natural time gauge, leading to a physical hamiltonian {{that is not a}} square root. Quantization leads to Schrödinger equation for which unitary evolution is directly linked to geodesic completeness. Our approach simplifies the analysis of both Wheeler-deWitt and loop quantum cosmology (LQC) models, and significantly broadens the applicability of the latter. This is demonstrated for arbitrary scalar field potential and cosmological constant in LQC. Comment: 8 pages, iopart style + BibTe...|$|R

40|$|We study {{squeezing}} {{properties of}} the fluorescence radiation emitted by a driven Λ-type atom in which the metastable lower energy levels are coupled by an <b>additional</b> <b>field.</b> We find that the relative phase of the applied fields can significantly modify the squeezing characteristics of radiation. It is shown that the <b>additional</b> <b>field</b> connecting the lower levels in the system can induce spectral squeezing in a parameter regime for which the squeezing is absent without the <b>additional</b> <b>field.</b> Moreover, the squeezing can be shifted from inner- to outer-sidebands of the spectrum by simply changing the relative phase. A dressed-state description is presented to explain these numerical results. The phase control of squeezing in the total variance of quadrature components is also examined. We show that the squeezing in total variance attains its maximal value when the system reduces to an effective two-level system. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
