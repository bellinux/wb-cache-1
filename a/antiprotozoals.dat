40|$|The discovery, {{development}} and optimal utilization of pharmaceuticals can be greatly enhanced by {{knowledge of their}} modes of action. However, many drugs currently on the market act by unknown mechanisms. Untargeted metabolomics offers the potential to discover modes of action for drugs that perturb cellular metabolism. Development of high resolution LC-MS methods and improved data analysis software now allows rapid detection of drug-induced changes to cellular metabolism in an untargeted manner. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of untargeted metabolomics to provide unbiased target discovery for antimicrobial drugs, in particular for antiprotozoal agents. Furthermore, the utilization of targeted metabolomics techniques has enabled validation of existing hypotheses regarding antiprotozoal drug mechanisms. Metabolomics approaches are likely to assist with optimization of new drug candidates by identification of drug targets, and by allowing detailed characterization of modes of action and resistance of existing and novel antiprotozoal drugs.

The selectivity of the extracts was also evaluated by testing on a mammalian cell line (L 6 cells). Ethyl acetate extracts were more active than hydroalcoholic ones. Activity against T. cruzi and L. donovani was non-existent to average, but almost half the extracts showed good activity against P. falciparum.

Given {{the high cost of}} drug discovery and development, the high failure rates and the long duration to develop novel treatments, drug repurposing circumvents these obstacles by finding new uses for compounds other than those they were initially intended to treat. In the present review, we summarize in vivo and clinical trial findings testing clinical candidates and marketed drugs against schistosomes, food-borne trematodes, soil-transmitted helminths, Strongyloides stercoralis, the major human filariases lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, taeniasis, neurocysticercosis and echinococcosis. While expanding the applications of broad-spectrum or veterinary anthelmintics continues to fuel alternative treatment options, antimalarials, antibiotics, <b>antiprotozoals</b> and anticancer agents appear to be producing fruitful results as well. The trematodes and nematodes continue to be most investigated, while cestodal drug discovery will need to be accelerated. The most clinically advanced drug candidates include the artemisinins and mefloquine against schistosomiasis, tribendimidine against liver flukes, oxantel pamoate against trichuriasis, and doxycycline against filariasis. Preclinical studies indicate a handful of promising future candidates, and are beginning to elucidate the broad-spectrum activity of some currently used anthelmintics.

40|$|Ligand binding to {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR) is discussed. This is an {{extremely}} important enzyme, {{as it is the}} target of several drugs (inhibitors) which are used clinically as antibacterials, <b>antiprotozoals</b> and in cancer chemotherapy. DHFR catalyzes the NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) dependent reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate, which is used in several pathways of purine and pyrimidine iosynthesis, including that of thymidylate. Since DNA synthesis is dependent on a continuing supply of thymidylate, a blockade of DHFR resulting in a depletion of thymidylate can lead to the cessation of growth of a rapidly proliferating cell line. DHFR exhibits a significant species to species variability in its sensitivity to various inhibitors. For example, trimethoprim, an inhibitor of DHFR, binds to bacterial DHFR's 5 orders of magnitude greater than to vertebrate DHFR's. The structural mechanics, dynamics and energetics of a family of dihydrofolate reductases are studied to rationalize the basis for the inhibitor of these enyzmes and to understand the molecular basis of the difference in the binding constants between the species. This involves investigating the conformational changes induced in the protein on binding the ligand, the internal strain imposed by the enzyme on the ligand, the restriction of fluctuations in atom positions due to binding and the consequent change in entropy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{drug use}} in pregnancy, and compare drug use of pregnant women with non-pregnant women with respect to possible teratogenicity. Study design: A cross-sectional study based on pharmacy records from 1997 to 2001 was performed. Pregnant women and matched non-pregnant women (same physician and age) were identified. Prescriptions were set against the Australian risk classification. Results: Thirty-five percent of all prescriptions for non-pregnant women were safe in pregnancy (Australian classification A), in 14 % the risk was unknown (B 1, B 2), 49 % were potentially harmful drugs (B 3, C, D, X), and in 3 % no classification was available. For pregnant women these figures were 86, 3, 10 and 2 %, respectively. In non-pregnant women the highest percentages of prescriptions for unsafe drugs were for psycholeptics (99 % not classified as safe), psychoanaleptics (100 %), anti-inflammatory/antirheumetic products (100 %), antihistamines (94 %), antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (81 %), antiepileptics (100 %), beta-blockers (100 %), systemic antimycotics (100 %), <b>antiprotozoals</b> (97 %), diuretics (100 %) and immunosuppressives (100 %). In pregnant women this pattern was comparable, except for antihistamines (22 %) and antacids/anti-ulcer drugs (3 %). Conclusion: We conclude that many drugs used by non-pregnant women should be avoided in pregnancy, and that pregnant women indeed do so. However, for some drug groups the available safe alternatives are limited. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
