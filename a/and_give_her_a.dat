5|$|In an {{interview}} with Misako Aoki in 2015, Kurosaki discussed the influence of lolita fashion on her work. Her life changed when she encountered lolita fashion, and modeling in the style would broaden her world <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> sense of comfort. Kurosaki {{was inspired by the}} film Legally Blonde because of the film's main character always wearing what she wants to wear, and how the main character's bedroom is colored pastel pink, a color scheme that Kurosaki liked.|$|E
5|$|Dan and Gretta {{meet with}} Saul, Dan's {{business}} partner {{and co-founder of}} their record label, {{but he does not}} see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Gretta's best friend Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album. When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{conditions}} were deteriorating on Königsberg. There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although {{safe from the}} British, the crew was ravaged by malaria and other tropical ailments. Generally {{cut off from the}} outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, Rubens, was renamed Kronborg. It was given a Danish flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak Danish. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, Königsberg prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, Königsberg was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. Hyacinth intercepted Kronborg as she approached, and chased her to Manza Bay. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.|$|E

5|$|Ripley 8 (Sigourney Weaver), {{also known}} as Number 8, is a human-Alien hybrid cloned from the DNA of Ellen Ripley and the {{embryonic}} Alien Queen recovered from Ripley's blood samples taken from Fury 161. The DNA's integrity has been compromised {{by the process of}} infestation and the human and Alien DNA in Number 8 is mixed, creating a humanoid organism with Alien traits such as an empathic link {{with the rest of the}} hive, acidic blood, enhanced strength and reflexes and genetic memories. After United Systems Military researchers extract the Alien Queen from Number 8 on the ship USM Auriga in the year 2381, they keep her alive and confined <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> rudimentary education. When the Aliens breach their containment, Number 8 joins the crew of the mercenary vessel Betty to attempt an escape; she is captured by the Aliens, who bring her to their nest. Number 8's Alien Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a hybrid which identifies Number 8 as its mother after it kills the Alien Queen. Number 8 escapes from the Auriga on the Betty and again encounters the Newborn, which she jettisons into space. After the Betty lands on Earth, Number 8 looks around with the other survivors and wonders about their uncertain future.|$|E

So Rahab asked the spies to swear by God, since she had dealt kindly with them, that they would also deal kindly with her father's house <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> token to save her family from the coming invasion. The spies told her that if she would not tell of their doings, then when God gave the Israelites the land, they would deal kindly with her. She let them down by a cord through her window, as her house was on the city wall. She told them to hide in the mountain for three days. They told her that when the Israelites came to the land, she was to bind in her window the scarlet rope by which she let the spies down and gather her family into her house for safety, as all who ventured out of the doors of her house would die. She agreed, sent them on their way, and bound the scarlet line in her window.|$|E
25|$|The group {{formally}} meets Diana {{who they}} learn has a frail body and has lost her will to live. Diana {{has the power}} to glimpse into the future and see people's fates but Shinjiro eventually convinces her that even if the circumstances look dire, she can fight her destiny <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> new path to follow. Diana joins the Star Division and helps them repel an attack by Yumedono, a vain woman who wants to engulf New York in insects. After losing a duel with Subaru, Shinjiro is forced to perform on stage as a new star called Peppermint. Subaru questions why Shinjiro is able to succeed even though he is flawed. Subaru opens herself up to the group eventually recognizing everyone's importance in her life, including Shinjiro's. The Star Division repels an attack led by Tsugarubi, who resents women and steals their life essence turning them into stone. Soon, after learning about the Five Star Warriors, Shinjiro recruits Gemini to the Star Division due to her ties to the Five Star Warriors. But in discovering that Ranmaru is one of their enemies, Gemini's sister Geminine—who resides in her body as an alter-ego—plots to exact revenge for her master's death. Shinjiro persuades Geminine not to go through with it. Afterwards, subduing an attack led by Ranmaru, Geminine decides to rest inside Gemini for a while after using too much of her influence to dominate Gemini's body.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{appraisal}} of Pacer has been mixed. Allmusics Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes the album as [...] "exciting, gut-level rock & roll". The Rough Guide to Rock calls Pacer [...] "satisfyingly lo-fi". In Spin magazine, reviewer Joy Press {{writes that the}} album includes [...] "a half-dozen gems" [...] but that its overall [...] "foggy sound" [...] and [...] "indecipherable lyrics" [...] prevent the listener from fully embracing the work. Robert Christgau considers the album's songs to be [...] "definitely slight" [...] and [...] "uneven" [...] but praises the vocals, stating that [...] "speedy or dreamy, Kim Deal sounds so sane, so unpretentious, so goddamn nice {{that you want to}} take her home <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> shampoo". In The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, critic Ira Robbins writes that [...] "Other than the fine title track and a few others, the performances are forced and lackluster; the production varies between flat and colorless." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide similarly praises the title song while dismissing the rest of the album as [...] "forgettable".|$|E

On returning to the café, the trio finds the Doctor near death; he asks River to find [...] "River Song" [...] <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> message, then whispers something in her ear before he passes away. River, who at this point still only knows herself as Melody Pond, asks Amy who River Song is; Amy uses the Teselecta to show River her form stored in the robot's database of who she is to become. With this, River sacrifices her remaining regenerations to bring the Doctor back to life, and passes out. The Doctor, Amy, and Rory take her {{to a hospital in}} the far future, leaving the TARDIS-shaped diary as a gift by her bedside, and depart. Later, River is shown becoming an archaeologist so she can find the Doctor herself. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor has discovered the date of his death from the records aboard the Teselecta, but does not reveal this knowledge to Amy or Rory.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19, 1910. It states: [...] "Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from babyhood. Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages, on {{an island in the}} Indies, on which there are few inhabitants. Here the children are reared, knowing no play fellows but each other. When Virginia is 16 years of age, her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris, who offers to make Virginia her heir <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> good education, providing Virginia will, in the future, make her aunt's home her own. Virginia's mother, having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family, feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure. She accordingly insists upon Virginia's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer. Virginia thereupon sets sail for France, leaving Paul broken-hearted at her departure. Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt, who is very old and sickly, although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul, whom she dearly loves. When, however, the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman, Virginia refuses; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home. Virginia's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane, and although a cable's length from shore, it sinks before help can reach it, and Virginia is drowned. Paul witnesses her death from the shore, and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nilsson {{followed}} {{quickly with}} Son of Schmilsson (1972), released while its predecessor {{was still in}} the charts. Besides the problem of competing with himself, Nilsson was by then ignoring most of Perry's production advice and his decision to give free rein to his bawdiness and bluntness on this release alienated some of his earlier, more conservative fan base. With lyrics like [...] "I sang my balls off for you, baby", [...] "Roll the world over / <b>And</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> kiss and a feel", and the notorious [...] "You're breakin' my heart / You're tearin' it apart / So fuck you" [...] (a reference to his ongoing divorce), Nilsson had traveled far afield from his earlier work. The album nevertheless reached #12 on the Billboard 200, and the single [...] "Spaceman" [...] was a Top 40 hit in October 1972. The follow-up single [...] "Remember (Christmas)", however, stalled at #53. A third single, the tongue-in-cheek C send up [...] "Joy", was issued on RCA's country imprint Green and credited to Buck Earle, but it failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|Mari Shimazaki {{designed}} the game's characters to be [...] "fashionable", with [...] "subdued" [...] features. She {{designed the}} titular character to fulfill Kamiya's {{request for a}} modern, female witch that wears glasses and wields four guns, and the two settled on her original concept for the character despite her work [...] "over a year" [...] on other concepts. Bayonetta emerged as a long-haired, black-clothed witch with a beehive hairdo (in place of the traditional pointy hat) and glasses (which Kamiya [...] "really pushed for... to differentiate Bayonetta from other female characters <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> sense of mystery and intelligence"). Conversely, Shimazaki [...] "didn't require {{a huge amount of}} effort" [...] to design Bayonetta's short-haired, red-clothed rival Jeanne, who merely wears her glasses on her head above her eyes. She added plumes to Jeanne's handguns to add movement to the design, and thick makeup to Jeanne's face to [...] "make [...] feel like something out of the 1960s". Though Shimazaki preferred Bayonetta, Jeanne {{turned out to be the}} more popular of the two witches among Kamiya and the development team. [...] Still, in an April 2009 interview, Kamiya called the former [...] "in many ways... my ideal woman".|$|E
