50|$|Diesel {{engines in}} service today raise the fuel to extreme {{pressures}} by mechanical pumps and deliver {{it to the}} combustion chamber by pressure-activated injectors without compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle. The early <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> diesels always had a superior combustion without the sharp increase in pressure during combustion. Research is now being performed and patents are being taken out to again use some form of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> to reduce the nitrogen oxides and pollution, reverting to Diesel's original implementation with its superior combustion and possibly quieter operation. In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder. With much higher pressures and high technology injectors, present-day diesel engines use the so-called solid injection system applied by Herbert Akroyd Stuart for his hot bulb <b>engine.</b> The indirect <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> {{could be considered the}} latest development of these low speed hot bulb ignition engines.|$|R

The increase in internal bond strength was {{much larger than the}} drop in modulus of rupture, showing the effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>injection.</b> The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also reduced the necessary pressing time. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was shown to be effective because the advantages outweighed the disadvantage.|$|R
30|$|Particleboards with {{thickness}} of 10  mm and densities of 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8  g/cm 3 were manufactured from high-moisture particles using urea–formaldehyde resin {{and the effectiveness}} of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was examined. The temperature in the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without during the initial to middle stages of pressing, while the temperature in the 0.8  g/cm 3 board remained lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without throughout the entire pressing process. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the pressing time required to manufacture the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards and also increased the internal bond strength of boards of all densities. In the 0.6 and 0.7  g/cm 3 boards, <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture (MOR), while in the 0.8  g/cm 3 boards, the MOR was similar between those manufactured by injecting and not injecting <b>air.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also found to be effective for boards of high densities. The effectiveness of the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on thick boards was investigated by manufacturing 20 -mm-thick boards of 0.7  g/cm 3. Without <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> {{it was not possible to}} manufacture the 20 -mm-thick boards, even by extended hot pressing, but <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> allowed the boards to be manufactured by pressing for 16  min. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also shown to be effective for manufacturing thick boards.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} experiments {{investigating the}} effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on the cloud cavitation of an oscillating hydrofoil. The effects of continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> were investigated using two different hydrofoils. Measurements of the acoustic pressure were made on the downstream test section floor and {{on the surface of}} one of hydrofoils, and the extent of noise reduction provided by <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> at various volume flow rates was determined. The acoustic surface pressure measurements were also correlated with visual observations made using high speed motion pictures of the cloud cavitation. Thus {{the effects of}} continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on specific cavitation structures could be identified. In addition, the effectiveness of pulsed <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> in achieving greater reductions in cavitation noise at volume flow rates equal to those used in continuous <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> experiments was investigated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> {{in light}} oil {{reservoirs}} has received considerable attention as an effective, {{improved oil recovery}} process, based primarily {{on the success of}} several projects within the Williston Basin in the United States. The main mechanism of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> is the oxidation behavior between oxygen and crude oil in the reservoir. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> is a good option because of its wide availability and low cost. Whether <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> can be applied to shale is an interesting topic from both economic and technical perspectives. This paper initiates a comprehensive discussion on the feasibility and potential of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> in shale oil reservoirs based on state-of-the-art literature review. Favorable and unfavorable effects of using <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> are discussed in an analogy analysis on geology, reservoir features, temperature, pressure, and petrophysical, mineral and crude oil properties of shale oil reservoirs. The available data comparison of the historically successful <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> projects with typical shale oil reservoirs in the U. S. is summarized in this paper. Some operation methods to improve <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> performance are recommended. This paper provides an avenue for us to make use of many of the favorable conditions of shale oil reservoirs for implementing <b>air</b> <b>injection,</b> or <b>air</b> huff ‘n’ puff injection, and the low cost of air has the potential to improve oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the aspects of mixture {{preparation}} in petrol engines which are {{of interest to the}} mechanical engineers and researchers. The work reviewed the characteristics and behaviour of fuel and air flow in the intake manifolds of petrol engines and emphasised on investigation of fuel distribution between cylinders in a carburation engine and a multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine.</b> Characteristics of the flows of liquid fuel film, fuel droplets, fuel evaporation and process of mixing of fuel and air were analysed. The presence and behaviour of a large amount of liquid fuel film and fuel droplets in the intake manifolds was confirmed to be a main cause of inhomogeneity of mixture supplied to the cylinders. Atomising fuel spray and heating inlet manifolds are good methods for improving fuel evaporation and mixing of fuel and air in the intake manifolds to achieve homogeneous mixture for good operations of the engines. Fuel distribution between cylinders of a carburation engine and a multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> was investigated, using the method of exhaust gas analysis. The results showed that in the multi-point <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> fuel distribution between the cylinders is much better than in the carburation <b>engine</b> although the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> is equipped with a pneumatically controlled fuel injection pump (delta A/F ratio of 0. 35 to 0. 93 in the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> in contrast of delta A/F ratio of 0. 76 to 1. 7 in the carburation engine at normal running conditions). <b>Injection</b> <b>engines</b> equipped with an electronically controlled fuel injection system would have much better improvement in fuel distribution than the <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> used for the present study. Heating the intake manifold in the carburation engine (by increasing coolant temperature) indicated a good improvement in fuel distribution between the cylinders while heating inlet air was not an effective way. In the <b>injection</b> <b>engine,</b> fuel distribution between the cylinders was seen to be not significantly affected by heating...|$|R

30|$|The {{temperature}} of the 0.6 -g/cm 3 boards was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without until 3  min. In the 0.7 -g/cm 3 boards, the temperature was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without until 6  min. In the 0.8 -g/cm 3 boards, the temperature was always lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without. Although the temperature was lower with <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> than without, IB was higher in the boards manufactured by injecting air than by not injecting air (Fig.  2). The urea–formaldehyde resin did not act sufficiently as a binder under high moisture conditions, even at high temperatures, possibly because high moisture inhibits curing, and causes excessive penetration of resin into the wood particles [15]. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> {{was found to be}} effective for accelerating the curing of urea–formaldehyde resin by discharging vapor.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> {{have not been}} fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of dilution tunnel used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new dilution tunnel was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines.</b> A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a dilution tunnel. The performance of the dilution tunnel demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|R

30|$|Previous paper {{reported}} {{the effects of}} <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> {{on the performance of}} boards manufactured from high-moisture (25  %) particles (high-moisture board), which were used to skip the drying process and reduce energy consumption [1 – 3]. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was successfully used to manufacture high-moisture boards without blowout. On the other hand, it was shown that the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also caused the discharge of binder from the boards [2].|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} of the board manufactured from low-moisture particles was superior to that of high-moisture particles [1, 5]. Conditions for blowout of the boards {{as well as the}} {{performance of}} the boards manufactured varied according to whether high- or low-moisture particles were used. Another of our previous paper investigated the effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on boards manufactured from low-moisture (15  %) particles (low-moisture board) [6]. It was necessary to confirm the effects of <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> on preventing blowout of the low-moisture boards since blowout still occurs in factory production as described above. <b>Air</b> <b>injection</b> was also shown to be effective in preventing blowout of low-moisture boards. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> inevitably discharges binder from low-moisture boards as well as for high-moisture boards [6]. Although the <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> was expected to impair the board performance due to discharge of the binder, the board performance was unimpaired [6], suggesting that <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> can also prevent accidental blowout in factory production without impairing the {{performance of the}} boards and thus improve productivity.|$|R

30|$|The {{modulus of rupture}} was 18.4  MPa in {{the board}} {{manufactured}} by not injecting air and was 15.0  MPa in the board manufactured by injecting air (Fig.  4, pressing time 8  min, pressing at 210 °C). The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture by 21 %. On the other hand, the internal bond strengths of the boards were 0.27 and 0.60  MPa, respectively. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> increased the internal bond strengths by 2.2 times. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> reduced the modulus of rupture and increased the internal bond strength. The effect of increasing the internal bond strength was larger than the reduction of modulus of rupture. The <b>air</b> <b>injection</b> also reduced the pressing time.
