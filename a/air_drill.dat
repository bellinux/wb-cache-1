30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} the existence of the critical condition of borehole stability during <b>air</b> <b>drilling.</b> Rock Failure Process Analysis Code 2 D was used to set up a damage model of the borehole excavated in strain-softening rock. Damage evolution around the borehole was studied by tracking acoustic emission. The study indicates that excavation damaged zone (EDZ) is formed around borehole because of stress concentration after the borehole is excavated. There is a critical condition for borehole stability; the borehole will collapse when the critical damage condition is reached. The critical condition of underground excavation exists not only in elastic and ideal plastic material but in strain-softening material as well. The research is helpful to developing an evaluation method of borehole stability during <b>air</b> <b>drilling.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{ensure the}} normal {{drilling}} and well site safety, a monitoring system {{is necessary in}} <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> to monitor the real-time information in total drilling. By using the LMS algorithm and adaptive delayed transversal filter, a mathematical model of underground blasting monitoring is established, and an information monitoring system is also developed based on wireless communication and field bus technologies. The system is characterized by miniaturization, lower cost, convenient operation and transportation, powerful function. The experiment results show that this system can not only provide accurate <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters and stratum information, but also can monitor the real-time contents of flammable, explosive and toxic gas, which provides a guide for the identify of water-oil-gas layer, supervising drilling and preventing the occurrence of safety accidents in well site...|$|R

40|$|The {{inherent}} {{variability of}} seed and fertilizer application from volumetric metering devices is not readily recognized. The Canadian Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (P AMI) suggests a maximum {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of 15 % among outlets for seeding grain or applying fertilizer. P AMI does not report down-the-row variability of individual outlets. Parameters that influence variability of volumetric measuring external fluted wheels such as rotational speed of the metering wheel, product delivery rate, seed size, and cell collection lengths were examined. In the first study, external fluted wheel meters on four grain drills were tested for seed delivery variability for wheat and soybeans, both among the metering outlets and down-the-row for individual meters. Tests on two additional drills, one an <b>air</b> <b>drill</b> {{and the other with}} external fluted metering, used two sizes of soybean seeds and two travel speeds. For wheat, down-the-row CV ranged from 12. 5 to 22. 5 % and the CV among metering units ranged from 12. 5 to 21 %. For soybeans, the CV ranged from 15. 5 to 41. 5 % with the <b>air</b> <b>drill</b> having the lower CV. A faster travel speed gave a lower CV for both drills metering soybeans. In a second study, when metering wheat, the seeding rate variability due to cell size and seeding rate were evaluated. Each meter was evaluated with cells 0. 48 or 0. 96 m in length and seeding rates of 60, 80, 90, and 100 kg/ha. The down-the-row CV ranged from 10 to 28 % with 0. 48 m length cells, and from 4 to 22 % with 0. 96 m length cells. Some of these CVs may be too high for a metering mechanism such as the fluted wheel to be used in SSCM...|$|E

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small <b>air</b> <b>drill</b> for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|E

40|$|The Ekoodlaren (Eco cropper) {{is a new}} {{implement}} {{constructed to}} prepare the seedbed, to seed, to fertilize and to row weed in single or combined operations. The main purposes for the construction is to save time and money, and to reduce excessive packing of the soil. Its drilling and row hoeing qualities were examined at the Department of Soil Sciences in three series of field trials during 1991. Two of the series, 'Seed coulters: Different tillage methods' (Rl- 5015) and 'Seed coulters: Minimized tillage' (R 2 - 5016), were carried out on the Ultuna property. The third (R 2 -S 017), concerning row hoeing in small grains, {{was carried out in}} the county of Östergötland. In R 2 - 5015, the use of Ekoodlaren and three other drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations. The seedbed treatments were seeding after mouldboard plowing and harrowing, stubble cultivation and harrowing and direct drilling. In R 2 -S 016, three different drills were compared after three different seedbed preparations (zero, one and three harrowings) in both autumn ploughed and shallow cultivated plots. In R 2 - 5017, the work of Ekoodlaren was compared with a drill equipped with hoe coulters in one treatment. The other treatments concerned row hoeing and fertilizing with Ekoodlaren. The shape of the frame of the Ekoodlaren is a T. The seed box emanates from a Tive <b>air</b> <b>drill.</b> The load carrying wheels are mounted on bogies, where the working depth regulation mechanism and the coulters (duckfoot shovels) are also mounted. The placement of the seeds was carried out nearly as well by the Ekoodlaren as by the reference machines equipped with hoe coulters. Then number of emerged plants was slightly higher than for the reference drill in the row weeding trials. The stands of wintering weeds and volunteer plants were strongly decreased by the drill operation of the Ekoodlaren. The effect on annual weeds depended upon the conditions during the seeding operation. Rainy weather delayed the row weeding to a time when the crop was too developed for normal weeding operations in practical farming. Row weeding small grains did decrease the weed stand. The shovels did not remove any grain plants, but weeding did decrease the yield compared to the unworked Ekoodlaren treatment. The abnormal weather conditions (unusually wet) prevented any attempts to interpret the results for a more normal year. No notable yield differences occurred in the Ultuna trials, while in the row weeding trials, seeding with Ekoodlaren gave a higher yield in all treatments. In the Ultuna trials, the overall variances were small. This was not the case in the Östergötland trials due to a considerable weed stand (developed during previous cropping seasons) and unusually wet weather conditions. Results of other research, partly with the Ekoodlaren, concerning fuel consumption and required time for field work have shown slightly lower costs compared to conventional tillage methods and clear possibilities of saving time and fuel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Air {{injection}} rate {{as the key}} parameter of <b>drilling</b> <b>air</b> {{is directly related to}} the success of drilling procedure. In the previous studies, most of air {{injection rate}} models were built based on the vertical wells, which are not appropriate for horizontal and highly-deviated well and limit the wide application of <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> to some extent. Based on the movement analysis of cuttings, this paper assumed that after the cuttings deposit to the low side of borehole, Air is injected to carry the cuttings out of the wellbore. Then, the starting velocity model in different hole angles is established through the stress analysis of cuttings motion, which can be used to calculate the minimum air injection rate. The numerical simulation results show that starting velocity of cuttings reaches the maximum in the hole angle 60 - 70 degrees. The larger diameter cuttings require a high starting velocity, which is difficulty to be transported. This means some appropriate methods should be applied for <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> procedure, like using secondary crush tools. The subsidence degree is one important factor to the calculation model, and it is necessary to study cutting subsidence degree in next step...|$|R

The ease of machinability of this material makes it a more desirable operand in manufacturing usage. Hence, in this research, a study was undertaken to perform a comparative analysis of dry and cold <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> on 6061 aluminium alloy. The drill tool used in the drilling process was HSS Cobalt coated tool which has not featured in many research papers. Subsequently, the quality of each hole was identified based on the diameter accuracy of the hole and the surface roughness of the hole. A variation in the parameters was employed to identify the best feed rate and spindle speed that can accommodate a quality hole. In addition, during the drilling operations, force was measured to analyse the ensemble of parameters that present the highest and lowest force. Based on the data collected, an analysis was performed to identify the best quality hole. The force measured for cold <b>air</b> <b>drilling</b> was relatively lower than those measured in dry drilling primarily when high feed rate of 80 mm/min and high speed of 6000 rpm is used.
