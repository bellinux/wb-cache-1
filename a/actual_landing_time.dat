40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{aircraft}} landing problem that is to assign landing times to aircraft approaching the airport under consideration. Each aircraft’s landing time must be in a time interval encompassing a target landing time. If the <b>actual</b> <b>landing</b> <b>time</b> deviates from the target landing time additional costs occur which depend {{on the amount of}} earliness and lateness, respectively. The objective is to minimize overall cost. We consider the set of aircraft being partitioned into aircraft classes such that two aircraft of the same class are equal with respect to wake turbulence. We develop algorithms to solve the corresponding problem. Analyzing the worst case run time behavior, we show that our algorithms run in polynomial time for fairly general cases of the problem. Moreover, we present integer programming models. We show by means of a computational study how optimality properties can be used to increase efficiency of standard solvers...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a unified algorithm for arrival aircraft target tracking and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prediction is approached from a hybrid linear systems approach. Discrete-time hybrid state models are derived and two state estimation algorithms, the Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) and particle filtering with resampling, are implemented for target tracking. Along with the standard Markov chain model for discrete mode changes, the idea of autonomous transitions, or mode changes which depend on the continuous state, are utilized in filtering. The IMM algorithm with autonomous transitions incorporated in discrete mode estimation is developed as an effective ETA predictor. The IMM algorithm is also {{found to be more}} efficient than particle filters in terms of run-time and target tracking accuracy. Tracking is performed on observed and simulated data to have RMS errors of less than 50 ft in position and less than 10 ft/s in velocity. ETA predictions are made within 30 seconds of <b>actual</b> <b>landing</b> <b>time</b> for time horizons of nearly 20 minutes. I...|$|E

Storms were observed and nowcast by the nowcast system SWIRLS from the Hong Kong Observatory. Storms were considered as no-go zones for aircraft and deviation routes were determined with the DIVSIM software package. Two days (21  and 22  May 2011) with 22  actual flown routes were investigated. Flights were simulated with a nowcast issued at the time an aircraft entered the TMA or departed from the airport. These flights were compared with a posteriori simulations, in which all storm fields were known and circumnavigated. Both types of simulated routes were then compared with the actual flown routes. The qualitative comparison of the various routes revealed generally good agreement. Larger {{differences were found in}} more complex situations with many active storms in the TMA. Route differences resulted primarily from air traffic control measures imposed such as holdings, slow-downs and shortcuts, causing the largest differences between the estimated and <b>actual</b> <b>landing</b> <b>time.</b> Route differences could be enhanced as aircraft might be forced to circumnavigate a storm ahead in a different sense.

40|$|The DLR Institute of Flight Guidance {{is one of}} {{the leading}} establishments in the field of air traffic {{management}} (ATM) research worldwide. The institute's research activities include validation and verification of new systems and procedures, such as airport infrastructure, routes, or assistance systems for air traffic controllers and pilots. Research is supported by a number of different simulation environments. Real-time simulators like the Apron and Tower Simulator or the Air Traffic Management and Operations Simulator, as well as several fast-time simulation tools focus on different parts of air traffic and help to examine various aspects of the air traffic environment (e. g. controller view, pilot view, general traffic situation, etc.). The utilisation of all simulation systems in the Institute of Flight Guidance is focused on scientific research, and thus significant effort is placed in the analysis of simulation results. To support this task the Institute of Flight Guidance has implemented the software system “Extensible Workflow Management for Simulations” (EWMS) for simulation process and data management. EWMS supports most of the simulation envi¬ron¬ments used within the institute, and provides generic reporting algorithms independent of the simulation system used. As the different simulation environments use a wide range of output data types and formats, the simulated flight trajectories have to be converted into one common format for subsequent analysis using the generic algorithms built into EWMS. Therefore, a unified description of flight phases and flight events was developed based on the CAST/ICAO Common Taxonomy Team (CICTT) Phase of Flight Definitions [1] as well as flight event definitions from the EUROCONTROL CDM Implementation Manual [2]. A survey of the simulation environments used in the institute resulted in an initial set of flight phases that could be generated by the different simulators. These flight phases were mapped onto the CAST/ICAO definitions, and extensions were made where the CAST/ICAO model offered no corresponding flight phase. Entrance and exit conditions for each phase of flight (e. g., departure boarding, taxi to runway, initial climb, etc.) were documented. Similarly, conditions for the different flight events (e. g., estimated and <b>actual</b> <b>landing</b> <b>time,</b> estimated and actual in-block-time, etc.) and their relation to flight phase boundaries were defined and documented. The resulting unified flight phase and event model was validated through interviews with ATM and simulation experts, air traffic controllers and pilots. Finally, the model was implemented within the EWMS parsers for the simulation-specific data files. To account for the different capabilities of different simulation environments, the model offers various levels of detail for the individual flight phases. E. g., where one environment may simply show an aircraft that has just taken off as “in flight”, another environment can provide more detailed information about initial climb, climb to cruise and en-route flight. The EWMS accounts for the different levels of detail to enable meaningful comparisons between the different simulations. The generic flight phase and event model enables the implementation of simulation-independent algorithms for the institute’s heterogeneous ATM simulation environments, allowing comparative analyses for simulations from different environments (e. g., fast time and real time simulations). In turn, using the same well-validated algorithms for several environments significantly reduces the effort required for the analysis of individual simulation campaigns. ...|$|E
40|$|Major {{airports}} in Europe experience {{a number of}} arrivals close to the maximum of their capacity throughout the day. Multiple aircraft arrive {{at the airport in}} a short time window and often have to be delayed in the airspace surrounding the airport before they are cleared to land. A higher fuel burn and costs for the airlines is the result, but it also has a negative effect on the environment in terms of additional pollution and noise. The Cross-border Arrival Management (XMAN) project, {{which is part of the}} Single European Sky program, tries to reduce the negative effects of delay in the proximity of airports. The main idea is to shift the necessary delay in the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) or holding towards the cruise flight phase by reducing the speed of aircraft. If an aircraft is inbound for an airport and the expected arrival time is too close to the arrival time of a leading aircraft, the trailing aircraft can be asked to slow down such that it arrives at the airport when the runway is available. The speed reduction or gaining additional flight time is referred to as ‘delay absorption’. Although the shift of delay absorption from the TMA to the en-route phase shows promising results for fuel consumption and reduced emissions, the question rises whether this En-Route Delay Absorption (ERDA) can also have a negative impact on the runway efficiency. If aircraft are delayed too much in an earlier flight phase due to e. g. inaccuracy of the expected arrival times, so called gaps appear in the landing sequence. As a result, the total number of aircraft that actually landed per time period decreases. The idea is that in order to maintain an optimal runway throughput, some expected delay should be left in the TMA for the approach controller to absorb. In that case, the approach controller can fine-tune a tight landing sequence without any gaps that would result in an underused runway when the demand for landings is high. This phenomenon is defined as Runway Pressure. The main goal of this research project is to investigate the effect on the runway throughput when the expected delay is absorbed in the en-route phase. To achieve this goal, different fast time simulations are performed with a model of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The amount of expected delay that needs to be absorbed in an earlier flight phase is calculated in analogy with the working principles of the inbound planning system of both Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle airport. The expected arrival time at the runway is given for an aircraft and compared with the expected arrival time and minimum required separation time of the previous aircraft in the inbound planning. If the trailing aircraft is expected to arrive too soon at the runway, it has to be delayed prior to passing the Initial Approach Fix (IAF). How the aircraft is delayed, is not researched in this project. However, a maximum of five minutes delay absorption in an earlier flight phase is set, based on previous research on this topic. One simulation scenario consists of a period of two hours where the amount of demand for arrivals changes throughout the inbound peak. The demand exceeds the maximum runway capacity for a certain period of time in each arrival peak. The landing sequence order does not change. A comparison is made between scenarios with the same amount of demand throughout the inbound peak, but with all aircraft either experience En-Route Delay Absorption or not. The outcome of the simulations is the average amount of delay in the ? per 20 minutes and the amount of landings per rolling hour. A rolling hour consists of three consecutive time periods of 20 minutes. Based on the simulation outcomes, it can be concluded that ERDA can result in a small decrease of runway throughput, with a maximum of one aircraft per rolling hour. However, a decrease does not always occur. By the end of the inbound peak, the <b>actual</b> <b>landing</b> <b>time</b> of an aircraft with ERDA is between 30 and 90 seconds later than the same aircraft with no ERDA. So the inbound peak is extended in time and shifted backwards with approximately one extra landing when ERDA is applied. The benefit is that aircraft have to spend up to four minutes less in the TMA. An important parameter that determines the runway throughput, is the inter-arrival separation. This separation between different aircraft wake vortex categories is translated from distance to a time based separation. The same time interval at the threshold is used for the interval times between aircraft passing the IAF. The required passing time at the IAF can be calculated by one average flight time for each aircraft category, where a distinction has to be made between the flight time of jet and turboprop engine aircraft. If the total flight time in the TMA between aircraft categories deviates more than one minute, it can be necessary to use different approach paths to the final approach fix for each aircraft category, in order to maintain safety and a sufficient runway throughput. It is important that the calculations of the inter-arrival times at the threshold and IAF are as accurate as possible. If the inter-arrival time for each aircraft is wrongly increased by five to ten seconds, the throughput decreases with two landings per hour. It is meaningful to take this into account when a dynamic time based separation for the threshold is calculated and compensated for strong headwinds. The definition of runway pressure suggests that there is a minimum amount of delay that should be left for the approach controller to absorb, in order to guarantee sufficient runway throughput. From the results of this research, it can be concluded that there will always be a minimum amount of delay that needs to be absorbed in the TMA to optimize the landing sequence. However, the minimum amount of delay in the TMA is a consequence of the difference in flight time between aircraft types and the accuracy of the actual time passing the IAF. If the inter-arrival times at the IAF are set correctly, a minimum amount of delay is not required to maintain sufficient runway throughput. Although a minimum amount of delay in the TMA is not required to maintain runway throughput, not all delay can always be absorbed in earlier flight phases. Therefore, it is recommended to investigate the effect on the workload of air traffic controllers and the delay absorption capacity of the different airspace sectors along the route. If the expected delay is divided and absorbed in the different flight phases along the trajectory towards the airport, the arrival process is easier to manage for all controllers involved.

Participants predicted the ball 2 ̆ 7 s landing location by placing a 1 / 4 " dot on a paper diagram of a tennis court and circling their level of response confidence. ^ Results found the BM condition was perceived more accurately than the LM condition along the x- and y-axes and in angular direction.
