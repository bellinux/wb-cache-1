5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000–40,000 {{people were}} killed outright by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000–80,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia, with an <b>attributable</b> <b>risk</b> of 46% for bomb victims. Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation. Most of the direct deaths and injuries sustained from the bombing were munitions or industrial workers. Mitsubishi's industrial production in the city were also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steel works would have required {{a year to get}} back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the restoration of the arms plant to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity would have required 15 months.

[...] between {{the years of}} 1988 and 1991 has found a correlation between Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates (TSP) and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing. A group of 74,671 pregnant women, in four separate regions of Beijing, were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of Sulfur Dioxide and TSP (along with other particulates). [...] The estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g for every 100µg/m3 increase in SO2 and 6.9g for each 100µg/m3 increase in TSP. These associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter, although, summer was greater. The proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution, was 13%.

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of the association between exposure and response is central to identifying causality in medical research. The concentration index has been commonly used to study income inequality and socioeconomic related health inequality. This study generalizes applications of the concentration index to measure the relative and <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> for describing exposure-response relationships in medical research. Based on cumulative distribution functions, a new measure of correlation is proposed to quantify the association between exposure and response. The connection between the new and existing measures is discussed. The method enables the semi-parametric analysis of overall association and disparity by risk factors. Both grouped and continuous data situations are considered with two applications. The first example illustrates {{the relationships between the}} concentration index, relative and <b>attributable</b> <b>risks.</b> The second example demonstrates how the concentration index can assist in evaluating the association between the radiation dose and the incidence of leukaemia.

The odds ratio (OR) of perinatal death associated with pesticide exposure was estimated using multiple logistic regression. There was a consistent and significant association between pesticide exposure and perinatal mortality in the hospital (adjusted OR = 1. 9; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 3 - 2. 8) and the community populations (adjusted OR = 2. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 6. 4).

40|$|The Exxon Valdez {{oil spill}} {{occurred}} {{more than two}} decades ago, and the Prince William Sound ecosystem has essentially recovered. Nevertheless, discussion con-tinues on whether or not localized effects persist on sea otters (Enhydra lutris) at northern Knight Island (NKI) and, if so, what are the associated <b>attributable</b> <b>risks.</b> A recent study estimated new rates of sea otter encounters with subsurface oil residues (SSOR) from the oil spill. We previously demonstrated that a potential pathway existed for exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and conducted a quantitative ecological risk assessment using an individual-based model that simu-lated this and other plausible exposure pathways. Here we quantitatively update the potential for this exposure pathway to constitute an ongoing risk to sea otters using the new estimates of SSOR encounters. Our conservative model predicted that the assimilated doses of PAHs to the 1 -in- 1000 th most-exposed sea otters would remain 1 – 2 orders of magnitude below the chronic effects thresholds. We re-examine the baseline estimates, post-spill surveys, recovery status, and <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> for this subpopulation.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Smoking, hypertension, alcohol consumption, {{autosomal}} dominant {{polycystic kidney disease}} (ADPKD), and positive family history for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are well-known risk factors for SAH. For effective prevention, knowledge about the contribution of these risk factors to the overall occurrence of SAH {{in the general population}} is pivotal. We therefore investigated the population <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> of the risk factors for SAH. Methods—We retrieved the relative risk and prevalence of established risk factors for SAH from the literature and calculated the population <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> of these risk factors. Results—Drinking alcohol 100 to 299 g/wk accounted for 11 % of the cases of SAH, drinking alcohol $ 300 g/wk accounted for 21 %, and smoking accounted for 20 %. An additional 17 % of the cases could be attributed to hypertension, 11 % to a positive family history for SAH, and 0. 3 % to ADPKD. Conclusions—Screening and preventive treatment of patients with familial preponderance of SAH alone will cause a modest reduction of the incidence of SAH in the general population. Further reduction can be achieved by reducing the prevalence of the modifiable risk factors alcohol consumption, smoking, and hypertension. (Stroke. 2001; 32 : 1173 - 1175.)

40|$|Background: This paper {{analyses}} {{the direct}} medical costs of {{type 2 diabetes}} and its complications in Switzerland. Methods: Individual healthcare resource consumption related to type 2 diabetes and its complications was determined retrospectively in 1479 non-incident and non-dying patients over 12 months (1998 - 1999). Literature-derived <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> were used to correct for non-diabetes related macrovascular disease. Results: A total of 111 primary care physicians from 19 cantons throughout Switzerland participated. Their diabetic patients on average had 10. 3 consultations per year related to this disease (95 % CI: 10. 0 - 10. 7). Patients spent on average 2. 7 days (95 % CI: 2. 2 - 3. 3) per year in hospital due to diabetes and diabetes-related complications. Mean annual type 2 diabetes-related direct medical costs per patient amounted to CHF 3, 508 / € 2, 323 (95 % CI: CHF 3, 140 - 3, 876 / € 2, 080 - 2, 567). They were particularly high in patients with insulin treatment or with complications. After application of <b>attributable</b> <b>risks</b> and a correction {{for the use of}} adjuvant materials, costs were CHF 3, 324 / € 2, 201. Assuming 250, 000 patients with type 2 diabetes in Switzerland leads to an estimate of CHF 0. 88 billion spent for this disease and its complications in 1998. This represents a share of about 2. 2 % of the country's total healthcare expenditures.
