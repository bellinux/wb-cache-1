25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on Pretty on the Inside: [...] "I was blonde, wore makeup, had to support my band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work... so I took, you know, high heels and white pumps, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wiglet—I just took that and messed with it." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Gaga {{revealed}} on The Howard Stern Show {{that she}} was raped at age 19 by a producer twenty years older than her. During her conversation with Stern, the singer recalled, [...] "I went through some horrific things. I'm able to laugh now because I've gone {{through a lot of}} mental, physical and emotional therapy [...] I wasn't even willing to admit that anything had even happened [...] I saw him one time in a store, and I was paralyzed by fear." [...] She confirmed that the incident further inspired [...] "Swine", saying, [...] "I wrote a song called 'Swine'; the song is about rape. The song is about demoralization. The song is about rage and fury and passion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of pain that I wanted to release." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kim Manners, who was extremely pleased with the final result. He explained, [...] "it {{was a lot of}} fun to shoot that show.

[...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner. Manners was inspired by the 1939 film adaption of The Wizard of Oz, most specifically the image of [...] " [...] the Scarecrow, and the Tinman, and the Lion [...] shaking behind Dorothy." [...] Manners later noted that the sequence [...] "really worked out well".|$|E

[...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All I have to do is party and have a good time."

It said, and I'm paraphrasing here: 'Security is {{in the shape of a}} {{kidney-shaped}} pool in Los Angeles, where you sit waiting for your residual checks.' I was in a comfortable spot on Knots, and an artist should not be comfortable. I'd forgotten that there was a character I'd loved for 13 years. She was the seed of the show. I am the sole person to spin off from Dallas (because actor David Ackroyd originated the role of Gary on that show). Valene gave Knots a note of spirituality. There was a heart that was Valene. I hope they treat her with respect, that she is seen out with a resolution she deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the ending}} of his story, Munroe {{explained}} many of its details and furthered its context in an article on Wired. He noted that [...] "Time" [...] is set 11,000 years in the future, in a future civilization with humanity's present civilization long extinct. It {{takes place in the}} basin of the Mediterranean Sea, which has largely evaporated following tectonic activity shutting it off from the Atlantic Ocean. This is modeled after a similar occurrence of this incident approximately 5 million years ago—the Messinian salinity crisis. The eventual flooding crisis {{at the end of the}} story is a supposed recurrence of the Zanclean flood. Munroe reportedly researched the plants and wildlife of the region and added them into the comic, offering hints as to the story's location. According to Munroe, [...] "I got suggestions from botanists and herpetologists, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> file with details on every species the characters encountered or talked about, like dwarf palms, juniper trees, horned vipers, and sand boas".|$|E

500|$|Brosnan left Ireland on 12 August 1964 and was {{reunited with}} his mother and her new husband, William Carmichael, now living in the Scottish village of Longniddry, East Lothian. Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves pretty fast. From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; the British have a wonderful way of doing that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> certain deep sense of being an outsider."

500|$|In September 2012, {{following}} {{the hiring of}} former General Hospital executive producer Jill Farren Phelps onto the series, Francis was let go from the soap opera due to budgetary cuts from Sony Pictures Television and CBS.

When asked specifically about reports indicating Francis' dismissal, she said: [...] "Genie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wonderful talk when I came to Y and I think we're really quite fond of each other. She's a magnificent actress." [...] Despite confirmations that the actress' dismissal was due to budgetary reasons, Jillian Bowe of Zap2it reported a rumor that [...] "the veteran's tenure on the show wasn't well-received by the brass at CBS and Sony". Sara Bibel of Xfinity reported another rumor about her dismissal, saying it was [...] "no secret" [...] that Francis and Phelps [...] "did not get along" [...] while both worked on General Hospital, and that [...] "few are surprised that the two were not eager to work together again".|$|E

He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass.

500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder.
