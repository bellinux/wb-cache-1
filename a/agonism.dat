5|$|Lemurs lack any shared {{traits that}} make them stand out from all other primates. Different types of lemurs have evolved unique {{combinations}} of unusual traits to cope with Madagascar's harsh, seasonal climate. These traits can include seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and strict breeding seasons. Extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding are also thought to {{have given rise to}} three other relatively common lemur traits: female social dominance, sexual monomorphism, and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of <b>agonism,</b> such as sperm competition.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial <b>agonism</b> prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{receptor}} involved, {{the chemical}} {{structure of the}} ligand and the tissue that is being affected, nuclear receptor ligands may display dramatically diverse effects ranging in a spectrum from <b>agonism</b> to antagonism to inverse <b>agonism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as {{milrinone}} {{are sometimes}} utilized in severe cardiomyopathy. The {{mechanism of action}} is through inhibiting the breakdown and thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP similar to beta adrenoreceptor <b>agonism,</b> resulting in inotropic effects and modest diuretic effects.|$|E
25|$|Fentanyl {{provides}} some of the effects typical of other opioids through its <b>agonism</b> of the opioid receptors. Its strong potency in relation to that of morphine is largely due to its high lipophilicity, per the Meyer-Overton correlation. Because of this, it can more easily penetrate the Central Nervous System.|$|E
25|$|When THC {{enters the}} blood stream and reaches the brain, it binds to {{cannabinoid}} receptors. The endogenous ligand of these receptors is anandamide, {{the effects of}} which THC emulates. This <b>agonism</b> of the cannabinoid receptors results in changes in the levels of various neurotransmitters, especially dopamine and norepinephrine; neurotransmitters which are {{closely associated with the}} acute effects of cannabis ingestion, such as euphoria and anxiety.|$|E
25|$|It {{acts as an}} agonist at the σ1 {{receptor}} with a low Ki of 2.6 µm (2600nm). The {{consequences of}} this activity are unclear (as the role of sigma receptors in general is not yet that well understood) and memantine is probably too weak at the sigma binding site to exhibit significant agonist effects, only exhibiting partial <b>agonism</b> or antagonism. Some of memantine's adverse effects arise through this route.|$|E
25|$|A new {{strategy}} of drug development takes receptor signal transduction into consideration. This strategy strives {{to increase the}} activation of desirable signalling pathways while reducing the impact on undesirable pathways. This differential strategy has been given several names, including functional selectivity and biased <b>agonism.</b> The first opioid that was intentionally designed as a biased agonist and placed into clinical evaluation is the drug oliceridine. It displays analgesic activity and reduced adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone acts {{predominantly}} as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist {{to mediate}} its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression. Its inhibitory effects on serotonin reuptake and 5-HT2C receptors are comparatively weak. Hence, trazodone {{does not have}} similar properties to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and is not particularly associated with increased appetite and weight gain, unlike other 5-HT2C antagonists like mirtazapine. Moderate 5-HT1A partial <b>agonism</b> is likely to contribute to trazodone's antidepressant and anxiolytic actions to some extent as well.|$|E
25|$|Quinolinic acid is a {{byproduct}} of the kynurenine pathway, {{which is responsible for}} catabolism of tryptophan in mammals. This pathway is important for its production of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and produces several neuroactive intermediates including quinolinic acid, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HANA). Quinolinic acid's neuroactive and excitatory properties are a result of NMDA receptor <b>agonism</b> in the brain. It also acts as a neurotoxin, gliotoxin, proinflammatory mediator, and pro-oxidant molecule.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{favorable}} {{to have a}} ring substitution at the 3-carboxamide group, such as the 1-piperidinyl group in rimonabant. Replacement of the amino piperidinyl substituent by alkyl amides, ethers, ketones, alcohols or alkanes resulted mostly in decreased affinity. Replacement of the piperidinyl by pentyl or a heptyl chain gave the compounds agonistic properties. Based on these results {{it was concluded that}} the pyrazole 3-position seems to be involved in <b>agonism,</b> while the 1-,4-,5-positions appear to be involved in antagonism.|$|E
25|$|With regular use, {{tolerance}} {{to the effects}} of barbiturates develops. As with all GABAergic drugs barbiturate withdrawal produces potentially fatal effects such as seizures in a manner reminiscent of delerium tremens and benzodiazepine withdrawal although its more direct mechanism of GABA <b>agonism</b> makes barbiturate withdrawal more severe than that of alcohol or benzodiazepines (subsequently {{making it one of the}} most dangerous withdrawals of any known addictive substance). Similar to benzodiazepines the longer acting barbiturates produce a less severe withdrawal syndrome than short acting and ultra short acting barbiturates. Withdrawal symptoms are dose-dependent with heavier users being affected worse than lower-dose addicts.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of partial <b>agonism</b> of the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor (and indirect/downstream activation of AMPA receptors), all of these actions are far weaker than ketamine's antagonism of the NMDA receptor (see table to the right; minimum of more than 10-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor relative to the site with the next highest affinity). A binding study assessed ketamine at 56sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters and found that ketamine had Ki values of >10,000nM at all sites except the dizocilpine site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 659nM), indicating a minimum of 15-fold selectivity for the NMDA receptor over any other site.|$|E
25|$|Buspirone {{acts as an}} agonist of the {{serotonin}} 5-HT1A receptor {{with high}} affinity. It is a preferential full agonist of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and a partial agonist of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In accordance, an animal study found that buspirone dose-dependently decreases serotonin levels in specific brain areas while increasing dopamine and norepinephrine levels. It is thought that the main effects of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor. Some of its effects may be mediated via oxytocin release secondary to 5-HT1A receptor <b>agonism.</b> Buspirone also has lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors.|$|E

An agonist action has been determined at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C. Its efficacies at other serotonin receptors remain to be determined. Of special interest will be the determination of its efficacy at human 5-HT2B receptor as two in vitro assays evidenced DMT's high affinity for this receptor: 0.108 μM and 0.184 μM. This may be of importance because chronic or frequent uses of serotonergic drugs showing preferential high affinity and clear <b>agonism</b> at 5-HT2B receptor have been causally linked to valvular heart disease.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{studies have}} {{consistently}} associated medical and recreational opioid use with hypogonadism and hormone imbalance in different sexes. The effect is dose-dependent. Most {{studies suggest that}} the majority (perhaps as much as 90%) of chronic opioid users suffer hormone imbalances. Opioids can also interfere with menstruation in women by limiting the production of luteinizing hormone (LH). Opioid-induced endocrinopathy likely causes the strong association of opioid use with osteoporosis and bone fracture. It also may increase pain and thereby interfere with the intended clinical effect of opioid treatment. Opioid-induced endocrinopathy is likely caused by their <b>agonism</b> of opioid receptors in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. One study found that the depressed testosterone levels of heroin addicts returned to normal within one month of abstinence, suggesting that the effect is not permanent. , the effect of low-dose or acute opiate use on the endocrine system is unclear.|$|E
25|$|While most GPCRs {{are capable}} of {{activating}} more than one Gα-subtype, they also show a preference for one subtype over another. When the subtype activated depends on the ligand that is bound to the GPCR, this is called functional selectivity (also known as agonist-directed trafficking, or conformation-specific <b>agonism).</b> However, the binding of any single particular agonist may also initiate activation of multiple different G-proteins, {{as it may be}} capable of stabilizing more than one conformation of the GPCR’s GEF domain, even {{over the course of a}} single interaction. In addition, a conformation that preferably activates one isoform of Gα may activate another if the preferred is less available. Furthermore, feedback pathways may result in receptor modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) that alter the G-protein preference. Regardless of these various nuances, the GPCR’s preferred coupling partner is usually defined according to the G-protein most obviously activated by the endogenous ligand under most physiological or experimental conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{atypical}} antipsychotics integrate {{with the}} serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (α, β), and dopamine (D) receptors {{in order to}} effectively treat schizophrenia. An activated 5-HT2A receptor upregulates the D2 receptor, which can cause schizophrenia in humans. Therefore, many antipsychotics block the 5-HT2A receptor. The affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor is often much, much higher compared to the D2 receptor in many antipsychotics. By blocking the 5-HT2A receptor the D2 receptor is downregulated but some antipsychotics give an added function by blocking the D2 receptor. Blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor releases dopamine in the brain just as with the 5-HT2C receptor. 5-HT2C activation blocks dopamine and inhibits norepinephrine release. Blockade of the 5-HT2C receptor increases serotonin, releasing norepinephrine and dopamine within the brain. But neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine is limited sharply by some antipsychotics, for example ziprasidone. Increased norepinephrine can cause increased glucose levels, {{which is to say}} blood sugar levels. Increased blood sugar levels by increased norepinephrine causes hunger in many humans, which is why weight gain occurs with some antipsychotics if the norepinephrine is not inhibited. Inhibition of norepinephrine stabilizes mood in humans. 5-HT6 receptor antagonists improve cognition, learning, and memory. receptors in learning and memory | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 29 | issue = 9 | pages = 482–92 | date = Sep 2008 | pmid = 19086256 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2008.07.001 }} The 5-HT7 receptor is very potent for the mitigation of bipolar conditions and also yields an antidepressant effect. The antipsychotics asenapine, lurasidone, risperidone, and aripiprazole are very potent at the 5-HT7 receptor. Antagonistic affinity for the H1 receptor also has an antidepressant effect. H1 antagonism blocks serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Patients with increased histamine levels have been observed to have lower serotonin levels. However, the H1 receptor is linked to weight gain. To have partial <b>agonism</b> at the 5-HT1A receptor can yield absence of weight gain in an antipsychotic. This is very relevant for ziprasidone, but it creates a risk for a prolonged QTc interval. On the other hand, blockade of the 5-HT3 receptor removes the risk for a prolonged QTc interval, but then creates a larger risk for weight gain. Relation to the 5-HT3 receptor increases caloric uptake and glucose, which is seen in clozapine and olanzapine. Other ways for dopamine to resolve is to have <b>agonism</b> at both the D2 receptor and 5-HT1A receptor, which normalizes the dopamine level in the brain. This occurs with haloperidol and aripiprazole.|$|E
25|$|Antagonism of the 5-HT2 {{subfamily}} of receptors and inverse <b>agonism</b> of the 5-HT2C receptor {{appears to}} be in part responsible for mirtazapine's efficacy in the treatment of depressive states. receptors as a target for the treatment of depressive and anxious states: focus on novel therapeutic strategies | journal = Thérapie | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 441–60 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16433010 | doi = 10.2515/therapie:2005065 }} The 5-HT2C receptor is known to inhibit the release of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine {{in various parts of the}} brains of rodents, notably in reward pathways such as the ventral tegmental area. receptors in the ventral tegmental area | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 146 | issue = 1 | pages = 286–97 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17367945 | pmc = 1939890 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.12.071 }} Accordingly, it was shown that by blocking the α2-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT2C receptors mirtazapine disinhibited dopamine and norepinephrine activity in these areas in rats. In addition, mirtazapine's antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has beneficial effects on anxiety, sleep and appetite, as well as sexual function regarding the latter receptor.

500|$|In general, {{levels of}} <b>agonism</b> (or aggression) tend to {{correlate}} with relative canine height. The ring-tailed lemur has long, sharp upper canine teeth in both sexes, {{and it also}} exhibits high levels of <b>agonism.</b> The Indri, on the other hand, has smaller canines and exhibits lower levels of aggression. When neighboring groups {{of the same species}} defend their territories, the conflict can take the form of ritualized defense. In sifakas, these ritualized combats involve staring, growling, scent-marking, and leaping to occupy certain sections of the tree. The indri defends its home range with ritualized [...] "singing" [...] battles.|$|E
500|$|Having {{evolved in}} Madagascar's {{challenging}} environment, replete with poor soils, extreme shifts in poor, seasonal plant productivity, and devastating climatic {{events such as}} extended droughts and annual cyclones, lemurs have adopted unique combinations of unusual traits to survive, distinguishing them significantly from other primates. [...] In response to limited, seasonal resources, lemurs may exhibit seasonal fat storage, hypometabolism (including torpor and hibernation in some cheirogaleids), small group sizes, low encephalization (relative brain size), cathemerality (activity both day and night), and/or strict breeding seasons. [...] Secondarily, extreme resource limitations and seasonal breeding {{are thought to have}} resulted in three other relatively common lemur traits: female dominance, sexual monomorphism (lack of size differences between the sexes), and male–male competition for mates involving low levels of <b>agonism</b> (conflict), such as sperm competition.|$|E
500|$|Serotonin is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{involved in}} multiple states including aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and vomiting. In humans {{the effects of}} excess serotonin were first noted in 1960 in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and tryptophan. The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the central nervous system. It was originally suspected that <b>agonism</b> of 5-HT1A receptors in central grey nuclei and the medulla {{was responsible for the}} development of the syndrome. Further study has determined that overstimulation of primarily the 5-HT2A receptors appears to contribute substantially to the condition. The 5-HT1A receptor may still contribute through a pharmacodynamic interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes. Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS norepinephrine concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may also play a role; NMDA receptor antagonists and GABA have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome. [...] Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and overdoses, and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.|$|E
500|$|All of the extinct subfossil lemurs, {{including}} the smallest species (Pachylemur, Mesopropithecus, {{and the giant}} aye-aye), were larger than the lemur species alive today. The largest species were among the largest primates ever to have evolved. Due to their larger size, the extinct subfossil lemurs have been compared to large-bodied anthropoids (monkeys and apes), yet they more closely resemble the small-bodied lemurs. [...] Like other lemurs, the subfossil lemurs did not exhibit appreciable differences in body or canine tooth size {{between males and females}} (sexual dimorphism). [...] This suggests that they, too, exhibited female social dominance, possibly exhibiting the same levels of <b>agonism</b> (aggressive competition) seen in extant lemurs. [...] Like other lemurs, they had smaller brains than comparably sized anthropoids. [...] Most species also had a unique strepsirrhine dental trait, called a toothcomb, which is used for grooming. Even tooth development and weaning was rapid compared to similarly sized anthropoids, suggesting faster sexual maturity of their offspring. Most subfossil lemurs also had high retinal summation (sensitivity to low light), resulting in poor day vision (low visual acuity) compared to anthropoids. This has been demonstrated by the ratio between their relatively small orbits (eye sockets) and the relative size of their optic canal, which is comparable to that of other lemurs, not diurnal anthropoids.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that the antihypertensive effect of clonidine is due to <b>agonism</b> on the I1 receptor (imidazoline receptor), which mediates the sympatho-inhibitory actions of imidazolines to lower blood pressure.|$|E
2500|$|D1 {{receptor}} <b>agonism</b> and D2 receptor blockade {{also increases}} mRNA translation by phosphorylating ribosomal protein s6, resulting in activation of mTOR. [...] The behavioral implications are unknown. [...] Dopamine receptors may also regulate ion channels and BDNF independent of cAMP, possibly through direct interactions. [...] There {{is evidence that}} D1 receptor <b>agonism</b> regulates phospholipase C independent of cAMP, however implications and mechanisms remain poorly understood. [...] D2 receptor signaling may mediate protein kinase B, arrestin beta 2, and GSK-3 activity, and inhibition of these proteins results in stunting of the hyperlocomotion in amphetamine treated rats. [...] Dopamine receptors can also transactivate Receptor tyrosine kinases.|$|E
2500|$|The {{associations}} between biologically relevant molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids {{play a central}} role in signal transduction.

[...] The opioid antagonist activity of Nalbuphine is one-fourth as potent as nalorphine and 10 times that of pentazocine.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very small}} number of cases {{involving}} non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are [...] "non-abusable" [...] and generally have low abuse potential. Nonetheless due to their atypical MOA, amineptine and tianeptine (dopamine reuptake inhibition and μ-opioid receptor <b>agonism,</b> respectively) are the two TCAs with the highest addiction and abuse potential. Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of dosulepin with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} drugs that work through nuclear receptors display an agonist {{response}} in some tissues and an antagonistic response in other tissues. This behavior may have substantial benefits since it may allow retaining the desired beneficial therapeutic effects of a drug while minimizing undesirable side effects. [...] Drugs with this mixed agonist/antagonist profile of action {{are referred to as}} selective receptor modulators (SRMs). [...] Examples include Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs), Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) and Selective Progesterone Receptor Modulators (SPRMs). [...] The mechanism of action of SRMs may vary depending on the chemical structure of the ligand and the receptor involved, however it is thought that many SRMs work by promoting a conformation of the receptor that is closely balanced between <b>agonism</b> and antagonism. [...] In tissues where the concentration of coactivator proteins is higher than corepressors, the equilibrium is shifted in the agonist direction. [...] Conversely in tissues where corepressors dominate, the ligand behaves as an antagonist.|$|E
2500|$|Morphine, {{the archetypal}} opioid, and other opioids (e.g., codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, dihydromorphine, pethidine) all exert a similar {{influence}} on the cerebral opioid receptor system. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, and tramadol is a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) with weak μ-opioid receptor agonist properties. [...] Tramadol is structurally closer to venlafaxine than to codeine and delivers analgesia by not only delivering [...] "opioid-like" [...] effects (through mild <b>agonism</b> of the mu receptor) but also by acting as a weak but fast-acting serotonin releasing agent and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. [...] Tapentadol, with some structural similarities to tramadol, presents what {{is believed to be}} a novel drug working through two (and possibly three) different modes of action in the fashion of both a traditional opioid and as a SNRI. The effects of serotonin and norepinephrine on pain, while not completely understood, have had causal links established and drugs in the SNRI class are commonly used in conjunction with opioids (especially tapentadol and tramadol) with greater success in pain relief. Dosing of all opioids may be limited by opioid toxicity (confusion, respiratory depression, myoclonic jerks and pinpoint pupils), seizures (tramadol), but opioid-tolerant individuals usually have higher dose ceilings than patients without tolerance.|$|E

Although this usage of <b>Agonism</b> has been largely ignored it has been explored at some length by Claudio Colaguori in Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination. For Colaguori, [...] "the tampon is literally the arena of competition, the scene of contest, and the lust of adversarial conflict. The philosophy of <b>agonism</b> affirms the idea that transcendence, truth, and growth are generated from {{the outcome of the}} contest...the concept of <b>agonism</b> is often understood in an affirmative sense as the generative principle of economy, society and even natural ecology and personal growth...
