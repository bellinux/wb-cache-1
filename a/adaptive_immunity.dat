However, the functional consequences of the complex interplay between fungal morphogenesis and TLR signaling in vivo remain largely undefined. In this study we evaluate the impact of the IL- 1 R/TLR/myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD 88) -dependent signaling pathway on the innate and <b>adaptive</b> Th <b>immunities</b> to C. albicans and A. fumigatus in vivo. It was found that 1) the MyD 88 -dependent pathway is required for resistance to both fungi; 2) the involvement of the MyD 88 adapter may occur through signaling by distinct members of the IL- 1 R/TLR superfamily, including IL- 1 R, TLR 2, TLR 4, and TLR 9, with the proportional role of the individual receptors varying depending on fungal species, fungal morphotypes, and route of infection; 3) individual TLRs and IL- 1 R activate specialized antifungal effector functions on neutrophils, which correlates with susceptibility to infection; and 4) MyD 88 -dependent signaling on dendritic cells is crucial for priming antifungal Th 1 responses. Thus, the finding that the innate and <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunities</b> to C. albicans and A. fumigatus require the coordinated action of distinct members of the IL- 1 R/TLR superfamily acting through MyD 88 makes TLR manipulation amenable to the induction of host resistance to fungi...|$|R

25|$|While most antivirals treat viral infection, {{vaccines}} are {{a preemptive}} {{first line of}} defense against pathogens.

25|$|Immunopathology is {{a branch}} of {{clinical}} pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system {{that can lead to}} more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation {{is a prime example of}} autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia. In all vertebrates, there are two different kinds of immune responses: Innate and <b>Adaptive</b> <b>immunity.</b> Innate immunity is used to fight off non-changing antigens and is therefore considered nonspecific. It is usually a more immediate response than the adaptive immune system, usually responding within minutes to hours. It is composed of physical blockades such as the skin, but also contains nonspecific immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T Cells, and basophils. The second for of immunity is <b>Adaptive</b> <b>immunity.</b> This form of immunity requires recognition of the foreign antigen before a response is produced. Once the antigen is recognized, a specific response is produced in order to destroy the specific antigen. Because of this idea, <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunity</b> is considered to be specific immunity. A key part of <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunity</b> that separates it from innate is the use of memory to combat the antigen in the future. When the antigen is originally introduced, the organism does not have any receptors for the antigen so it must generate them from the first time the antigen is present. The immune system then builds a memory of that antigen, which enables it to recognize the antigen quicker in the future and be able to combat it quicker and more efficiently. The more the system is exposed to the antigen, the quicker it will build up its responsiveness.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people become}} {{infected}} with EBV and gain <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunity.</b> In the United States, {{about half of}} all five-year-old children and about 90 percent of adults have evidence of previous infection. Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. In the United States and other developed countries, many people are not infected with EBV in their childhood years. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence, it causes infectious mononucleosis 35 to 50 percent of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} immune system, {{also known}} as the acquired immune system or, more rarely, as the specific immune system, is a subsystem of the overall immune system that is composed of highly specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminate pathogens or prevent their growth.

This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Like the innate system, the adaptive system includes both humoral immunity components and cell-mediated immunity components.|$|E

25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these foreign DNAs that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunity</b> to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} from mouse and human-based scientific studies of a broader diversity in CD4+ effector T helper cell subsets. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, {{have been identified as}} important negative regulators of <b>adaptive</b> <b>immunity</b> as they limit and suppresses the immune system to control aberrant immune responses to self-antigens; an important mechanism in controlling the development of autoimmune diseases. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are another distinct population of effector CD4+ T cells that develop from naive T cells post-antigen activation. Tfh cells are specialized in helping B cell humoral immunity as they are uniquely capable of migrating to follicular B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and provide them positive paracrine signals to enable the generation and recall production of high-quality affinity-matured antibodies. Similar to Tregs, Tfh cells also play a role in immunological tolerance as an abnormal expansion of Tfh cell numbers can lead to unrestricted autoreactive antibody production causing severe systemic autoimmune disorders.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the innate}} immune system, the {{adaptive}} immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>immunity</b> can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, chickenpox. The adaptive system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the adaptive system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; {{the effects of this}} may be hayfever, asthma or any other allergy. Antigens are any substances that elicit the adaptive immune response. The cells that carry out the adaptive immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes—antibody responses and cell mediated immune response—are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete antibodies, which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.|$|E

Induction of the MyD 88 -independent type I IFN response to LPS is defective in the pulmonary environment. Moreover, in the absence of MyD 88, LPS-induced upregulation of costimulatory molecule expression on pulmonary DCs is defective, in contrast to what has been observed with bone marrow–derived DCs (BMDCs). Reconstitution of Th 2 responses occurs upon adoptive pulmonary transfer of activated BMDCs to MyD 88 -deficient recipients. Furthermore, the dependence of Th 2 responses on MyD 88 is governed by the initial route of antigen exposure; this demonstrates what we believe are novel site-specific innate mechanisms for control of <b>adaptive</b> Th 2 <b>immunity...</b>|$|R
