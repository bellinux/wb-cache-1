5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of orthodontics, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E
5|$|The man is now standing, his <b>arms</b> <b>crossed,</b> {{and watches}} with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E

25|$|Man with a Pipe is an oil {{painting}} on canvas with dimensions 93.7 × 65.4cm (36.5 by 25.75 inches), signed JMetzinger lower right. The work represents a man {{sitting at a}} table upon which is placed a mug of beer. The man, an American according to the title of the work, has his <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> and has a pipe in his mouth. He wears a jacket and tie. To the right is a vase with a painting of a sail boat in front of a setting sun above. To the sitters left can be seen half of a portrait in a round frame. While the Man with a Pipe is treated in an extreme form of Cubism, the two works hanging on the wall behind the sitter are not Cubist at all, albeit, they are stylized. One represents a boat with a setting or rising sun, the other, a portrait placed in a semi-circle, almost an echo of the Man with a Pipe.|$|E
25|$|Early {{symptoms}} {{may include}} loss of precision muscle coordination (sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship, frequent small injuries to the hands, and dropped items), cramping pain with sustained use, and trembling. Significant muscle pain and cramping {{may result from}} very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages. It may become {{difficult to find a}} comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome. Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing, or the need to place hands in pockets, under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain. Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down, and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth, or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder. The voice may crack frequently or become harsh, triggering frequent throat clearing. Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping.|$|E
25|$|With his <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> and {{his head}} {{slightly}} lowered as he skates from right to left, Grant dominates the canvas. The dramatic impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wind load {{is the key}} and {{sensitive}} for tower structure but national standards {{tend to think that}} level stiffness change of cup type transmission tower is uniform along the height. The structure stiffness change of cup type transmission tower was simulated innovatively and found its nonuniformity. The result shows that the structural stiffness uniformly changes along the height when the flow direction parallel to the <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> while the stiffness of crank <b>arm</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>arm</b> has mutations when the flow direction is vertical to the <b>cross</b> <b>arm.</b> Horizontal stiffness change causes a significant change of wind vibration coefficient.

500|$|During the {{following}} months, Jesús Dávila of NCM Noticias began circulating seven {{questions for the}} EPB. On October 12, 2010, the responses attributed to Comandante Guasábara were published by that journalist. In response to the organization's role in the political environment during that particular juncture, the Macheteros expressed {{that they were being}} [...] "patient and responsible", [...] "hearing the complaints of the people" [...] and warning that [...] "their patience and passiveness were reaching an end". The group claimed that they had obtained information related to government corruption and the influence of foreign interests that pressured them to act, since [...] "standing still with their <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> [...] violate their elemental [...] as an armed revolutionary organization", warning that they no longer intended to [...] "scream slogans" [...] at rallies, but were instead waiting [...] "to strike the adequate objective at the adequate time and place". When questioned about a draft announced by the organization some time prior to the interview, Guasábara responded by noting that [...] "being at war, the existence of Machetero comandos and permanent recruitment will be necessary [...] until we declare the Republic." [...] The EPB described its strategy as one that evolved in three steps emerging from the rearguard; the first being the defensive {{as a response to the}} enemy's offensive, the second being a period of strategic consolidation and preparation of a counterattack plan and the third being the implementation of this plan in contrast to the government's politics.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "The Silence" [...] was {{directed}} by Nzingha Stewart before the video for [...] "All Night Long" [...] was shot. The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props. It begins with a couple of establishing shots of Burke of her posing with a balloon wearing and in another set where she is sitting on music speakers. Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics. Prior to the first chorus, a new set is introduced of Burke wearing a black dress which exposes all of her back while sitting {{on the floor next to}} a stereo. During the first verse, all three sets show Burke carrying out different tasks with he props, as well as a new set where she sits in front of a white backdrop in a plain white oversized shirt. As the second verse begins, the set of Burke sitting on the floor next to a stereo changes to that of her standing up in front of a microphone singing the lyrics, with the backdrop of a city skyline. During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her <b>arms</b> <b>crossed</b> over her chest.|$|E
