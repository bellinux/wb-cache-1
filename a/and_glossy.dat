5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar: This {{subspecies}} {{grows in}} coastal Queensland {{as far north}} as Proserpine. For most of its range it is the only subspecies, but near its southern limit it co-occurs with B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. The two subspecies are distinguishable by their leaves, which are larger <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> with wavy margins on B.integrifolia subsp. compar.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|Some Scotch bonnets have a {{completely}} smooth <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> shell. This {{was thought to}} be a different species which was given the name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this is considered to be only a form, therefore S. cicatricosa has become another synonym of S. granulata.|$|E

5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can be readily peeled away from the flesh.|$|E
5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|Within the genus, the yellow-tailed {{and the two}} Western Australian white-tailed species, the short-billed and long-billed black cockatoo, {{form the}} {{subgenus}} Zanda. The red-tailed <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoos form the other subgenus, Calyptorhynchus. The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile food begging calls {{and the degree of}} sexual dimorphism. Males and females of the latter group have markedly different plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

25|$|In either standard, {{the coat}} {{should be very}} short, fine <b>and</b> <b>glossy,</b> with a satin-like finish. Color is solid and must be uniform over the body, only {{gradually}} shading to lighter underparts. Faint colorpoint markings may be visible, but any barring or spotting is considered a serious fault. The eyes are green or gold depending on coat color.|$|E

25|$|The {{shape of}} the shell is valvatiform. The shell is {{thin-walled}} <b>and</b> <b>glossy.</b> The shell has 2–2.5 rapidly but regularly growing whorls. The spire is low or very low. The umbilicus is very wide, with the earlier whorls visible inside. The teleoconch is very finely sculptured with weakly marked growth lines. The protoconch has about 1¼ whorls growing slowly; {{the border between the}} proto- and teleoconch is indistinct; the protoconch surface is nodular.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings are darker <b>and</b> more <b>glossy</b> than in Rhinoprora palpata, the green shades almost suppressed {{except in the}} lines which bound the basal patch and the broad median band. The hindwings are more <b>glossy</b> <b>and</b> more smoky than in palpata. They are weakly marked.|$|R

25|$|This type of {{ecosystem}} is {{noted for its}} variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), greylag goose (Anser anser), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great white egret (Egretta alba), little egret (Egretta garzetta), eurasian spoonbill(Platalea leucorodia), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), mute swan (Cygnus olor), <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).|$|E
25|$|With {{occasional}} exceptions, a male tinamou {{maintains a}} territory and a nesting site during the breeding season which {{a succession of}} females will visit, laying their eggs in the same nest. Females will wander through several territories mating with, and laying eggs in the nests of, the resident males. Nests are always on the ground, concealed in vegetation or among rocks. Eggs are relatively large <b>and</b> <b>glossy,</b> often brightly colored when laid, and are incubated by the males {{for a period of}} 2–3 weeks. The chicks can run soon after hatching and are largely self-sufficient at three weeks old.|$|E
25|$|The black-necked stork (Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus) {{is a tall}} long-necked {{wading bird}} in the stork family. It is a {{resident}} species across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia with a disjunct population in Australia. It lives in wetland habitats and certain crops such as rice and wheat where it forages {{for a wide range}} of animal prey. Adult birds of both sexes have a heavy bill and are patterned in white <b>and</b> <b>glossy</b> blacks, but the sexes differ in the colour of the iris. In Australia, it is sometimes called a jabiru although that name refers to a stork species found in the Americas. It is one of the few storks that is strongly territorial when feeding.|$|E

25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{is light}} brown <b>and</b> <b>glossy.</b> Like any arthropod, its body {{contains}} three sections. The first part {{is called the}} prosoma while the middle part is called the mesosoma, and the posterior part is called the metasoma. The dorsum, or posterior side, of the mesosoma on Camponotus anderseni is flattened. It also has distinct metanotum on the posterior of the thorax. It is lacking erect setae under its head, and its body is slightly raised on the tibiae, or fourth joint of each leg. Its eyes elongate looking outward, nearer to the mandibles than the vertex. It is dimorphic, meaning there are two separate forms based on class. In major workers, the clypeus is depressed and finely punctate. The anterior margin is convex. In minor workers, the clypeus is wide, and the anterior margin is convex and projecting.|$|E
25|$|All coffee {{plants are}} {{classified}} in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5m (15ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green <b>and</b> <b>glossy,</b> usually 10–15cm (4–6in) long and 6cm (2.4in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at base to form interpetiolar stipules, characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5cm (0.6in). When immature they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries have only one; these are called peaberries. Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta take nine to eleven months.|$|E
