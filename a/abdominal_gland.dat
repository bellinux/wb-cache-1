50|$|Salamanders are not {{vocal and}} in most species the sexes look alike, so they use {{olfactory}} and tactile cues to identify potential mates, and sexual selection does occur. Pheromones play {{an important part in}} the process and may be produced by the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> in males and by the cloacal glands and skin in both sexes. Males are sometimes to be seen investigating potential mates with their snouts. In Old World newts, Triturus spp., the males are sexually dimorphic and display in front of the females. Visual cues are also thought to be important in some Plethodont species.|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha), {{prostaglandin}} E 2 (PGE 2), progesterone, androgens, and 17 beta-estradiol {{in vitro}} release by the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> of the crested newt, Triturus carnifex (Laur.), was studied during the prereproductive, reproductive and postreproductive periods. In addition, the in vitro {{effects of the}} PGF 2 alpha and/or PGE 2 on progesterone, androgens and estradiol release by the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> were evaluated. PGF 2 alpha, PGE 2 and progesterone release was higher during the reproductive period, {{and in the same}} period, PGE 2 treatment induced a progesterone increase. PGF 2 alpha induced an increase of <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> estradiol release {{at the end of the}} reproductive period. These results seemed to confirm the pheromonal role assigned to progesterone, and suggested a PGE 2 stimulatory role in inducing progesterone release, even if pheromonal activity of PGF 2 alpha and PGE 2 cannot be excluded. In addition, PGF 2 alpha-dependent estradiol increase at the end of reproduction could be interpreted as a mechanism for interruption of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> activity...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{arginine}} vasotocin (AVT) on reproductive {{events such}} as courtship behavior, pheromone release, and spermatophore discharge were investigated in the male newt Cynops pyrrhogaster. AVT enhanced the incidence and frequency of androgen-induced courtship behavior. In this case, AVT was likely to act centrally because the behavior was evoked with a much smaller amount of AVT when the hormone was administered intracerebroventricularly than when given intraperitoneally. Involvement of endogenous AVT in spontaneously occurring courtship behavior was also evidenced {{by the fact that}} administration of a V 1 (vasopressor) receptor antagonist, [d(CH 2) 51, Tyr(Me) 2, Arg 8 -vasopressin] suppressed the expression of the courtship behavior. The water in which AVT-treated males had been kept showed considerable female-attracting activity as compared with the water in which saline-injected males had been kept. Moreover, the content of sodefrin, a female-attracting pheromone in the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland,</b> was decreased by the intraperitoneal injection of AVT, suggesting that the neurohypophyseal hormone stimulated the release of sodefrin from the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> into the water. AVT induced contraction of the excised <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> concentration-dependently, and, again, the V 1 receptor antagonist suppressed the AVT-induced contraction. Thus, we concluded that AVT induces the pheromone discharge, acting peripherally on a contractile structure of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland.</b> AVT was also found to induce spermatophore deposition in the male kept {{in the absence of the}} female. Administration of the V 1 receptor blocker to the sexually developed males suppressed the spermatophore deposition. All these results indicate the involvement o...|$|E

In this case report, a 10 year-old female mix breed dog, spayed before first heat, showed to private veterinary practice with two mammary nodules on the right mammary chain. Complete unilateral mastectomy was performed and the formalin-fixed surgical specimen was submitted to pathology service. Routine hematoxylin and eosin histhopathological evaluation was performed. On the 1 st <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland,</b> the microscopic exam revealed a well circumscribed, unencapsulated nodule, compatible with lipoma.

These cells presented round pale nuclei, increased contour, prominent nucleoli and nuclear pleomorphism. Multinucleated giant cells and high mitotic rate were also seen. Some sections showed epithelial proliferations arranged in a tubulopapillary pattern. Since the myoepithelial component with malignant characteristics predominated as a distinct feature, the diagnosis of carcinoma and malignant myoepithelioma was established, according to Goldschmidt (2007), since this diagnosis was not possible according to previous classifications.

40|$|The annual {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the crested newt, Triturus carnifex, has been studied in the field. Temperatures, rainfall, humidity, and photoperiod were recorded throughout the year. Adult male and female newts were sampled monthly; snout vent lengths, crest heights of males, and body ovarian, oviducal, testicular, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> weights were recorded. Plasma samples were assayed for androgen, estradiol- 17 beta, and progesterone by radioimmunoassay and for vitellogenin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Air, deep water, water surface, and soil temperatures were low from October to March, but increased in April and May without consistent summer variations. Ovarian and oviducal weights increased in October to reach maximum values between January and March (reproductive period). Crest height and <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> weight in males mirrored the ovarian and oviducal pattern, while testicular weights were maximal in October and November. In females, plasma androgens were high during the reproductive period, and plasma estradiol peaked sharply in March, while plasma progesterone changed little. In the males plasma androgen and estradiol concentrations {{were similar to those}} of females, while plasma progesterone was significantly correlated with the cycle in testicular weight. In both sexes androgens showed a significantly negative correlation with air and water surface temperature. Plasma vitellogenin peaked in March but it did not correlate with either ovarian weight or plasma estradiol concentrations. These data support and confirm those previously reported for newts under laboratory conditions. The negative correlation between androgens and temperature suggests that this hormone may trigger the reproductive process. Moreover the correlations between plasma progesterone and testicular weight may indicate that this hormone is involved in male newts reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 An ancient pheromonal {{signal is}} found in aquatic courting salamandrids and {{terrestrial}} courting plethodontids, two highly divergent salamander families. In the aquatic courting salamandrids Cynops pyrrhogaster and C. ensicauda, the decapeptide sodefrin is cleaved from a larger 189 amino acid Sodefrin Precursor Factor (SPF) protein and released from a gland in the male’s cloaca during courtship. This decapeptide is capable of attracting females in a species-specific manner. In contrast, males of some terrestrial courting plethodontids apply uncleaved SPF directly to females to increase receptivity during courtship. In this study, we examine the presence, diversification, and evolution of this pheromone in two aquatic courting North American salamandrids, Notophthalmus viridescens and Taricha granulosa. We used degenerate primers, RT-PCR procedures, and cDNA obtained from sexually active males, in addition to genomic PCR methods. SPF {{was found to be}} expressed in <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> region cDNA by males of both species and was additionally expressed in hedonic (genial) gland tissue of N. viridescens males. With respect to the presence of a cleaved pheromone product in these species, multiple alignments with C. pyrrhogaster sequences demonstrated a high degree of variability in the putative decapeptide region. Cleavage sites were not identifiable.

40|$|The genus Pachycondyla is a {{large group}} of ants in the Ponerini tribe, known mostly from {{tropical}} and subtropical regions. Pachycondyla sennaarensis, the so-called Samsum ant in the Middle East, is distributed throughout the African tropics, Arabian Peninsula and Iran, where it is responsible for many cases of insect-induced dermal lesions and systemic reactions in humans. Populations of P. sennaarensis were studied in two regions of Iran and some aspects of their biology, ecology and medical importance are herein presented. Colonies of P. sennaarensis contain less than 850 workers that live in complicated underground galleries approximately one meter deep. Because of the harsh weather conditions of southern Iran, they can survive only in human disturbed habitats with higher humidity. Neither a real queen (without reproductive division of labor) nor a caste system is found in a P. sennaarensis colony. Observations indicated that P. sennaarensis is omnivorous, feeding on seeds of various plants, dead ants of other species, the larvae of dipterans and a few other invertebrates. The effect of the P. sennaarensis sting is usually mild, resulting in papule formation, erythema and dermal itching. The <b>abdominal</b> <b>gland</b> secretion of P. sennaarensis is a complex mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons and small amounts of terpenoids, ketones, pyrazines and phenolic compounds that are accompanied by straight-chain hydrocarbons. So far, no case of anaphylaxis has been reported in Iran, a fact probably {{due to the lack of}} proteins in P. sennaarensis venom.

50|$|Nest {{predation}} on the wasp {{is minimal}} throughout its nesting season; however, {{when it does}} occur, it is mainly perpetrated by birds. Nevertheless, nest predation by vertebrates reaches its peak during the pre-emergence period when the nest is empty except for the foundress and is, as a result, undefended. Furthermore, such predation is a major contribution to nest failure. In these cases, often the nest is predated but the foundress survives, {{which leads to the}} creation of usurpers and joiners. Unlike with other Polistes species, ants do not often attack the nests of P. biglumis. Accordingly, P. biglumis releases a very reduced amount of anti-ants substance on to the pedicels of the nests.
