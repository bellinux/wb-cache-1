40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} an air segment in a {{sequential}} injection system to simultaneously improve the overlapping of the stacked zones and minimise dispersion. This strategy was developed for the determination of sulphate in natural <b>and</b> <b>wastewaters.</b> Barium chloride was used as a precipitating agent and the turbidity of the suspension formed was measured at 420 nm. Analysis was performed without sample pre-treatment and the system was able to monitor sulphate concentration at a rate of at least 20 determinations per hour. Slightly different analytical sequences were developed for natural <b>and</b> <b>wastewaters</b> in order to minimise specific interferences. Direct determination of sulphate was possible within a concentration range of 10 – 100 and 16 – 100 mg SO 42 − L− 1 for natural <b>and</b> <b>wastewaters,</b> respectively. Results obtained were comparable with those of the reference method with relative deviations lower than 5 %. Relative standard deviations between 1. 6 % and 3. 3 % were found...|$|R
