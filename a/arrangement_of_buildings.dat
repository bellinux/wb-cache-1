Starting {{with the late}} 7th century Hōryū-ji, temples began to move towards indigenous methods expressed by irregular ground plans that resulted in an asymmetric <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> greater use of natural materials such as cypress bark instead of roof tiling, and an increased awareness of natural environment with the placement of buildings among trees. This adaption was assisted by the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{began on}} Old Main in 1873 and was {{completed}} by 1875 in the Second Empire architectural style. Built with local brick and sandstone, Old Main serves as the university's signature building. The building has remained on campus despite its recommended removal in the 1925 master plan from the architects of Jamieson and Spearl. This plan included destruction of all existing campus buildings and reconstruction in the Collegiate Gothic style. Several buildings were built in this style near the core of campus, including the Vol Walker Hall, Engineering Hall, Chemistry Building, Agriculture Building, and Home Economics Building. The plan ran out of funds and was never completed, leading to a somewhat haphazard <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> after the 1930s.|$|E

There is a dynamic to the place, the form and composition of which has been evolving since its inception. The principal elements of cultural heritage significance include: the spatial <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings,</b> structures, streets and green spaces; the two show rings; the grandstands including the John McDonald Stand, Ernest Baynes Stand, Council Stand, Members' Stand, Machinery Hill stands and Marshalling Yards Stand; interwar infrastructure such as toilet blocks, entrance gates, turnstiles, railway subway and perimeter walling; Sideshow Alley; the pavilions including the John Reid Pavilion, Industrial Pavilion and Dairy Industry Hall; buildings such as the Stock Agents' Office and Stockmen's Bar and Grill, the former Commonwealth Bank Building and the Gregory Terrace Entry Building; the numerous cattle, horse, dairy and pig pavilions and stabling and marshalling areas; and the shade trees (mainly mature Weeping Fig trees (Ficus benjamina)) scattered throughout the grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike early kami worship shrines, early Buddhist temples {{were highly}} {{ornamental}} and strictly symmetrical (see reconstruction of Asuka-dera above).

2500|$|Soon afterwards, {{he won a}} {{competition}} from Gentofte Municipality {{for the design of}} a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees. The focal point of the area {{was supposed to have been}} a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances. These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as [...] "The dream of the a modern lifestyle".|$|E

40|$|Poststructuralist {{theory of}} space argues that by {{investigating}} spatial issues, {{such as the}} <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{and the distribution of}} people and objects, it can reveal insights into the power hierarchies of people and places (Soja, 1996; Grosz, 1995; Foucault, 1977). In this paper, I adopt this premise to analyse the spaces of visual arts education. To do so, I explore two key areas that emerged from interviews with three secondary visual arts teachers: firstly, how the visual arts are positioned within schooling spaces; and secondly, how the spaces within the art classroom are constructed and negotiated. From this discussion, I examine the politics and tensions surrounding the positioning of visual arts education in secondary schooling contexts...|$|R

50|$|From {{the time}} the land was secured for the park nearly until the Conservatory {{construction}} began, {{the placement of the}} conservatory within the park was heavily debated. The advisory committee of the Parks Department favored a formal spatial <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> within the park, while the NYBG disagreed; they believed greater separation of the buildings would ease the management and supervision of crowds. Ultimately, the conservatory was placed away from other buildings in the park. At the time this was an unusual arrangement, as the conservatory had no axial or visual connection to the museum or any other buildings in the park.|$|E

50|$|In the {{document}} from 1327 {{there is also}} mentioned a gord, which can be linked with a subsequent wooden castle revealed in later documents. The settlement of Skoczów most probably emerged as its podgrodzie, a small locality serving it, which later evolved into a market settlement with irregular <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> centered on main oval square a few hundred meters north of nowadays Market Square, where later (but no earlier than late 1330s) a parish church was built. The location of the town around new Market Square under German rights took place hypothetically roughly at similar time as of Frýdek, in the late 14th century. The new town had regular <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> stretched towards the parish church in the north. It was surrounded with ramparts from wood and earth with two gates: Upper and Lower. Through the Upper Gate a path led towards Cieszyn in the east, through Lower towards Bielsko in the west. Behind the Upper Gate emerged the Upper Suburb, whereas {{on the right and}} eastern bank of Vistula River was located a Lower Suburb. In the beginning Skoczów was a small town, with around 450 citizens {{in the middle of the}} 15th century. It had been mainly an agricultural and craft trade settlement with much lower importance of trade. A local Catholic parish was first mentioned in the register of Peter's Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as Scotczowa.|$|E

The Weixinist Church insists that Yijing should be taught not only as a philosophical system, but as a practical tool for divination, and that fengshui goes beyond the harmonious <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> and furniture, and is in fact a complete system teaching how to live in harmony with nature.|$|E
50|$|Also in {{this case}} there are many {{different}} hypothetical reconstructions <b>of</b> the general <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> <b>of</b> this part of the Roman Forum. According to one, the Rostra podium was attached to the Temple of Divus Iulius and is actually the podium of the Temple of Divus Iulius with the rostra (the prow of a warship) attached in a frontal position. According to other reconstructions, the Rostra podium was a separate platform built west of the temple of Divus Iulius and directly in front of it, so the podium of the Temple of Divus Iulius is not the platform used by the orators for their speeches and not the platform used to attach the prows of ships taken at Actium. This separate and independent podium or platform, known as Rostra ad Divi Iuli, is also called Rostra Diocletiani, due to the final <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building.</b>|$|R

25|$|Little {{detailed}} {{work has}} yet been undertaken on how walls were constructed. The exception to this are the studies on the walls at Drosendorf, Zwettl, Horn and Freistadt. At Zwettl walls have been built in short sections, corresponding to adjacent burgage holdings, suggesting that particular length of wall was {{the responsibility of the}} burgage holder. The walls at Drosendorf do not appear to have been built by professional masons and there is widespread of use of Opus spicatum, a herringbone <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> stones, which also occurs in Romanesque church buildings. This contrasts with the walls at Grossenzersdorf, where masons from the Stephans Dom in Vienna built 2.2 kilometers of wall between 1396 and 1399, using reclaimed stone and tile from the Roman site at Carnuntum.|$|R
