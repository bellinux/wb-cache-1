In the, {{construction}} of these acts, troublesome questions have arisen, difficulties have been encountered, different theories urged, different views entertained, different conclusions reached, and different opinions rendered, respecting the number of actions that can be maintained under them, the circumstances that invoke one rather than the other, the measure of damages applicable, respectively, and certain questions of practice as to the joinder of counts and the <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pleadings.</b> The statement would hardly he justified that all these questions have finally been settled in this state; some of them undoubtedly are closed; others perhaps remain, open.

40|$|<b>Amendments</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{pleadings}}</b> at {{the early}} common law were rather liberally allowed. In ancient times, when the pleadings were by word of mouth, the parties were permitted to correct them during the oral altercation. Holdsworth states that 2 ̆ 2 a survival of the old idea that a pleader 2 ̆ 7 s words were not binding till avowed by his client no doubt made it the more possible to treat pleas as capable <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> till one was reached by which counsel would abide. 2 ̆ 2 But by the 14 th and 15 th centuries, as oral pleadings were superseded by written pleadings and formalism increased, abuses grew up and cases were constantly thrown out of court and judgments arrested and reversed for errors of form. It became necessary for Parliament to provide a remedy, and this it attempted to do {{by a series of}} statutes, called Statutes of Jeofails andAmendments...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{excellent}} handbook for lawyers and judges in the newly developed art of pre-trial. Over {{the last fifteen years}} there has been a steadily increasing interest in pre-trial conferences. Conducted by the judge with counsel before the actual trial, such conferences are geared to settle various matters which, in actuality, are not or need not be contested, and to strip the case {{to the heart of the}} precise dispute between the parties. Thus, simplification <b>of</b> the issues, <b>amendment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>pleadings</b> where necessary, admissions of fact and of documents as exhibits to avoid unnecessary proof, settlement of items of damage (such as hospital bills), limitation of the number of expert witnesses [...] all these and other matters formerly the subject of courtroom wrangling or haggling [...] are settled in advance with a minimum of friction and maximum of gain in trial expedition and efficiency. An important by-product, though properly approached more as a desirable consequence than as a compelled objective, is the settlement of the case without trial. Thus the system has proven a boon to courts facing overcrowded calendars and to litigants desiring the prompt and discriminating disposition of their disputes. This book shows, with a wealth of examples, how the courts most successful in operating this modern device proceed to make it work...|$|R

As {{set forth in the}} law review article, Involuntary Commitment and Forced Psychiatric Drugging in the Trial Courts: Rights Violations as a Matter of Course, by Jim Gottstein of PsychRights, 25 Alaska L. Rev. 51 (2008), "lawyers representing psychiatric respondents interpose little, if any, defense and are not discovering and presenting to judges the evidence of the harm to their clients.
