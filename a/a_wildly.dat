5|$|Lost Luggage is {{an action}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} skycap porters who are attempting to collect falling luggage from <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> unpredictable baggage carousel. The objective is to collect all the suitcases that fall from the carousel before they hit the ground. The player starts with three suitcases, which act as lives, and whenever a suitcase hits the floor, the player loses one. If all of the player's suitcases are lost, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> successful {{science fiction}} film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, {{like many other}} New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and was shocked {{to discover that the}} Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E

One night, during Too Cool's traditional post-match dance routine, Rikishi joined them. As the dance routines became more frequent and longer, this popularity translated to a significant push. In the 2000 Royal Rumble match, he eliminated seven opponents, and it took six wrestlers working together to eliminate him.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau {{had great}} {{influence on the}} work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> popular bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.|$|E
25|$|The Kurfürstendamm {{commercial}} district glitters with neon {{signs and}} reflected sun light, yet these citizens of Berlin use the street's full name {{in their daily}} lives, not the abbreviated slang of the native. Nazi Berlin is a culturally-vibrant city offering resident and visitor <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> successful musical about Churchill and Stalin and cosmopolitan cuisines, but under the Reinheitsgebot, the nation's medieval beer-purity law, Japanese beer is illegal for importation to the Reich; American fast food is a rarity, because of the American economic collapse on its World War II defeat, however eateries such as The Greasy Spoon do exist.|$|E

25|$|Lassus {{is one of}} the composers of a style {{known as}} musica reservata—a term which has survived in many {{contemporary}} references, many of them seemingly contradictory. The exact meaning of the term is a matter of fierce debate, though a rough consensus among musicologists is that it involves intensely expressive setting of text and chromaticism, and that it may have referred to music specifically written for connoisseurs. A famous composition by Lassus representative of this style is his series of 12 motets entitled Prophetiae Sibyllarum, in <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> chromatic idiom which anticipates the work of Gesualdo; some of the chord progressions in this piece were not to be heard again until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Knowles attends events {{offered to}} the press, {{paid for by the}} movie studios, {{including}} visits to movie sets and premieres. Questions have sometimes emerged about the resulting impartiality of his articles and reviews. For example, he was flown to the premiere of Godzilla, and gave the movie <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> positive review, while a vast majority of critics disliked the film. Knowles later reversed himself and panned the film after the ensuing outcry. Knowles and his defenders, however, have noted that he has given mixed reviews to movies for which he has been sent to junkets and premieres, and in any case is often out of step with mainstream critics. Knowles also gave a negative review to the film Monkeybone, in which he made a cameo appearance.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} she {{began work on}} Léos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf. The film was beset by {{problems}} and took three years to complete, requiring investment from three producers and funds from the French government. When finally released in 1991, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf was a critical success. Binoche won a European Film Award as well as securing her third César nomination for her performance. In the film Binoche portrays an artist who lives rough on the famous Parisian bridge where she meets another young vagrant (Denis Lavant). This iconic {{part of the city}} becomes the backdrop for <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> passionate love story and some of the most visually arresting images of the city ever created. The paintings featured in the film were Binoche's own work. She also designed the French poster for the film which features an ink drawing of the eponymous lovers locked in embrace. During a break in filming in 1990, Binoche spent five days shooting Mara for Mike Figgis, based on Henry Miller's Quiet Days in Clichy. This 30 minute film was part of HBO's anthology series Women & Men 2. The film became somewhat contentious when, according to Mike Figgis, HBO altered it once he had completed it. The film premiered on HBO in the U.S. on 18 August 1991.|$|E

25|$|Tobin's anti-communism led him {{to attempt}} to {{dismantle}} Local 574, which had led the successful Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. The local (led by Carl Skoglund, Farrell Dobbs and the Dunne Brothers) was avowedly Trotskyist, but had successfully led the union through the general strike. Alarmed at the local leadership's political views, Tobin revoked Local 574's charter {{and set up a}} competing local (Local 500). But after Local 574 secured a jurisdictional agreement in early 1935 from the Minneapolis Central Labor Union, it undertook <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> successful organizing campaign and thrived. The AFL and the Minnesota Federation of Labor were alarmed at the growth of the Trotskyist-led union, and demanded action. In October 1935, the Teamsters international union passed a resolution denying membership to communists. Tobin also agreed to let an AFL organizer attempt to raid Local 574. The AFL and Local 574 engaged in mutual acts of violence. But {{when it became clear that}} Local 574 could not be raided and that the CIO might offer membership to the renegade local, Tobin convinced Local 574 leader Victor Dunne to merge with Local 500. A year later, the newly formed Local 544 had organized 250,000 truckers in the Midwest and formed the Central Conference of Teamsters. But after several of Local 544's leaders left the organization, Tobin trusted the local in 1941 and ejected the remaining Trotskyist leadership. When the CIO offered the ousted leaders a role in the newly formed United Construction Workers Organizing Committee, Tobin used his influence with the federal government to secure a federal indictment of sedition under the Smith Act. Several of the men were convicted (although most were acquitted or had charges dropped), and the local broken.|$|E

500|$|Animation {{historian}} Jerry Beck {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{beginning of the}} film is quite promising, with a garbage can discussing life on the streets with some garbage. This is an example of what Bakshi did best—- using the medium of animation to comment on society. Unfortunately, he doesn't do it enough in this film. There is <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> imaginative fantasy sequence during the climax, when the character named Crazy starts hallucinating during a rooftop shooting spree. This scene almost justifies the whole film. But otherwise, this is a rehash of ideas better explored in Coonskin, Heavy Traffic, and Fritz the Cat." ...|$|E

The film received a standing ovation at its completion from an audience that included Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich. Six days later, Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of Time magazine. The New York Times said: [...] "Thank you very much, Mr. Disney". Variety suggested that [...] " [...] perfect is the illusion, so tender the romance and fantasy, so emotional are certain portions when the acting of the characters strikes a depth comparable to the sincerity of human players, that the film approaches real greatness." ...|$|E

500|$|It was fashionable {{for women}} to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the {{presence}} of assertive, active women. The foreign horse-riding sport of polo from Persia became <b>a</b> <b>wildly</b> popular trend amongst the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed earthenware figurines from the time period portray). The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like [...] "an elaborate edifice above the forehead", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again {{in order to promote}} decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.|$|E

As John Lydon later observed, [...] "Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto." [...] The shop would become a {{focal point of the}} punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious, Marco Pirroni (who became a guitarist, songwriter and record producer), Gene October (who became the singer for the punk band Chelsea), and Mark Stewart, among many others.
