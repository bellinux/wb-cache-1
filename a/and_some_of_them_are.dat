25|$|Both {{anatomic}} and physiologic methods allow {{early detection}} before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. Anatomic methods {{are more expensive}} <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify {{the current state of}} the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.|$|E
25|$|Droughts In the Northeast of Brazil {{droughts}} are {{a cyclical}} phenomenon occurring every 10 to 12years, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> very severe. The region has an annual average rainfall ranging from 400 to 800mm, {{and an average}} water availability per person ranging from 1,320 to 1,781m3 (the world's average was 8,209m3 in 2007). The effects of droughts on the local, mostly poor, population are devastating. Droughts are also frequent in the South, home of most of Brazil’s industry, where the latest drought in 2000 culminated in a national energy crisis. (See Electricity sector in Brazil).|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Indian {{paintings were}} the rock paintings of pre-historic times, the petroglyphs {{as found in}} places like Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, {{but they have not}} survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time.|$|E
25|$|In CKD {{numerous}} uremic toxins {{accumulate in}} the blood. Even when ESKD (largely synonymous with CKD5) is treated with dialysis, the toxin levels {{do not go}} back to normal as dialysis is not that efficient. Similarly, after a kidney transplant, the levels may {{not go back to}} normal as the transplanted kidney may not work 100%. If it does, the creatinine level is often normal. The toxins show various cytotoxic activities in the serum and have different molecular weights, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> bound to other proteins, primarily to albumin. Such toxic protein-bound substances are receiving the attention of scientists who are interested in improving the standard chronic dialysis procedures used today.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{vehicular}} events for the player to participate in, including races and checkpoint rallies. Racing events {{may or may not have}} opponents, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> armed races while others are not. Players have the ability to augment their cars with various items and upgrades they can gain by completing events. Rage also features some role-playing game (RPG) elements, including an inventory system, looting system, and different types of ammo. Players have the option to customize their weapons and vehicles, as well as build a wide assortment of items using collected recipes. Not only can the vehicles be used for racing, but, like all open-world sandbox games, they can be used for traveling from one location to the other with occasional attacks from enemy vehicles. There are also side missions and a number of other minor exploratory elements.|$|E

25|$|The Christianity of Yanbian Koreans has {{a patriarchal}} character; Korean churches are usually led by men, in {{contrast}} to Chinese churches which more often have female leadership. For instance, of the 28 registered churches of Yanji, only three of which are Chinese congregations, all the Korean churches have a male pastor while all the Chinese churches have a female pastor. Also, Yanbian Korean church buildings are stylistically very similar to South Korean churches, with big spires surmounted by large red crosses. Yanbian Korean churches and house churches in China have {{been a matter of}} controversy for the Chinese government because of their links to South Korean churches. Many of the Korean house churches in China receive financial support and pastoral ordinations from South Korean churches, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> effectively branches of South Korean churches.|$|E
25|$|HLA {{types are}} inherited, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} with autoimmune disorders and other diseases. People with certain HLA antigens {{are more likely}} to develop certain autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis, celiac disease, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis, Sjögren syndrome, and narcolepsy. HLA typing has led to some improvement and acceleration in the diagnosis of celiac disease and type 1 diabetes; however, for DQ2 typing to be useful, it requires either high-resolution B1*typing (resolving *02:01 from *02:02), DQA1*typing, or DR serotyping. Current serotyping can resolve, in one step, DQ8. HLA typing in autoimmunity is being increasingly used as a tool in diagnosis. In celiac disease, it is the only effective means of discriminating between first-degree relatives that are at risk from those that are not at risk, prior to the appearance of sometimes-irreversible symptoms such as allergies and secondary autoimmune disease.|$|E
25|$|Sherman and her coauthors {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
