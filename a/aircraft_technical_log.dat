5000|$|In {{spite of}} the vibrations, the {{defective}} engine was fitted to the aircraft, it being argued that the vibration level was below acceptable standards. Before flight to New York the aircraft was checked by mechanic Zdzislaw Yarmonyakom, who found that the engine №1 had a concavity on the turbine blades. This concavity was located in the widest part of the blade - in the lower part. The mechanic wanted to report it, and then looked at the <b>aircraft</b> <b>technical</b> <b>log</b> {{and saw that the}} defect was already marked there, but then the plane was subsequently allowed to fly. As he later explained to investigators, the mechanic decided that the concavity is within tolerance. Engine №3 had 8200 hours operating time without repair. In fact the aircraft SP-LAA Mikolaj Kopernik was allowed to fly to New York with three engines [...] "leaders" [...] and only one №4 was fully serviceable.|$|E
50|$|Between May 2008 and March 2009, nine {{incidents}} {{involving the}} temporary loss of airspeed indication {{appeared in the}} Air Safety Reports (ASRs) for Air France's A330/A340 fleet. All occurred in cruise between flight levels FL310 and FL380. Further, after the Flight 447 accident, Air France identified six additional incidents which had not been reported on ASRs. These were intended for maintenance <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Logs</b> (ATLs) drawn up by the pilots to describe these incidents only partially, to indicate the characteristic symptoms of the incidents associated with unreliable airspeed readings. The problems primarily occurred in 2007 on the A320 but, awaiting a recommendation from Airbus, Air France delayed installing new pitot tubes on A330/A340 and increased inspection frequencies in these planes.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 August 2009, a SATA Internacional Airbus A320-200 {{operating}} flight S4-129 from Lisbon to Ponta Delgada {{bounced off the}} runway then subsequently experienced a severe hard landing of 4.86G, causing damage to the landing gear. Nothing {{was written in the}} <b>aircraft's</b> <b>technical</b> maintenance <b>log,</b> both flight crew and maintenance staff were unable to interpret the hard landing report and despite the damage, the aircraft was not removed from service and flew back to Lisbon in customer service as well as flying an additional 6 sectors. SATA said in a statement [...] that the hard landing/load reports are not a mandatory requirement for the aircraft type and drew attention to the amount of time Airbus took to confirm to them the interpretation of the load report. Both landing gear legs subsequently had to be replaced. In their final report the Portuguese accident investigation authority the Aviation Accidents Prevention and Investigation Department determined that the primary cause of the incident was the ground spoilers deploying in flight after the aircraft had bounced 12 ft off the runway. Contributing factors were the failure of the pilot to go-around after the bounce, the failure of the pilot to release the thrust levers before the first touchdown (which inhibited the ground spoilers deploying) and the pilot providing insufficient flare input. Airbus subsequently introduced a new software standard for the A320 in July 2010 to modify the ground spoiler deployment logic.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} algorithm for functional system reliability influence on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>technical</b> maintenance. The research results which allow to estimate the functional system reliability influence on the aircraft tech- nical maintenance process are provided. The aircraft maintenance process effectiveness implies the maintenance procedures including pre-flight preparation, the flight itself, technical maintenance and storage. The research was aimed at forecasting the <b>aircraft</b> <b>technical</b> maintenance process considering the functional system reliability, with special attention payed to failure-free operation. The term failure-free operation stands for the ability to execute a required function within a given time interval at given conditions. The objects of maintenance -aircraft functional systems and their components have a great degree of failure-free operation, {{which has been a}} design requirement and is supported at aircraft maintenance and operation. Failures and mal- functions are seldom events. This fact leads to a limited statistic maintenance surveillance database. Classical methods of statistical analyses do not provide the sufficient fiducial probability for functional system failure-free operation estimation. Thus these methods do not allow to estimate its influence on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>technical</b> maintenance process effectiveness. In order to solve this problem it is suggested to use the method of flow diagrams and random sample statistical method for failure-free operation estimation-statistical modeling (Monte-Carlo Method). Reliability flow diagram method allowed to determine the functional system failure-free operation random sample dependence on the technical maintenance frequency. The initial data were: the functional system flow diagram, the list of the main equipment, functional system equipment failure random sample data. The use of statistical modeling allowed to estimate the dependence of functional system reliability (failure-free operation) on the technical maintenance frequency for expanded statistical database (a num- ber of functional system maintenance and operation procedures) ...|$|R
