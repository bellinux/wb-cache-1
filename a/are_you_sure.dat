500|$|Later on, {{the protagonist}} {{encounters}} a hostile and unstable female apparition, presumably named Lisa, and {{upon entering the}} bathroom and being locked, he obtains a flashlight and finds a creature resembling an underdeveloped fetus crying in the sink. He soon gets out, but finds out that the apparition is watching him. If the protagonist is attacked by the ghost, he reawakens in the first room of the game, beginning the loop again, but it's possible to avoid her completely. In the room, a bloody moving paper bag speaks to him, speaking of a disturbing experience, and stating the same quote seen {{at the start of}} the game - [...] "Watch out. The gap in the door... it's a separate reality. The only me is me. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> the only you is you?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the Emperor tells Virgil of the {{disastrous}} end to several similar matches {{he has seen}} in his long life, and makes him an offer: He will endorse the gramophone—which will lead to enormous sales and profits for Virgil—only if he breaks up with Johanna. Virgil refuses, highly insulted, but the Emperor asks him one more question: <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you will be enough for her? ...|$|E

"You said on that occasion," [...] {{continued}} Furnival, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> {{had witnessed}} three signatures of Sir Joseph's that summer,--that you had probably witnessed three in July, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> had witnessed three {{in one week}} in July, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> nearly <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> had witnessed three in one day, {{that you could not}} tell what day that might have <b>been,</b> and that <b>you</b> had <b>been</b> used as a witness so often that you really did not remember anything about it.

2500|$|Incorporating {{words from}} foreign {{languages}} into Cantonese is also acceptable by most Cantonese speakers. Hong Kong Cantonese speakers frequently code-mix although they can distinguish foreign words from Cantonese ones. For instance, [...] "噉都唔 make sense", literally means [...] "it doesn't make sense". After a Cantonese speaker decides to code-mix a foreign {{word in a}} Cantonese sentence, syntactical rules of Cantonese will be followed. For instance, [...] "sure" [...] (肯定) can be used like [...] "你 su1 唔 su1 aa3?" [...] (<b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure?)</b> {{as if it were}} its Cantonese counterpart [...] "你肯唔肯定?", using the A-not-A question construction.|$|E
2500|$|Arbuckle tried {{returning}} to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his pictures continued to linger after his acquittal. He retreated into alcoholism. In {{the words of}} his first wife, [...] "Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle". Buster Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by giving him work on his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short called Daydreams (1922). Arbuckle allegedly co-directed scenes in Keaton's Sherlock, Jr. (1924), but {{it is unclear how}} much of this footage remained in the film's final cut. In 1925, Carter Dehaven made the short Character Studies. Arbuckle appeared alongside Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, and Jackie Coogan. The same year, in Photoplays August issue, James R. Quirk wrote [...] "I would like to see Roscoe Arbuckle make a comeback to the screen." [...] He also said [...] "The American nation prides itself upon its spirit of fair play. We like the whole world to look upon America as the place where every man gets a square deal. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> Roscoe Arbuckle is getting one today? I'm not." ...|$|E
2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know.

My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> you want to do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E
