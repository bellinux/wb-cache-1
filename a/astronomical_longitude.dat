50|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) {{receivers}} {{show that}} the marking strip for the prime meridian at Greenwich is not exactly at zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds but at approximately 5.3 seconds of arc {{to the west of}} the meridian (meaning that the meridian appears to be 102 metres east of this line). In the past, this offset has been attributed to the establishment of reference meridians for space-based location systems such as WGS 84 (which GPS relies on) or that errors gradually crept into the International Time Bureau timekeeping process. The actual reason for the discrepancy is that the marking strip is indeed at <b>astronomical</b> <b>longitude</b> zero degrees, zero minutes, and zero seconds—but GPS receivers show geodetic longitude (specifically ITRF/WGS 84).|$|E
50|$|If the Earth were {{perfectly}} spherical and homogeneous, then the longitude {{at a point}} would be equal to the angle between a vertical north-south plane through that point and {{the plane of the}} Greenwich meridian. Everywhere on Earth the vertical north-south plane would contain the Earth's axis. But the Earth is not homogeneous, and has mountains—which have gravity and so can shift the vertical plane away from the Earth's axis. The vertical north-south plane still intersects the plane of the Greenwich meridian at some angle; that angle is the <b>astronomical</b> <b>longitude,</b> calculated from star observations. The longitude shown on maps and GPS devices is the angle between the Greenwich plane and a not-quite-vertical plane through the point; the not-quite-vertical plane is perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} spheroid chosen to approximate the Earth's sea-level surface, rather than perpendicular to the sea-level surface itself.|$|E
5000|$|When the Airy transit circle was built, a mercury basin {{was used}} to align the {{telescope}} to the perpendicular. Thus the circle was aligned with the local vertical or plumb line, which is deflected slightly from the normal, or line perpendicular, to the reference ellipsoid used to define geodetic latitude and longitude in the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (which is nearly {{the same as the}} WGS-84 system used by GPS). While the local vertical defined at the Airy transit circle still points to the modern celestial meridian (the intersection of the prime meridian plane with the celestial sphere), it does not pass through the Earth's rotation axis. As a result of this, the ITRF zero meridian, defined by a plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis, is 102 metres to the east of the prime meridian. A 2015 analysis by Malys et al. shows the offset between the Airy transit circle and the ITRF/WGS 84 meridians can be explained by this deflection of the vertical alone; other possible sources of the offset that have been proposed in the past are smaller than the current uncertainty in the deflection of the vertical near the observatory. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>longitude</b> of the Greenwich prime meridian was found to be 0.19&Prime; ± 0.47&Prime; East, i.e. the plane defined by the local vertical on the Greenwich prime meridian and the plane passing through the Earth's rotation axis on the ITRF zero meridian are effectively parallel. However, the claim, found, e.g., in a BBC article that this difference between astronomical and geodetic coordinates means that any measurements of transit time across the IRTF zero meridian will occur 0.352 seconds (or 0.353 sidereal seconds) before the transit across the [...] "intended meridian" [...] is based on a failure of understanding. The explanation by Malys et al. on the other hand is both lucid and correct.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{observations}} from a ground-based astrometric instrument provide a {{unique set of}} data sensitive to variations of local plumb line, which represent the change of local gravitational field on the ground. The local gravitational change could be caused by density variation or movement of underground mass in addition to tidal action. Earthquake was found to be related with gravitational change. A seismic zone could have abnormal underground material density, causing the variation of plume line on the ground. In this frame, the astrometric telescope can measure the variation of local plumb line by observing the local <b>astronomical</b> <b>longitudes</b> and latitudes from stars in the Hipparcos catalog. In this study, we estimate the deflection angle of the plumb line on a ground site, and give a relation between the angle, abnormal mass and site distance (depth and horizontal distance). Then we derive the abnormality of underground material density using the plumb lines measured at different sites, and study the earthquake gestation, development and occurrence. Using the deflection angles of plumb lines observed at two sites, we give a method to calculate the mass and the center of gravity of underground materials. We also estimate the abnormal masses of latent seismic zones with different energy, using thermodynamic relations, and introduce a new optical astrometric instrument we had developed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe “Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris” was {{published}} from 1767 by Nevil Maskelyne via the Board of longitude, the commission instituted in 1714 by Queen Ann {{to solve the}} longitude problem on sea. The Almanac is an annually published ephemeris giving the positions of heavenly bodies for stated points in time and has provided essential data to navigators, geographers and astronomers. The tables also contained everything essential for a “general use” and its users had practically to be skilled on mathematical and even technical knowledge. This talk will consider the Almanac in relation with the Board of longitude and the strategies developed by Maskelyne to diffuse <b>astronomical</b> method in <b>longitude</b> computation.

40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{development}} of a system for fast and accurate determination of <b>astronomical</b> latitude (alpha), <b>longitude</b> (Lambda) and azimuth (A). The system consists of a high-precision total station, with the appropriate software for automatic registration of the measured elements, connected to a GPS receiver through which accurate UTC timing is provided. This system allows the acquisition of a large amount of data during the tracking of selected stars around their meridian transit. After the appropriate processing of the data, an accuracy of sigma(Phi) =sigma(A) =+/- 0 ". 01, sigma(A) =+/- 0 ". 2 may be achieved for the determination of the astronomical coordinates and azimuth. The developed system compares favourably to older classical ones, due to its compactness and the accuracy obtained within a short period of time. Thus, combined with GPS receivers for the geodetic coordinates determination, it can easily be used for the determination of the deviation of the vertical and eventually of the geoid separation N...|$|R
5000|$|Andrés de San Martín, {{according}} to Tim Joyner, {{was the most}} eminent cosmographer in the fleet, unequaled by {{no one in the}} fleet, not even by the greatest mariner of all time, Ferdinand Magellan. Twice, he was able to calculate accurately, using <b>astronomical</b> measurement, the <b>longitudes</b> of two places, Port San Julian at Patagonia and Homonhon Island in the Philippines. At San Julian, he brought out his instruments, to quote Tim Joyner, [...] "to test Faleiro's (Ruy) Failero system for using conjunctions of the moon with the planets to determine longitude. His measurements resulted in the astonishingly accurate estimate of 61° west of Seville. Less than one degree in error, this was an accomplishment far beyond the capabilities of the other pilots." [...] Again, at Homonhon Island, in central Philippines, he was able to measure its longitude, {{according to}} Rolando A. Laguardia Trias. Trias asserts that the reading of 189° longitude [...] "from the meridian" [...] which meant the line of demarcation at 47° west of Greenwich. In today's system of reckoning Homonhon Is. is at 125° 42.8' east longitude.|$|R
50|$|The ancient Greeks had {{discovered}} that a dark stone metal could attract or repel objects of iron. Was {{the origin of the}} study of magnetism. At the time of the great sailing, the navigators could not find a ship at sea by the two coordinates, latitude and longitude, the determination of this required a clock on board to indicate the exact time at the meridian of reference, and the <b>astronomical</b> determination of <b>longitude</b> gave unacceptable errors. During the trip to India, D. João de Castro has carried out a series of experiments that succeeded in detecting the phenomena, in particular related to magnetism and the magnetic needle on board. It should be assumed that such knowledge comes from Pedro Nunes, of course the direct inspiration of all the observations he has done in his travels. When on 5 August 1538, D. João de Castro decided to determine the latitude of Mozambique, found the cause that dictated the astonishing uneasiness of needles; noted the deviation of the needle, discovering it 128 years before Guillaume Dennis (1666) of Nieppe, which is recorded in history of sailing {{as if he were the}} first to know about this phenomenon. His observation near Baçaim, on 22 December 1538, of a magnetic phenomenon, for which there were variations of the needle because of the proximity of certain rocks, confirmed four centuries later, called local attraction. D. João de Castro refuted the theory that the variation of magnetic declination is not formed by geographic meridians.|$|R
