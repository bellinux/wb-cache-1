From this location Lowe repeatedly launched his balloon, Intrepid, to track Confederate troop movements along the Occoquan River, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>he</b> saw the earliest successes of his short-lived Federal Balloon Corps. The church was used as a stable by Union forces during the winter of 1862–63, during which time the interior was stripped of everything save the upper cornice.

500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him.

AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commended Timberlake's [...] "clear musical vision" [...] and stated, [...] "Graceless he may be, [...] is nevertheless kind of fascinating on FutureSex/LoveSounds". Q called it a [...] "set of forward-thinking pop reminiscent of" [...] Prince's 1987 album Sign [...] "O" [...] the Times. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times stated, [...] "How well do Mr. Timberlake and Timbaland work together? So well that they can make even the world's most irritating percussion instrument, the human beatbox, sound pretty good."
