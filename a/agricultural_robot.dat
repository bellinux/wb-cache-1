The complete automation of the milking process {{is controlled by}} an <b>agricultural</b> <b>robot,</b> a complex herd management software, and specialized computers. Automatic milking eliminates the farmer from the actual milking process, allowing for more time for supervision of the farm and the herd. Farmers can also improve herd management by using the data gathered by the computer. By analyzing the effect of various animal feeds on milk yield, farmers may adjust accordingly to obtain optimal milk yields. Since the data is available down to individual level, each cow may be tracked and examined, and the farmer may be alerted when there are unusual changes that could mean sickness or injuries.|$|E

As crab steering is wanted on NMBU Mobile <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Robot,</b> a short discus- sion of the kinematics is presented. Ackerman geometry is introduced, and four wheel Ackerman equations are derived. Curvature and turning radius {{is used in the}} kinematic equations, and a singularity condition is both identi ed and taken care of. Kinematic equa- tions are developed further for unambiguous steering angles in all wheel po- sitions and separate equations for all four wheels are presented. A map from signed turning radius to inner and outer side is also found, and this gives us unique kinematic equations. Input like signed turning radius and desired speed in center of robot, outputs correct positions and velocity of all actuated joints. Numerical singularity threshold in singularity workaround are discussed and found. A map from steering angles to number of motor turns is found, as well as a map from ground speed in center of robot to RPM in propulsion motors. An intuitive example where the robot follows a simple path is in- cluded.

40|$|Mobile <b>robots</b> {{operating}} in <b>agricultural</b> environments {{have been a}} significant subject for researchers. The rapid advancement in communication, sensors and computing technologies has provided important progress {{in the field of}} <b>agricultural</b> autonomous <b>robot</b> guidance systems. Automated <b>agricultural</b> <b>robots</b> save labour costs, prevent people from performing risky operations, and provide the farmer with up-to-date and precise information to assist management decisions. The research on mobile robot navigation systems in agricultural environments consists of designing suitable systems for sensing, mapping, localisation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance. The navigation algorithm must use sensory information to determine a suitable trajectory, make a decision, and move correctly within its environment without collision. In this paper, an overview of navigation systems for autonomous agricultural vehicles is presented and discussed. The key elements are navigational sensors, computational techniques, and navigation control strategies. The selection, coordination, and combination of the optimal sensors to provide the basic information for mobile robot navigation are critical processes. Powerful algorithms are used for feature extraction, data processing and fusion. For autonomous navigation, steering controllers provide an appropriate steering action to automatically drive vehicles. Navigation of mobile robots in outdoor environments such as agricultural applications is still an open problem. The design of efficient and robust sensing and control systems for <b>agricultural</b> mobile <b>robots</b> is required to overcome the difficulties due to the weather conditions, dynamic environments, unexpected obstacles, terrain nature variations and vegetation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of Active Contours in tracking is {{highly dependent on}} the availability of an appropriate model of shape and motion, to use as a predictor. Models can be hand-built, but it is far more e ective and less time-consuming to learn them from a training set. Techniques to do this exist both for shape, and for shape and motion jointly. This paper extends the range of shape and motion models in two significant ways. The rst is to model jointly the random variations in shape arising within an object-class and those occuring during object motion. The resulting algorithm is applied to tracking of plants captured by a video camera mounted on an <b>agricultural</b> <b>robot.</b> The second addresses the tracking of coupled objects such as head and lips. In both cases, new algorithms are shown to make important contributions to tracking performance. ...|$|E

The output of the fuzzy system is a multiplier which represents the degree of uncertainty of the landmark. High values of uncertainty results in landmarks being discarded, average values results in revaluation, and smaller values result in acceptance with the error covariance being a product of the multiplier and the measured covariance. Selected landmarks with corresponding error covariance are used to update the Kalman Filter.
