5|$|After the 1917 October Revolution, {{the chaotic}} retreat of Russian troops from Western Armenia escalated.

The Soviet Russian {{government}} formally <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> right of self-determination of the Ottoman Armenians in January 1918, but on 3 March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers, ceding Western Armenia and large areas in Eastern Europe to concentrate its forces against the Whites in the Russian Civil War.|$|E

The Spanish government in the Canary Islands prevented a Ukrainian freighter from delivering 636tons of military equipment to Angola on 24 February 2001. The captain of the ship had inaccurately reported his cargo, falsely claiming the ship carried automobile parts. The Angolan government admitted Simportex had purchased arms from Rosvooruzhenie, the Russian state-owned arms company, and <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> captain might have violated Spanish law by misreporting his cargo, a common practice in arms smuggling to Angola.|$|E

5|$|Constance of Hauteville (1128–1163) was {{the ruling}} Princess of Antioch from 1130 to 1163. She {{was the only}} child of Bohemond II of Antioch by his wife, Alice of Jerusalem. Constance succeeded her father, who fell in battle, at the age of two, {{although}} his cousin, Roger II of Sicily, laid claim to Antioch. Her mother assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance's grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After he died in 1131, Alice again tried {{to take control of the}} government, but the Antiochene barons <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> right of her brother-in-law, Fulk of Anjou, to rule as regent for Constance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over {{defining}} URLs and URNs it became evident that the two concepts embodied by the terms were merely aspects of the fundamental, overarching notion of resource identification. In June 1994, the IETF published Berners-Lee's RFC 1630: the first Request for Comments that <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> existence of URLs and URNs, and, more importantly, defined a formal syntax for Universal Resource Identifiers— URL-like strings whose precise syntaxes and semantics depended on their schemes. In addition, this RFC attempted to summarize the syntaxes of URL schemes in use at the time. It also acknowledged, but did not standardize, the existence of relative URLs and fragment identifiers.|$|E
5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able to draft a table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium. The Chemical Society only <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E

But when the Colorado legislature <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional.

5|$|In 1527 King Henry VIII asked Pope Clement VII to annul his {{marriage}} to Katherine of Aragon, but the pope refused. This started {{a series of events}} known as English Reformation in which Henry broke away from the authority of the pope. In lieu of the pope, Henry assumed authority over the church: all priests and religious figures, including monks, were required to swear support to the royal supremacy over the church. Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey <b>acknowledged</b> <b>the</b> king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E
