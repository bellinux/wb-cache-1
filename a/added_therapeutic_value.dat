40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the availability of}} information about premarketing randomized active-control trials (RaCTs) involving medicines with a new active substance {{at the moment of}} market authorization in the European Union. METHODS: Information was obtained from the EMEA European Public Assessment Reports and the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2005, 48 % of recently approved medicines (n = 122) had been studied in comparison with existing medicines at the moment of market authorization. About one-third of these trials were published and publicly available at that moment. CONCLUSIONS: For most new medicines evidence-based assessment of the (<b>added)</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> is not really possible at the moment of market authorization...|$|E
40|$|Innovation in the {{development}} of new drugs has to balance the needs of health actors and administrators, the pharmaceutical industry and patients. Differing perspectives on what constitutes an innovation, where research and development should be directed and how new drugs should be evaluated and priced cause ongoing tensions within the regulatory framework. In the current climate, where Europe’s health systems face rising demand for health services and increasingly restricted resources, the efficiency of pharmaceutical regulation and drug development is under even greater scrutiny. How can regulation foster innovation and industry growth while also serving the public health needs of society, and what is the EU’s role in pursuing this objective? Drawing on a provision which formerly existed in Norwegian pharmaceutical legislation, this article explores the potential of a medical need clause (MNC) in addressing these issues. In restricting market authorisations to those drugs that offer an <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value,</b> might a MNC foster innovation and spending efficiency in Europe’s health systems...|$|E
40|$|Beyond the white-coat; {{the fall}} and rise of placebo effects in new types of medical visits. Within general practice, a doctor-patient contact can vary between a vis-à-vis contact and a more {{recently}} fashionable Internet contact. In between these two extremes, other types of contact are possible as well. It is questionable whether these different types of contacts are equally effective {{in terms of the}} generally acknowledged <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of non-specific or placebo factors within the medical visit, such as anxiety reduction, conditioning effects and the influence of positive expectations. After giving an overview of the most relevant placebo components and its underlying mechanisms, the placebo effect of different types of doctor-patient contacts is being explored. This exploration warrants the conclusion that apart from the absence of non-verbal communication, the placebo effect of Internet contacts will gradually catch up with that of vis-à-vis contacts as soon as these new types of contact have shown to be effective as well.

40|$|Background: High-risk {{medical devices}} {{may not always}} provide a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> to patients. In Europe, no proof of {{efficacy}} is required to receive a CE label, {{making it difficult for}} policymakers to decide on reimbursement of (often expensive) high-risk medical devices. We explore, {{within the framework of the}} European legislation, the possibilities at a national level for a guided introduction of such devices. Research design and Methods: HTA and legal experts worked in close collaboration with medical specialists and government representatives making a legal analysis of what is possible under the (revised) European and national legislation. Results: At national level, measures for a better evidence-based introduction can be taken that are not in contradiction with the European regulation. From a legal point of view, all restrictive measures must be justified, necessary and proportional. Several measures are possible, a. o. making use of reference centres, applying the IDEAL framework or the 6 -step plan set up by the Dutch Order of Medical Specialists. Conclusions: Within the framework of the (revised) European legislation, measures at national level can be taken to temporarily restrict and follow up the use of high-risk medical devices with a greater focus on the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> for the patients.

40|$|Our Hospital is a non-referral {{hospital}} without NICU facili-ties. Neonates {{meeting the}} criteria for therapeutic hypothermia need to be transported to a NICU. The diagnostic value of aEEG monitoring in a non-NICU setting is unknown. We hypothesised aEEG monitoring in a non-NICU setting adds value to diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in asphyxiated neonates. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on all asphyxi-ated neonates born from January 2011 untill July 2013 in our hospital. Asphyxia was defined as Apgar score ≤ 5 after 5 min or rescusitation or ventilation from birth for 10 min or pH 16 mmol/L or lactic acid> 10. 0 mmol/L. Results We evaluated 57 asphyxiated neonates of which 12 neo-nates were directly intubated and transported to NICU. In 7 out of 45 (15, 5 %) asphyxiated neonates the performed aEEG had diagnostic consequences. Finally, 4 out of 7 neonates (9 %) were treated for subclinical seizures (n = 3) or therapeutic hypother-mia (n = 1).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe European Transparency Directive {{requires}} that reimbursement decisions of member states are {{taken in a}} transparent, objective, and verifiable way within strict timelines. We investigated whether evidence of therapeutic value was a factor affecting the Belgian pharmaceutical reimbursement decision without compromising the respect of strict timelines. MethodsWe analyzed 824 reimbursement submissions within the period 2002 to 2004. ResultsOnly 67 submissions claimed <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> versus available alternatives: if the applicant failed to prove added value the odds ratio (OR) for a negative decision increased significantly: OR = 9. 1 (2. 3 – 35. 6). There were 399 “limited evidence” submissions (new medicinal products or new indications) and 425 “extended evidence” submissions (mainly line extensions). The OR for a negative decision decreased significantly for submissions with extended evidence: OR = 0. 18 (0. 12 – 0. 27). The median time to decision was 175 days. ConclusionsBoth factors suggest that evidence {{plays a role in}} the decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|Until 1994, {{pharmaceutical}} products seeking market authorisation in Norway {{were required to}} demonstrate a fulfilment of unmet medical need. This clause enabled the national regulator to dramatically {{limit the number of}} products on the market whilst encouraging price competition to keep drug expenditure low and was credited with encouraging the development of drugs with genuine <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> and reducing the incidence of antimicrobial resistance. Norway was forced to abandon its Medical Need Clause (MNC) when it joined the European Economic Area as it was incompatible with the acquis communautaire of the European Union. This article reviews Norway's experience with its MNC in light of contemporary debates in European health policy. It discusses the potential contribution of an MNC-style regulation to improving health, reducing illness, ensuring sustainable health systems and fostering pharmaceutical innovation. It concludes by asking how these findings can inform current European Union debates over the growing cost of prescription drugs and direction of pharmaceutical development...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} pharmaceutical {{pricing and}} reimbursement policies in European countries {{with regard to}} their ability to ensure affordable access to medicines. A frequently applied pricing policy is external price referencing. While it provides some benchmark for policy-makers and {{has been shown to be}} able to generate savings, it may also contribute to delay in product launch in countries where medicine prices are low. Value-based pricing has been proposed as a policy that promotes access while rewarding useful innovation; however, implementing it has proven quite challenging. For high-priced medicines, managed-entry agreements are increasingly used. These agreements allow policy-makers to manage uncertainty and obtain lower prices. They can also facilitate earlier market access in case of limited evidence about <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> of the medicine. However, these agreements raise transparency concerns due to the confidentiality clause. Tendering as used in the hospital and offpatent outpatient sectors has been proven to reduce medicine prices but it requires a robust framework and appropriate design with clear strategic goals in order to prevent shortages. These pricing and reimbursement policies are supplemented by the widespread use of Health Technology Assessment to inform decision-making, and by strategies to improve the uptake of generics, and also biosimilars. While European countries have been implementing a set of policy options, there is a lack of thorough impact assessments of several pricing and reimbursement policies on affordable access. Increased cooperation between authorities, experience sharing and improving transparency on price information, including the disclosure of confidential discounts, are opportunities to address current challenges...|$|E
40|$|Background:Background: In the Netherlands, {{decisions}} about the reimbursement of new pharmaceuticals are based on cost effectiveness, as well as <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> and budget impact. Since 1 January 2005, drug manufacturers are formally required to substantiate the cost effectiveness of drugs that have <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> in comparison with existing ones through pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Dutch guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research provide methods guidance, ensuring consistency in both the evidence and the decision-making process about drug reimbursement. Abstract: Aim:Aim: This study reviewed the methodological quality of all 21 formally required pharmacoeconomic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals between 1 January 2005 and 1 October 2008, and verified whether these evaluations complied with pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Abstract: Methods:Methods: Data {{on the quality of}} the pharmacoeconomic evaluations were extracted from the pharmacoeconomic reports published by the Dutch Health Care Insurance Board (CVZ). The Board's newsletters provided information on the advice to, and reimbursement decisions made by, the Dutch Minister of Health. All data extraction was carried out by two independent reviewers, and descriptive analyses were conducted. Abstract: Results:Results: The methodological quality was sound in only 8 of the 21 pharmacoeconomic evaluations. In most cases, the perspective of analysis, the comparator drugs, and the reporting of both total and incremental costs and effects were correct. However, drug indication, form (i. e. cost utility/cost effectiveness) and time horizon of the evaluations were frequently flawed. Moreover, the costs and effects of the pharmaceuticals were not always analysed correctly, and modelling studies were often non-transparent. Twelve drugs were reimbursed, and nine were not. Abstract: Conclusions:Conclusions: The compliance with pharmacoeconomic guidelines in economic evaluations of new pharmaceuticals can be improved. This would improve the methodological quality of the pharmacoeconomic evaluations and ensure consistency in the evidence and the decision-making process for drug reimbursement in the Netherlands.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} interactions between the various agents in the pharmaceutical industry {{and how they are}} affected by changes in health care policy. In my work, I examine innovation and competition among new brand drugs and the value of prescription drug insurance after patent expiration. The second chapter of my dissertation empirically assesses the trade-off between patent breadth and patent length, a topic that has attracted significant theoretical but little empirical attention. I estimate a model of pharmaceutical demand and supply that incorporates insurance and advertising for the antidepressant market. Using these estimates, I consider the potential welfare effects of giving {{some of the most important}} product innovations broader but shorter patents, which increases the market power that these innovators have in the short-run but also allows for more rapid entry by generics. My results indicate that in this setting broader patents could increase total welfare by more than 9 %, mostly through savings in insurer expenditures. These results are robust to endogenizing the entry of other branded drugs. In the third chapter, which stems from research done jointly with Peter Arcidiacono, Paul Ellickson, and David Ridley, I use data from the pharmaceutical industry to estimate demand and supply for prescription drugs across both insured and uninsured consumers, allowing for consumer preferences organized into discrete types. I account for an important characteristic of health care markets: the price paid by insured consumers (copayment) is typically much smaller than the price received by the manufacturer. This analysis highlights how generic-drug availability differentially affects insured and uninsured consumers. In particular, generic entry disproportionately benefits insured consumers, at least in the first year to two years. The fourth chapter in my dissertation extends the analysis in Chapter 2 to allow for a more generalized framework. In Chapter 2, the first pharmaceutical product innovation that enters a therapeutic class is assumed to be high-value while those innovations that follow are assumed to provide relatively little, if any, <b>added</b> <b>therapeutic</b> <b>value</b> beyond the first. Using the same data and demand model estimates, I consider the potential welfare effects of allowing these later to be considered high-value products and providing them with greater patent breadth and shorter patent length. My results indicate that in this setting, the modified patent policy could still increase total welfare by more than 8 %, mostly through savings in insurer expenditures. These results are also robust to endogenizing the entry of other branded products. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|AbstractInnovation is {{constantly}} evoked as an imperative to drive growth, however identifying an actionable and agreed upon definition {{that applies to}} different settings and purposes is not trivial. In healthcare, innovation has often been described in relation to pharmaceuticals. Defining innovation allows for proper recognition and rewarding, thus fostering present and future innovativeness in the system. Current definitions adopted by payers are focused on <b>therapeutic</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> and more specifically include clinically significant benefit, large health gains, and favorable risk-benefit balance at an acceptable cost. However, {{they may not be}} fully adequate to assess medical devices. Based on a systematic review of the academic literature in the field, we aim at summarizing acceptable definitions of innovation in relation to medical devices. Based on the innovation management and economics theory, proposed definitions have been classified according to the source of innovation, to the degree of discontinuity introduced and to the impact associated to the technology. They have also been compared with definitions adopted for drugs by main healthcare reimbursement agencies. Decision-making in healthcare often favors static allocative efficiency at the expense of incentives to innovate and obtaining valuable innovation, that is dynamic allocative efficiency. In the long run, this attitude may artificially shrink net returns from innovation and rebound on the sustainability of the healthcare systems, an undesirable consequence that a farsighted shared notion of innovation should try to prevent...|$|R
