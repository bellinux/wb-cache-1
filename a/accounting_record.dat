5000|$|A plug, {{also known}} as {{reconciling}} amount, is an unsupported adjustment to an <b>accounting</b> <b>record</b> or general ledger. [...] Ideally, bookkeeping should account for all numbers during reconciliation, i.e. when comparing two sets of accounting records {{to make sure they}} are in agreement. However, discrepancies, i.e. unintentional accounting errors can occur, for example due to data entry, or an adding or a rounding error. An organization may use a plug for an immaterial amount, because it may not be cost effective to search through numerous pages of transactions to find the error. The acceptability of a plug depends upon the amount: a plug must be immaterial in order to be justified.|$|E

In line with the {{objectives}} of this study, a descriptive design such as personal interviews and questionnaire were employed as the major techniques for primary data collection. Data collected were analyzed using both the qualitative and quantitative methods. The descriptive statistics used were tables and percentages. Chi- square and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were employed to analyze data through STATA 10 version with the coefficient of determination (R 2) 0. 8974 which implied that 89. 7 % {{of the variation in}} financial performance could be explained by the level of <b>accounting</b> <b>records</b> keeping.

50|$|Costs {{of company}} {{registration}} {{are also very}} high {{making it difficult for}} certain small businesses to public float. Along with higher costs processes of registering and running a company are also very complex. For example, in UK in order to run a public limited company all details musts be provided like who are board of directors, share holders, result of share holder votes and debentures. Along with this a comprehensive <b>accounting</b> <b>record</b> is also needed like sales and whom they are made to (until and unless it is a retail business), Purchases and from whom they are done stock and debts all of them are necessary to be provided. Along with all these costs a huge amount of taxes are also to be paid while a company is public floating. For instance in the UK a company has to pay corporation tax which is 20% if the profit per year is £300,000 or less and 21% if profit is above £300,000.|$|E

An adab (or hymn) to Nergal was composed in honor of Šu-ilišu, together with an adab of An and perhaps a 3rd addressed to himself. The archive of a craft workshop (or giš-kin-ti) from the city-state Isin has been uncovered with 920 texts dating from Išbi-Erra year 4 through to Šu-ilišu year 3 — a period of 33 years. The tablets are records of receipts and disbursements of the: leather goods, furniture, baskets, mats, and felt goods that were manufactured along with their raw materials.

5000|$|Without {{answering}} the question it asked itself, the panel majority concluded that the claims in this case were closer to those in cases upholding validity under § 101 than those in cases denying validity. The court then decided to bypass the Alice step one (is the claim directed to an abstract idea) and go directly to step two (is there an inventive concept added to the abstract idea). It concluded: [...] "Indeed, {{even if we were}} to agree that claim 1 is directed to an ineligible abstract idea under step one, the claim is eligible under step two because it contains a sufficient 'inventive concept,' it requires 'computer code for using the accounting information with which the first network <b>accounting</b> <b>record</b> is correlated to enhance the first network accounting record.'&#8202;" [...] The court reached this conclusion because it had construed the term [...] "enhance" [...] in the claims as meaning [...] "being dependent upon the invention's distributed architecture," [...] or as meaning [...] "to apply a number of field enhancements in a distributed fashion." [...] The concept of distribution meant that [...] "the network usage records are processed close to their sources before being transmitted to a centralized manager," [...] which makes the database system work faster and more efficiently. The panel majority found that way to improve functionality to be an [...] "inventive concept." [...] According to the patent specification [...] "this distributed enhancement was a critical advancement over the prior art." ...|$|E
