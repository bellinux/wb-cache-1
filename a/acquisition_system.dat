5|$|The AH-64D Apache Longbow is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit and advanced sensors, the most noticeable of which being the AN/APG-78 Longbow millimeter-wave fire-control radar (FCR) target <b>acquisition</b> <b>system</b> and the Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), housed in a dome located above the main rotor. The radome's raised position enables target detection while the helicopter is behind obstacles (e.g. terrain, trees or buildings). The AN/APG-78 is capable of simultaneously tracking up to 128 targets and engaging up to 16 at once, an attack can be initiated within 30 seconds. A radio modem integrated with the sensor suite allows data to be shared with ground units and other Apaches; allowing them to fire on targets detected by a single helicopter.|$|E

Current <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> learn from users in a passive manner, and could instead be designed to incorporate the proactive capabilities that one expects of a good student. We first describe our analysis {{of the literature on}} teacher-student interaction and present a compilation of tutoring and learning principles that are relevant to interactive knowledge <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems.</b> We then point out what tutoring and learning principles have been used to date in the acquisition literature, though unintentionally and implicitly, and discuss how a more thorough and explicit representation of these principles would help improve how computers learn from users.

25|$|An {{advantage}} of DFAT testing over reverberant testing is the portability of the DFAT system. This allows {{the test equipment}} to be transported to any location, setup, calibrated, used to perform a High Intensity Acoustic Test and then removed from the test site. The entire process from load-in to load-out can be accomplished in no more than 4 days for a large satellite or similar aerospace structure. The test system uses a “building block” approach to form combinations of equipment to satisfy the environmental requirements. Systems typically include 500 plus speakers, 2 million plus watts of amplification, at least 8 to 16 control microphones, and a closed-loop MIMO acoustic control and data <b>acquisition</b> <b>system.</b> The mobility and “building block” approach allows this method to be tailored for each application {{and to provide a}} more timely and cost effective test solution. This method can also be useful for testing articles that are too large to fit inside a traditional acoustic reverberant chamber.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{performance}} characteristics high-performance fabrics like Infiniband or OmniPath are interesting technologies for many local area network applications, including data <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> for high-energy physics experiments like the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This paper analyzes existing APIs for high-performance fabrics and evaluates their suitability for data <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of performance and domain applicability. The study finds that existing software APIs for high-performance interconnects are focused on applications in high-performance computing with specific workloads and are not compatible {{with the requirements of}} data <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems.</b> To evaluate the use of high-performance interconnects in data <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems</b> a custom library, NetIO, is presented and compared against existing technologies.

The architecture of NetIO is based on a interchangeable back-end system with which different interconnects can be supported. A libfabric-based back-end supports a wide range of fabric technologies including Infiniband. On the front-end side NetIO supports several high-level communication patterns that are found in typical data acquisition applications like client/server and publish/subscribe. Unlike other frameworks NetIO distinguishes between high-throughput and low-latency communication, which is essential for applications with heterogeneous traffic patterns like data <b>acquisition</b> <b>systems.</b> Benchmarks of NetIO in comparison with the message queue implementation ZeroMQ are presented.
