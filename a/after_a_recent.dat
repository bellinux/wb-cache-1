5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic light that had been {{malfunctioning}} <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown that HIT is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E

25|$|The corners on this {{rear part}} of the {{building}} are rounded, a somewhat unusual condition for corners in buildings of this type of architecture. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> remodeling, most windows and doors were finished in near-duplicative (usually louvered casement) designs. The new annex on the side features arched openings to the street and has glass fenestration. This addition does not contribute to the property's architectural value but due to its disposition and volume it does not harm the main structure's integrity. Even with the 1928 alterations this building is still a magnificent example of Spanish architecture in Ponce and of the neoclassical style.|$|E
25|$|Court was {{formerly}} the only {{body in the}} University which could approve changes to the Charter and Statutes (before they were petitioned to the Privy Council). Thus, Council would recommend the changes and Court would debate and approve, amend or reject them. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> tussle with the Privy Council and the Department for Education and Skills, Court has lost these powers. Council is now the only body which can make such changes. Court's only residual powers in this respect are the ability to delay changes to the constitutions of itself and of Convocation; powers which were only barely retained.|$|E

He introduced the company, Pro Batter Sports, to the England & Wales Cricket Board and in 2010 Pro Batter completed the installation of two units at the National Performance Centre at Loughborough. Interestingly it was not until Dene Hills, an Australian Cricket Coach, joined the ECB in late 2008, as batting coach, that they finally got in touch with Pro Batter regarding the possibility of using the machines for cricket; something Fountain had identified over a year before.|$|E

Tracking recent kidnapped heroes to a secret base, Lois is introduced to the Kents, who provide a safe house for various heroes after Lana Lang smuggled them out of the facility, and later discovers that the true mastermind behind the conspiracy is Jimmy Olsen, mutated into a Kryptonian through genetic experiments carried out based on DNA samples found in Kal-El's crashed and abandoned ship. Jimmy is finally defeated by Kal-El, who was here raised by an Amish couple until their deaths at Olsen's hands, with Lois writing about how Kal-El's time with the Kents helped him accept his abilities and grow into the Superman he should have been.|$|E
25|$|The Oirat Mongol leader Esen Tayisi {{launched}} an invasion into Ming China in July 1449. The chief eunuch Wang Zhen encouraged the Zhengtong Emperor (r. 1435–1449) to personally lead {{a force to}} face the Mongols <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> Ming defeat; marching off with 50,000 troops, the emperor left the capital and put his half-brother Zhu Qiyu in charge of affairs as temporary regent. In the battle that ensued, his force of 50,000 troops were decimated by Esen's army. On 3 September 1449, the Zhengtong Emperor was captured and held in captivity by the Mongols—an event known as the Tumu Crisis. After the Zhengtong Emperor's capture, Esen's forces plundered {{their way across the}} countryside and {{all the way to the}} suburbs of Beijing. Following this was another plundering of the Beijing suburbs in November of that year by local bandits and Ming dynasty soldiers of Mongol descent who dressed as invading Mongols. Many Han Chinese also took to brigandage soon after the Tumu incident.|$|E
25|$|Police {{used to have}} blue-colored {{emergency}} lights but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> restock of vehicles, now the use of both {{blue and}} red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles {{in case of an}} emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency light bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.|$|E
