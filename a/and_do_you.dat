500|$|Rather Ripped is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 2004 album Sonic Nurse and the band's first record after {{the departure of}} multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke, who joined {{the group as a}} fifth member in 1999. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, O'Rourke left the band to pursue film work and other recording projects. His departure affected the sound of Rather Ripped, with singer and guitarist Thurston Moore stating that the new record [...] "is just a far more straight up rock and roll album", in contrast to the [...] "darker, twisted, complex quality" [...] of O'Rourke's contributions. Moore also explained that he decided to write simpler songs [...] "for everybody to plug into immediately". The album's working titles were Sonic Life <b>and</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> Believe in Rapture? The name [...] "Rather Ripped" [...] came from a Berkeley, California record store that later moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.|$|E

In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo.

500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. <b>And</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think this intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E
