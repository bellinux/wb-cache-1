40|$|In {{multiband}} systems, such as iron-based superconductors, the superconducting {{states with}} locking and <b>anti-locking</b> of the interband phase differences, are usually considered as mutually exclusive. For example, a dirty two-band system with interband impurity scattering undergoes a sharp crossover between the s_± state (that favors phase <b>anti-locking)</b> and the s_++ state (that favors phase locking). We discuss {{here that the}} situation can be much more complex {{in the presence of}} an external field or superconducting currents. In an external applied magnetic field, dirty two-band superconductors do not feature a sharp s_±→ s_++ crossover but rather a washed-out crossover to a finite region in the parameter space where both s_± and s_++ states can coexist for example as a lattice or a microemulsion of inclusions of different states. The current-carrying regions such as the regions near vortex cores can exhibit s_± state while it is the s_++ state that is favored in the bulk. This coexistence of both states can even be realized in the Meissner state at the sample's boundaries featuring Meissner currents. We demonstrate that there is a magnetic-field-driven crossover between the pure s_± and the s_++ states. Comment: This is a follow-up, extedending arXiv: 1707. 06412; 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Anti-locking</b> {{brake systems}} (ABS) are well {{established}} in the automotive industry as a safety feature. ABS generally offers superior vehicle safety by limiting the longitudinal wheel slip in a braking event with deep slip condition. In this paper is presented a structure solution of elastic element from electromagnetic valve that has the roll to reduce the noise and vibrations from brake pedal. At the same time, this solution improve the dynamic of ABS regulator of the vehicle, allowing an increase of frequency of work and, implicit the reducing the braking space. Drivers would have better directional control of the vehicle equipped with ABS. The performances of constructive solution depending on achieving own resonance frequency are presented and confirmed in this paper by means of results obtained experimentally.

40|$|A {{combined}} accelerator-brake pedal in {{passenger cars}} is {{a device that}} combines the accelerating and braking functions in one pedal. This device {{is known as the}} CAB system. The aim of the CAB system is to save the time that is normally spent in moving the foot from the accelerator to the brake pedal. It is asserted that in an emergency situation either the accident risk or the serious outcome of an accident can be reduced by the gain in time. This paper investigates whether the literature regarding this assertion is indeed correct. The paper provides statements about the real road safety gain caused by the CAB system. It is concluded that the literature used gives a clear indication that a further road safety improvement is possible by shortening the brake reaction time. The paper briefly describes alternative systems for the brake distance improvement. These systems include: (1) the Advanced Brake Light Device (ABLD). The ABLD system enables that the braking lights are energized sooner than they would be normally; (2) the third brake light; and (3) the <b>anti-locking</b> braking system (ABS). Another possibility for improving the brake distance is to improve the driving behaviour...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} {{an innovative}} formulation for simple linear tetrahedral elements non-sensitive to volumetric locking. Tetrahedral meshes enable {{to deal with}} high deformation by using efficient and robust adaptive meshers - while standard explicit formulations based on linear hexahedral elements with reduced integration and hourglassing stabilization cannot be coupled with efficient remeshing procedures. The principle of this <b>anti-locking</b> modification is to impose the volumetric constraints at each node instead of at each integration point, as {{been done in the}} averaged nodal pressure formulation proposed by Bonet in 1998. However, the modification made here is material independent: the strain tensor is directly modified before any stress or pressure calculus. The formulation is extended to incompressible elasticity and von Mises incompressible isotropic inelasticity (elastic-visco-plasticity). An infinitesimal strain formulation has been chosen in order to obtain a very simple and thus computational time saving algorithm. This choice can be easily justified taking into account the value of the critical time step in explicit simulations, especially for metal-forming processes. Standard elastic and inelastic benchmarks issued from the literature validate qualitatively and quantitatively this promising formulation for quasi-incompressible deformations cases...|$|E

In particular efforts to improve driving safety and comfort under all driving conditions have been naturally focused on the chassis behavior. During the last decade, active control of vibration isolation in automotive vehicle has known a growing interest in research. In particular the interest of robust control approaches (such as H 1 approach for Linear Parameter Varying systems), and of predictive ones (such as Model Predictive control) has been recently emphasized {{in the context of}} active suspension.

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{regenerative}} braking mode can reduce overall vehicle energy usage {{for most of the}} most common drive cycles. However, a number of technical issues restrict the use of {{regenerative braking}} for all possible braking situations. These issues are concerned with two key limitations. The first is related to physical limitations of the applied regenerative braking system, e. g. Electric Motor (E-Motor) power limits; energy storage device capacity and vehicle load transfer etc. The second limitation results from the potentially detrimental interaction between regenerative braking and the <b>Anti-locking</b> Braking System (ABS). The first type of limitation can, to some extent, be alleviated by suitable choice of hardware and, as a consequence, will not be discussed further in this paper. The second type of limitation concerns the regenerative braking strategies during an ABS event. Some of the regenerative braking strategies designed and investigated within the Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project (LCVTP) will be described and analyzed in this paper. A comparison of competing strategies is made and conclusions are drawn together with suggestions for further research. The work has been progressed {{as a part of a}} major research programme; namely the LCVTP, which has been conducted within an extensive industrial and academic partnership, mutually funded by the European Regional Development Found and Advantage West Midlands...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new model for {{predicting}} the speed gradient of peak friction values on asphalt pavements based on surface characteristics. The innovative feature of the proposed model is the reliable estimation of peak friction values experienced by vehicles equipped with <b>anti-locking</b> brake system (ABS) at a certain vehicle speed. In order to define the experimental model, several types of Dense Asphalt Concrete (DAC) surface layers, with different surface characteristics, are analyzed by in situ tests. Friction {{is measured by the}} Skiddometer BV 11 and the British Pendulum Tester whilst texture properties are measured by a laser profilometer. The Rado model is used to predict peak friction values at 3 different vehicle speeds and, by using these data, the gradient of peak friction values is determined for each pavement section. The spectral analysis of pavement profile data allows to define a texture parameter that is negatively correlated with peak friction values; this parameter is introduced in a new formulation of the speed number SP* that {{is a measure of the}} pavement macrotexture influencing peak friction values. The speed number SP* is used in the new exponential model proposed to defining the gradient of peak friction values. The obtained results show the model is highly reliable and, as it enables to identify texture characteristics to be modified in order to optimize peak friction values, it is particularly useful for the optimization of the mix design and maintenance of pavement surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Landslides cause {{significant}} damage {{and loss of}} life around the world each year. To help protect people, infrastructure, and lifelines against such disasters, it is critical to: a.) control the path and/or redirect flow when potential interaction with the built environment exists, and b.) have engineered structures {{that are capable of}} resisting the loads imparted by a landslide. Capturing the mechanical behavior and structural interaction is challenging [...] -as these flow events are highly dynamic, unpredictable, and inherently complex in nature. This dissertation presents the Material Point Method (MPM) as a continuum-based tool for modeling landslides and other flow-like events, with an emphasis on capturing the force interaction between the flow and rigid structures. Key challenges arising in this context are the ability to: a.) ~model the transition between solid and fluid-like behavior within a single numerical environment, b.) ~develop constitutive frameworks that can accommodate extremely large deformations while remaining computationally efficient and numerically stable, and c.) account for the different phases and constituents that comprise these events This research addresses these challenges and includes an <b>anti-locking</b> enhancement designed to improve kinematics {{and the quality of the}} stress field, a volume constraint for multiphase simulations, and an evaluation of different elasto-plastic material models suitable for large deformation analyses of granular materials. The current implementation is used to model several examples from both the solid and fluid mechanics regime, including incompressible fluid flow, the response of an elastic cantilever beam, three fully saturated porous media analyses, a ductile hyper-velocity Taylor bar impact, a parametric investigation of planar granular flow, snow avalanche simulation, and three landslide applications evaluating the nature of the force interaction with structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen {{computers}} invading our society: computers are now present at work to improve productivity and at home to enlarge the scope of our hobbies and to communicate. Furthermore, computers {{have been involved in}} many critical systems such as <b>anti-locking</b> braking systems (ABS) in our cars, airplane control systems, space rockets, nuclear power plants, banking and trading systems, medical care systems, and so on. The importance of these systems requires a high level of trust in computer-based systems. For example, a failure in a trading system (even if it is temporary) may result in severe economical losses. Hence coping with failures is a key aspect of computer systems. A common approach to tolerate failures is to replicate a system that provides a critical service, so that once a failure occurs on a given replica, the requests to the critical service are still executed by other replicas. This approach has the advantage of masking failures, i. e., requests to the service are continuously executed even in the presence of failures. However, replication introduces a performance cost, mainly because the execution of the service requests must be coordinated among all replicas. Furthermore, despite its apparent simplicity, replication is rather complex to implement. Replication is made easier by group communication which defines several abstractions that can be used by the designer of replicated systems. The group communication abstractions are implemented by distributed protocols that compose a group communication middleware. The aim of the thesis is to study two techniques to improve the performance of group communication middleware, and thus, reduce the cost of replication. First, we study dynamic protocol update, which allows group communication middleware to adapt to environment changes. More particularly, dynamic protocol update consists in replacing at runtime a given protocol composing the group communication middleware with a similar but more efficient protocol. The thesis provides several solutions to dynamic protocol update. For instance, we describe two algorithms to dynamically replace consensus and atomic broadcast, two essential protocols of a group communication middleware. Second, we propose solutions to introduce concurrency within a group communication middleware in order to benefit from the advantages offered by multiprocessor (or multicore) computers...|$|E
