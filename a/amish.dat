5|$|In 2000, the White Deer Hole Creek {{watershed}} {{population was}} 2,672. In the 1970s, <b>Amish</b> began {{moving to the}} Elimsport area from Lancaster County. In 1995 there were over 200 <b>Amish</b> in more than twenty families. In comparison, Washington Township's population was 1,613 in 2000. Elimsport has <b>Amish</b> harness, machine repair, and food shops, and a new one-room school was built nearby in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Writer Mike Schur made a cameo {{appearance}} in the episode, appearing in a photograph as Dwight's <b>Amish</b> cousin Mose. The idea for Schur to be Dwight's <b>Amish</b> cousin had been a joke among the writers since the first season.

5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the <b>Amish</b> migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellisâ€“van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the <b>Amish</b> than in the general population.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, McCool {{was sent}} to another {{developmental}} territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), for a gimmick tryout with <b>Amish</b> Roadkill and Kasey James, also continued her training. While in OVW, she began managing the duo of <b>Amish</b> Roadkill and Kasey James. On May 3, Roadkill and Kasey James, accompanied by McCool, defeated The Untouchables (Deuce and Domino), who were accompanied by Cherry Pie. On May 5, Roadkill and James, with McCool at ringside, lost a dark match on SmackDown against William Regal and Sylvan.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Colonies {{were the}} religiously diverse {{part of the}} British Empire, {{with a high degree}} of tolerance. The Penn family were Quakers, and the colony became a {{favorite}} destination for that group as well as German Lutherans, German Reformed and numerous small sects such as Mennonites, <b>Amish</b> and Moravians, not to mention Scotch Irish Presbyterians. The Dutch Reformed were strong in upstate New York and New Jersey, and Congregationalists were important in Long Island. The First Great Awakening invigorated religiosity and helped stimulate the growth of Congregational, Methodist and Baptist churches. Non-British colonists included Dutch Calvinist, Swedish Lutherans, Palatine Mennonites, and the <b>Amish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of two polio vaccines {{led to the}} first modern mass inoculations. The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic transmission of wild virus in the United States occurred in 1979, with an outbreak among the <b>Amish</b> in several Midwest states.|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a Trinitrotoluene (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many <b>Amish).</b>|$|E
5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the <b>Amish</b> and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|The Immortals of Meluha is {{the first}} novel of the Shiva trilogy series by <b>Amish</b> Tripathi. The story {{is set in the}} land of Meluha and starts {{with the arrival of the}} Shiva. The Meluhans believe that Shiva is their fabled saviour Neelkanth. Shiva decides to help the Meluhans in their war against the Chandravanshis, who had joined forces with a cursed Nagas; however, during his journey and the fight that ensues, Shiva learns how his choices {{actually}} reflect who he aspires to be and how they lead to dire consequences.|$|E
5|$|The series eight premiere is {{the first}} episode in the eighth series of the British espionage {{television}} series Spooks, and the 65th episode in total. It was originally broadcast on BBC One on 4 November 2009. The episode was written by Ben Richards and directed by Alrick Riley. It continues from the seventh series finale, where Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) is willingly captured by Viktor Sarkisiian (Peter Sullivan). In this episode, Harry is taken by <b>Amish</b> Mani (Ace Bhatti), a former Indian intelligence officer, who wants Harry to reveal {{the location of a}} secret uranium shipment he knows the location of, in order to build nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation has more to do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, <b>Amish</b> forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
5|$|The Secret of the Nagas is {{the second}} novel of the Shiva trilogy series by the Indian author <b>Amish</b> Tripathi. The story {{takes place in the}} {{imaginary}} land of Meluha and narrates how the inhabitants of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, where he finds a surprise waiting for him.|$|E
5|$|The Oath of the Vayuputras is a 2013 {{novel by}} Indian author <b>Amish</b> Tripathi {{and the final}} book in his Shiva trilogy. The book was {{released}} on 27 February 2013, through Westland Press and completes the mythical story about an imaginary land Meluha and how its inhabitants were saved by a nomad named Shiva. Starting from where the previous installment left off, Shiva discovers that Somras is the true evil in The Oath of the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares a holy war on {{those who seek to}} continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as {{the music of the}} <b>Amish,</b> the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|A patient, Jillian Miller (Jessica Stroup), is {{admitted}} in obstetrics and gynaecology, and is revealed {{to suffer from}} advanced cervical cancer, which leads to her contacting her parents, from whom she ran away from years ago, along with her best friend Rachel Meyer (Rachel Boston). Stevens quickly becomes emotionally involved in the patient's situation and encourages her to return home, after learning that the two girls were <b>Amish,</b> shunned from their natal village. Torres and Yang operate on a runner who {{is admitted}} in orthopedics, coping {{with the news that}} he {{will never be able to}} compete in races after the extensive surgical procedure. Sloan announces his plans of returning to New York City, but abruptly decides to stay in Seattle, following Grey accidentally revealing Webber's retirement plans. Shepherd is displeased with Sloan's decision, which results in an argument between him and Grey, which threatens putting damage on their relationship. Webber returns to his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine), seeking forgiveness, but is left devastated at the realization that she has been spending the night with another man. Bailey ultimately finds support in Stevens, who proves enthusiastic to spend her entire US$8 million inheritance, for the opening of the free clinic. At the conclusion of the episode, Yang confides in Burke, who unexpectedly proposes to her, whereas O'Malley, who finally admits how affected he was by the death of his father, proposes to Torres.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} no {{division}} in Europe, the <b>Amish</b> congregations remaining there took {{the same way as}} the change-minded <b>Amish</b> Mennonites in North America and slowly merged with the Mennonites. The last <b>Amish</b> congregation in Germany to merge was the Ixheim <b>Amish</b> congregation, which merged with the neighboring Mennonite Church in 1937. Some Mennonite congregations, including most in Alsace, are descended directly from former <b>Amish</b> congregations.|$|E

25|$|<b>Amish</b> cuisine {{is noted}} for its {{simplicity}} and traditional qualities. Food plays {{an important part in}} <b>Amish</b> social life and is served at potlucks, weddings, fundraisers, farewells and other events.

25|$|While the <b>Amish</b> {{are at an}} {{increased}} risk for some genetic disorders, researchers have found their tendency for clean living can lead to better health. Overall cancer rates in the <b>Amish</b> are reduced and tobacco-related cancers in <b>Amish</b> adults are 37 percent and non-tobacco-related cancers are 72 percent of the rate for Ohio adults. The <b>Amish</b> are protected against many types of cancer both through their lifestyle and through genes that may reduce their susceptibility to cancer. Even skin cancer rates are lower for <b>Amish,</b> despite the fact many <b>Amish</b> make their living working outdoors where {{they are exposed to}} sunlight. They are typically covered and dressed by wearing wide-brimmed hats and long sleeves which protect their skin.|$|E
25|$|Only a few outsiders, {{so-called}} seekers, {{have ever}} joined the <b>Amish.</b> Since 1950 only some 75 people have joined and remained {{members of the}} <b>Amish.</b> Since 1990 some twenty people of Russian Mennonite background have joined the <b>Amish</b> in Aylmer, Ontario.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Amish</b> do {{not usually}} educate their {{children}} past the eighth grade, {{believing that the}} basic knowledge offered {{up to that point}} is sufficient to prepare one for the <b>Amish</b> lifestyle. Almost no <b>Amish</b> go to high school and college. In many communities, the <b>Amish</b> operate their own schools, which are typically one-room schoolhouses with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from the <b>Amish</b> community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order <b>Amish,</b> and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative <b>Amish</b> Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E

25|$|A Roberts family {{spokesman}} said an <b>Amish</b> neighbor comforted the Roberts family {{hours after the}} shooting and extended forgiveness to them. <b>Amish</b> community members visited and comforted Roberts' widow, parents, and parents-in-law. One <b>Amish</b> man held Roberts' sobbing father in his arms, reportedly {{for as long as}} an hour, to comfort him. The <b>Amish</b> have also set up a charitable fund for the family of the shooter. About 30 members of the <b>Amish</b> community attended Roberts' funeral, and Marie Roberts, the widow of the killer, {{was one of the few}} outsiders invited to the funeral of one of the victims.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 Pathway Publishers {{was founded}} by two <b>Amish</b> farmers to print more print {{material}} about the <b>Amish</b> and Anabaptists in general. It is located in Lagrange, Indiana, and Aylmer, Ontario. Pathway has become the major publisher of <b>Amish</b> material. Pathway publishes a number of school text books, general reading books, and periodicals. There are also a number of private enterprises who publish everything from general reading to reprints of older literature that has been considered of great value to <b>Amish</b> families. Some <b>Amish</b> read the Pennsylvania German newspaper Hiwwe wie Driwwe, {{and some of them}} even contribute dialect texts.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{concentration}} of <b>Amish</b> {{west of the}} Mississippi River is in Missouri, with other settlements in eastern Iowa and southeast Minnesota. The largest <b>Amish</b> settlements in Iowa are located near Kalona and Bloomfield. Another major settlement of 10,000 Old Order <b>Amish</b> is also located in west central Wisconsin. Because of rapid population growth in <b>Amish</b> communities, new settlements are formed to obtain enough farmland. Other reasons for new settlements include locating in isolated areas that support their lifestyle, moving to areas with cultures conducive to their way of life, maintaining proximity to family or other <b>Amish</b> groups, and sometimes to resolve church or leadership conflicts.|$|E

25|$|While {{speakers}} {{without an}} Anabaptist background in general do not pass the dialect {{to their children}} today, the Old Order <b>Amish</b> and horse-and-buggy Old Order Mennonites {{do so in the}} current generation and there are no signs that this practice will end in the future. There are only two car driving Anabaptist groups who have preserved the dialect: The Old Beachy <b>Amish</b> and the Kauffman <b>Amish</b> Mennonites, also called Sleeping Preacher Churches. Even though <b>Amish</b> and Old Order Mennonites were originally a minority group within the Pennsylvania German-speaking population, today they form the vast majority.
