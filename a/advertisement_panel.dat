40|$|The main {{information}} of a webpage is usually mixed between menus, <b>advertisements,</b> <b>panels,</b> and other not necessarily related information; {{and it is}} often difficult to automatically isolate this infor-mation. This is precisely the objective of content extraction, a research area of widely interest due to its many applications. Content extraction is useful not only for the final human user, but it is also frequently used as a preprocessing stage of different systems that need to extract the main content in a web document to avoid the treatment and processing of other useless information. Other interesting application where content extraction is particularly used is displaying webpages in small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs. In this work we present a new technique for content extraction that uses the DOM tree of the webpage to analyze the hierarchical relations of the elements in the webpage. Thanks to this information, the technique achieves a considerable recall and precision. Using the DOM structure for content extraction gives us the benefits of other approaches based on the syntax of the webpage (such as characters, words and tags), but it also gives us a very precise information regarding the related components in a block, thus, producing very cohesive blocks. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} the commercial value and accessibility of pages, most content sites tend to publish their pages with intra-site redundant information, such as navigation <b>panels,</b> <b>advertisements</b> and copyright announcements. Such redundant information increases the index size of general search engines and causes page topics to drift. In this paper, we study {{the problem of}} mining intra-page informative structure in news Web sites {{in order to find}} and eliminate redundant information. Note that intra-page informative structure is a sub-set of the original Web page and is composed of a set of fine-grained and informative blocks. The intra-page informative structures of pages in a news Web site contain only anchors linking to news pages or bodies of news articles. We propose an intra-page informative structure mining system called WISDOM (Web Intra-page Informative Structure Mining based on the Document Object Model) which applies Information Theory to DOM tree knowledge in order to build the structure. WISDOM splits a DOM tree into many small sub-trees and applies a top-down informative block searching algorithm to select a set of candidate informative blocks. The structure is built by expanding the set using proposed merging methods. Experiments on several real news Web sites show high precision and recall rates which validates WISDOM’s practical applicability...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} mining the {{informative}} structure of a news Web site which consists of thousands of hypedinked documents. We define the informative structure of a news Web site {{as a set of}} index pages (or referred to as TOC, i. e., table of contents, pages) and a set of article pages linked by TOC pages through informative links. It is noted that the Hypedink Induced Topics Search (HITS) algorithm has been employed to provide a solution to analyzing authorities and hubs of pages. However, most of the content sites tend to contain some extra hypedinks, such as navigation <b>panels,</b> <b>advertisements</b> and banners, so as to increase the add-on values of their Web pages. Therefore, due to the structure induced by these extra hypedinks, HITS is found to be insufficient to provide a good precision in solving the problem. To remedy this, we develop an algorithm to utilize entropy-based Link Analysis on Mining Web Informative Structures. This algorithm is referred to as L 4 MIS. The key idea of LAMIS is to utilize information entropy for representing the knowledge that corresponds to the amount of information in a link or a page in the link analysis. Experiments on several real news Web sites show that the precision and the recall of LAMIS are much superior to those obtained by heuristic methods and conventional ink analysis methods...|$|R

Eventually, Kondaiah Raju and his group began to work for the newly set up litho printing presses of Sivakasi. Everything was coming together in this kind of work: photography, European techniques of perspective and lighting, new materials for painting, traditional religious imagery. But what made Kondiah Raju acquire a status, and leave a deep impression on the ‘religious arts’ of contemporary South India — and South-East Asia, one might add — were the images of Hindu divinities that he turned out in such large numbers, Murugan, Kannan, Meenakshi, Ganapati, among them: iconographically conforming to traditional canons, dramatically lit and softly modelled. His Gajendra Motcham, Meenakshi Kalyanam and many other religious prints are considered unrivalled masterpieces and continue to adorn the puja rooms of South Indian households and smaller shrines across the Tamil country. So pervasive are his prints that many South Indians would visualise and recognise not only the many deities, but also leaders of the Indian freedom movement, contemporary political leaders and other important personalities only as depicted in his prints. His prints have been collected internationally and are even archived in the Victoria and Albert Museum, H. Daniel Smith Poster Archive, Syracuse University library.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or web pages) of a web site. Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag in a web page. Based on statistics on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature. According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined. By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the threshold of entropy that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant. Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts. Based on the answer set generated from 13 manually tagged news web sites with a total of 26518 web pages, experiments show that both recall and precision rates are greater than 0. 95. That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as <b>advertisements,</b> banners, navigation <b>panels,</b> news categories, etc. Note that the size of informative blocks of a page is much smaller than that of the page. Thus, by adopting the proposed method in information retrieval and extraction applications, it not only increases the retrieval and extracting precision but also reduces the indexing size and extracting complexity...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concept is}} that public space {{is not a}} private property. So, a facade (the outer skin, the last millimeter)  belongs to the town, not to {{the owner of the}} building. Changing the rendering, a window, adding or removing anything from a facade requires a permission delivered by the town's authority. In places like Paris, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Lyon, Strasbourg… everywhere one can find a registrated building such as a cathedral, a castle, or a group of ancient buildings, a national administration is controlling this permission. This administration is called «historical monuments administration» and is locally lead by a specialized architect. In the late seventies, French government decided to reduce advertising on the roads and on the city walls. Advertising on the road was leading to a confusion reducing the efficacy of the roadsigns and direction signs, which is dangerous. The reduction was under control of a national administration: the ministry of equipment in charge of the roads design. Advertising on the walls with publicity boards was under control of the cities. Every city has a townplanning regulation. Many cities included forbidding advertisement boards on the walls in this regulation. A couple of firms, but mainly once (Decaux) found clever to give a hand to the cities to control advertising. Decaux developed a line of bus stop shelters including <b>advertisements</b> and advertising <b>panels</b> and paid the cities the right to put rather smaller publicities on the public domain. Now Decaux is no more alone on this market and the cities are comparing offers. Marseille turned to a foreign advertising firm who pays three times the price Decaux paid… for half of the advertising surface.  Freiburg erased totally the public domain advertisements, selling the tramways and bus coachwork as advertising spaces.  Paris is reopening the advertising market before the end of Deacaux's contract and will pay Deacaux a huge amount for this breach of contract. But the price paid by the new contracting party is expected to be over ten times what Decaux is presently paying… So Bertrand de la Noe, the Lord Mayor, decided to reduce by three or four the surface. The Paris citizen will earn  2. 5 to 3 times more money getting also a cleaner public space.  Yes… as public space, public money belongs to the community of the citizen… The other fundamental laws are commercial: on one hand «low offers make high prices» {{and on the other hand}} «too many signs are insignificant». Reducing the number of signs makes the remaining signs more readable, which is the first quality of advertising. That is why every one seems to be satisfied with few publicity. The town gets more money out of it and offers a nice townscape. The publishers are sure to be alone on the market as long as they keep the contract. The publishers are sure to be alone on the market as long as they keep the contract. The firms are guaranteed to be well seen. </p...|$|R
