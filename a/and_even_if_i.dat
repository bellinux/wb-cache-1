The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E
500|$|English fantasy author Neil Gaiman guest {{starred in}} the episode as himself, helping Homer and the others write the book. He {{recorded}} his lines in January 2011 in Los Angeles, California {{under the direction of}} Selman. Gaiman has said that when he first agreed to guest star, he assumed he would only be getting a brief appearance, popping up for a few seconds. He told the press that [...] "when they actually sent me the script and I started to read it and discovered that I was in it all the way through and was actually having to act and that stuff happened, it was enormously fun." [...] Gaiman also noted that he does not think the episode gives an entirely accurate portrayal of him, commenting: [...] "Truthfully, the real-life me almost never hangs around in Barnes & Noble-like bookstores waiting to find groups of local townsfolk who've decided to write pseudonymous young adult fantasy series, offering my services. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did, I probably wouldn't be doing the catering." [...] On his official Tumblr page, Gaiman noted that while he did not have much input on the story, he got to improvise while recording and gave suggestions on how to make his dialogue sound as close to something he might actually say in real life.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would always}} indulge myself with books <b>and</b> periodicals, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to scrimp elsewhere," [...] said Mr. Lennox; {{and he spoke}} of scrimping with all the serious good faith with which people {{of two or three}} {{thousand}} a year usually speak of these matters.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have your}} letter and check. You may not believe it, but [...] {{the former is}} worth {{more to me than}} the latter. Not, [...] however, that I spurn the check, which it was just like you [...] to send without a lot of grumbling <b>and</b> reproaches, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> [...] do deserve them.|$|R
2500|$|Nick and Sharon's highly {{anticipated}} 2009 reunion was {{met with}} a notable public reaction. SoapNet wrote [...] "the stage was being set for a much-anticipated reunion between first loves Nick Newman and Sharon Collins. Nick's wife, Phyllis, had been scheming to keep them apart for months, {{and a lot of}} fans were looking forward to her comeuppance just as much as Nick and Sharon's hookup." [...] Additionally, the Soap Opera Network magazine noted a [...] "sudden boom" [...] in ratings in the episodes surrounding their reunion, which was also attributed to other subplots.

[...] Of working with Joshua Morrow, Case stated: [...] "I feel most comfortable when I am working with him. We have worked together for so many years, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have not worked with him in a long time, I go right back into a groove with him that’s familiar and easy".|$|E

"Never mind," [...] {{said his}} mother; [...] "sometimes, when I make a call, I {{find that the}} lady I have called to see is not at home; <b>and</b> then, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am tired <b>and</b> want to rest, I {{have to go on}} to the next house. We will suppose that at this place the lady is not at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{you put it}} in that way, sir. My choice is made. I am engaged to this young lady, and shall {{certainly}} marry her.

6000|$|... "Oh, what {{is there}} to confide? The people are savorless and proud of it. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> liked you tremendously, I couldn't talk to you without twenty old hexes watching, whispering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the better}} for the change. I shall see and hear new things, get new ideas, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> haven't much time there, I shall bring home {{quantities}} of material for my rubbish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when we retires {{they all}} pitches into me, and says as it's monstrous one man should hold out agin eleven; <b>and</b> that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't feel sure myself, I {{ought to go}} as the others went.

6000|$|... "Do; it {{is anxious}} work for Myra there, and I {{want to get}} back as soon as I can. Her mother is asleep, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> she wakes <b>I</b> do not think she will be able to talk much." ...|$|R
