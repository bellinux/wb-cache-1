5|$|In 1960, Allan Williams, the Beatles manager, {{arranged}} {{a season of}} bookings in Hamburg, starting on 17 August 1960, but complained {{that they did not}} impress him, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> he could find a better act.|$|E
5|$|Bill Moreau, chief {{engineer}} of the New York State Bridge Authority, {{was impressed by}} the project.

5|$|The {{influential}} eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw {{problems with}} all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> a new articulation of the doctrine would be made. He emphasized the function of the Supper of confirming Christians' union with Christ as well as the union they have with one another.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the title}} page of the book, George J. Nicholls was the {{director}} of George Bowles, Nicholls & Company. He was also a Trustee, Member of Council, Chairman of Finance Committee, and honorary Examiner to the Institute of Certificated Grocers. He was {{also a member of the}} Home and Foreign Produce Exchange and Chairman of Committee of the Wholesale Produce Merchants' Association in London. Nicholls followed in the footsteps of his father in the provision trade <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> two of his three sons would continue the family tradition.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.|$|E

Nonetheless, he left his troops at Malvern Hill and {{traveled}} downstream aboard the ironclad USS Galena to inspect his army's future resting place at Harrison's Landing. McClellan did not delegate an interim commander; Porter, who was in command during the initial attack, became the de facto leader on the Union side of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Walsingham's cousin Edward Denny {{fought in}} Ireland during the {{rebellion}} of the Earl of Desmond {{and was one}} of the English settlers granted land in Munster confiscated from Desmond. Walsingham's stepson Christopher Carleill commanded the garrisons at Coleraine and Carrickfergus. Walsingham thought Irish farmland was underdeveloped <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> plantation would improve the productivity of estates. Tensions between the native Irish and the English settlers had lasting effects on the history of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E

Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California where he wanted to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{had raised}} $1.7 {{million by the}} time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He {{realized}} that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> this might lead to greater generosity. A week after his run ended, the CTV Television Network organized a nationwide telethon in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.|$|E
5|$|Gough Whitlam {{saw that}} the party had little chance of being elected unless it could expand its appeal from the {{traditional}} working-class base to include the suburban middle class. He sought to shift control of the ALP from union officials to the parliamentary party, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> even rank-and-file party members could be given {{a voice in the}} conference. In 1968, controversy erupted within the party when the executive refused to seat new Tasmanian delegate Brian Harradine, a Whitlam supporter who was considered a right-wing extremist. Whitlam resigned the leadership, demanding a vote of confidence from caucus. He defeated Cairns for the leadership in an unexpectedly close 38–32 vote. Despite the vote, the executive refused to seat Harradine.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010, Howling Bells started {{recording}} The Loudest Engine at the Killers-owned Battle Born Studios in Las Vegas. It {{was produced}} by bassist Mark Stoermer, whom the group had met while it toured with The Killers. The relationship between Stoermer and Howling Bells strengthened after the band disembarked from its flight to Las Vegas. The flight had been delayed by more than 12 hours, but he had nonetheless waited for them at the airport. Howling Bells were impressed by his style of work. Rather than overproducing, he kept the amount of takes to a minimum and allowed the band just to play, which kept the sessions very natural. The band members became less conscious of trying to please other people, made the record that they wanted, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> it would change people's attitudes toward the band.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast teenagers in the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast teenagers in the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in}} the house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E
5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> they would not be formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{two months}} in Batna with Ehnni, the French ordered her to leave North Africa without explanation; as an immigrant, {{she had no choice}} but to comply. Ehnni requested permission from his military superiors to marry Eberhardt (which would have enabled her to stay), but his request was denied. She traveled to France in early May 1901, staying with Augustin and his wife and daughter in Marseille. In mid-June she was summoned back to Constantine to give evidence at the trial of her attacker, who maintained his statement that God had ordered him to kill Eberhardt, though expressed remorse towards her. Eberhardt said that she bore no grudge against Abdallah, forgave him, <b>and</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> he would not be punished. Abdallah received life imprisonment although the prosecutor had asked for the death penalty. When the trial ended, Eberhardt was again ordered to leave the country. She returned to live with Augustin, working with him (disguised as a man) as a dock labourer. Eberhardt and Augustin's family lived in appalling poverty. Eberhardt's health deteriorated, and she repeatedly suffered from fevers. She attempted suicide while in Marseille, one of several unsuccessful attempts she would make over the course of her life. Eberhardt continued to write during this time, working on several projects including her novel Trimardeur.|$|E
