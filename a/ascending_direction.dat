6000|$|One day, at St. Fé, I had {{a better}} {{opportunity}} of observing some similar facts. A spider which was about three-tenths of an inch in length, and which in its general appearance resembled a Citigrade (therefore {{quite different from the}} gossamer), while standing on the summit of a post, darted forth four or five threads from its spinners. These, glittering in the sunshine, might be compared to diverging rays of light; they were not, however, straight, but in undulations like films of silk blown by the wind. They were more than a yard in length, and diverged in an <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> from the orifices. The spider then suddenly let go its hold of the post, and was quickly borne out of sight. The day was hot and apparently quite calm; yet under such circumstances, the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect a vane so delicate as the thread of a spider's web. If during a warm day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank, or over a level plain at a distant landmark, the effect of an ascending current of heated air is almost always evident: such upward currents, it has been remarked, are also shown by the ascent of soap-bubbles, which will not rise in an indoors room. Hence I think there is not much difficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider's spinners, and afterwards of the spider itself; the divergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained, I believe by Mr. Murray, by their similar electrical condition. The circumstance of spiders of the same species, but of different sexes and ages, being found on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the land, attached in vast numbers to the lines, renders it probable that the habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this tribe, as that of diving is of the Argyroneta. We may then reject Latreille's supposition, that the gossamer owes its origin indifferently to the young of several genera of spiders: although, as we have seen, the young of other spiders do possess the power of performing aerial voyages. (8/7. Mr. Blackwall in his [...] "Researches in Zoology" [...] has many excellent observations on the habits of spiders.) ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} the first cross on the left top with the modal {{signatures}} of protos, tetartos and phthora nenano (φθορά νενανῶ).

If only this tetrachord is chromatic, it is connected to a second diatonic tetrachord between α' and δ', so the signature is protos. In the current tradition the sticheraric melos the tetrachord between α' and δ' is chromatic, so the attraction of νενανῶ moves towards the tetartos, and between δ' and the tetartos octave of the plagios, the diatonic melos follows echos tetartos. In fact, the melos of echos tetartos within the tetrachord G—c today tends to choose the tetartos melos for the <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> (δ'—#α'—β'—πλ δ'), and the protos melos for the descending parallage (δ'—υαρ—♭πλ β'—πλ α').

The scheme would require four tunnels, two with a length of 0.8 km each and two more with lengths of 2.4 km and 13.5 km respectively. The benefits to the SAR would be significant. Operating costs would be decreased {{as a result of the}} elimination of sharp curves and steep gradients. The length of the section would be reduced by 8 km and it would also eliminate altogether 5,280 degrees of curvature and 110 m of false rise in level.

30|$|Cheung and Lam [23] {{observed}} higher {{values of}} capacities and walking speeds on stairways and passageway at Hong Kong Metro stations compared to London underground stations. Further, {{it is found}} that the effect of bidirectional pedestrian flows on staircase are more significant compared to passageway. Cheung and Lam [10] investigated the relationship between speed and flow on stairs and escalators (ascending, descending) and found that pedestrians behaviour differ when they use the facilities in both directions. It is noticed that the pedestrians are more susceptible to relative delay on both the facilities in descending direction compared to <b>ascending</b> <b>direction.</b> Further, it is observed that 85 % of pedestrians are desirous to use an escalator in descending direction when the relative delay is 7.8  s while in <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> it can be up to 17.4  s. This is interpreted {{by the fact that the}} effort in walking in descending direction of a staircase is perceived to be less than walking in <b>ascending</b> <b>direction.</b> Graat et al. [36] found that the capacity and speed are higher on stairs with normal slope (30 °) than the stairs with steeper slope (38 °) which clearly shows that stair gradient effects the velocity and capacity. Lee [11] conducted a study on escalators and staircase in public transport facilities and observed that direction of movement, infrastructure type and pedestrian personal characteristics influences free speeds. Further, it is noticed that men walk faster than women. At Hong Kong MTR stations Lee and Lam [37] investigated the walking speed variations on a unidirectional walkway and a bidirectional stairway and observed that, when the pedestrian flow is reaching the capacity of the facility, the variation in the walking speed is found to be minimal. In addition, it was also observed that the walking times are normally distributed. To predict the pedestrian walking speeds on staircase a linear regression model is developed by Fujiyama and Tyler [12] by considering stair gradient, leg extensor power of pedestrian and weight of the participant. This model shows that the walking speeds are different on various gradients of stairs, while the designers generally neglect these differences. In addition the model is presenting a specific profile in predicting the walking speeds of people. Burghardt et al. [9] conducted an experimental study and a field study on the same staircase and observed a maximum density of 2.9  m− 2 and 3.4  m− 2 respectively. Further, it was observed that the flow values for a given density in experiments are slightly higher than the field values.|$|E

40|$|This report studies {{walking and}} travel choice {{behavior}} of pedestrians concerning stairways and escalators in public transport facilities. With respect to walking behavior of pedestrians, {{we focus on}} deriving traffic characteristics such as free speeds and fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows. Bi-linear models are hypothesized for the speed-density relationships of pedestrian traffic on stairways and escalators. In regard to travel choice behavior of pedestrians, two types of choice behavior are discussed: the first one considers the selection between available stairways and escalators to facilitate level changes; the second one concerns the choice between walking and standing on escalators. To calibrate our hypothesized walking and choice models, observations were conducted in the NS intercity train station of Den Haag Holland Spoor on the 1 st of June, 2005 (Wednesday) with a combined technique of infrared detectors and video cameras. 6 infrared detectors were installed to observe trajectories of individual pedestrians while 2 video cameras were used to observe personal characteristics such as gender and age of passengers. Observation data from these two sources will be jointed to allow analysis of pedestrian behavior taking into account their personal characteristics. The observations lasted {{for a period of}} 3. 5 hours without interruption (15 : 40 19 : 10). However, no congestion had been observed. Prior to utilizing the infrared and video data for analysis, some preparatory works had been performed. These preparatory works include: 9 ̆ 5 Convert infrared trajectory data from “pixel” to “cm”, which involves correction for both lens and perspective distortion; 9 ̆ 5 Match split trajectories within one field of view (infrared detector); 9 ̆ 5 Combine infrared trajectory data and personal characteristics read from video films; 9 ̆ 5 Correct (infrared) flow data based on video reading. Our analysis of free speeds show that free speeds are influenced by directions of movement, types of infrastructure, and personal characteristics of pedestrians, namely, gender and age. The free speeds found on stairways are about 0. 77 m/s and 0. 68 m/s in the descending and the <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> respectively; those on escalators are about 0. 88 m/s and 0. 82 m/s in the descending and <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> respectively. Besides, in average, male passengers walk faster than female ones; Moreover, in general, free speeds decrease with age. Our findings concerning the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flows are quite limited due to the small variation of traffic conditions observed. During our observations, the highest flows observed on stairways are 0. 86 P/ms and 0. 18 P/ms in the descending and <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> respectively, while those on escalators are 0. 93 P/ms and 0. 67 P/ms in the descending and <b>ascending</b> <b>direction</b> respectively. With respect to the choice behavior between stairways and escalators, binary logit models are applied for the model formulation. Based on the choice situations at the observation site, factors influencing the choice behavior may include travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, personal characteristics of pedestrians, and vicinity. However, due to the incomplete travel information observed, simplified route networks are proposed for the analysis. In addition, only factors of travel time, physical effort, safety and comfort, and personal characteristic are considered in the utility functions. Our estimated results indicate a weak explanatory power of our hypothesized choice models. Possible explanations include the exclusion of influencing factors such as time pressure and vicinity, incomplete travel time information, possible bias caused by the algorithms applied for the estimation of alternative travel time. In regard to the walk/stand choice behaviour on escalators, our study in this report is limited to the discussion about choice availability and influencing factors. The availability of the walk/stand choice may be determined by the distribution of standing passengers on escalators particularly those near to the entry. In addition, the main factors influencing this stand/walk choice on escalators may include physical effort, travel time and time pressure. Finally, our investigation on pedestrian observations with infrared detectors shows that large amount of trajectory data can be observed and extracted automatically with existing program. Besides, our algorithms applied to correct trajectory data and the method used to join infrared and video data provide satisfactory results. Thus we conclude that the application of infrared detectors on pedestrian observations is promising. However, further studies should be performed to evaluate the accuracy of the detection outcomes and to develop algorithms to match trajectories across different fields of view to expand its possible application on pedestrian study.

40|$|In examininig the {{influence}} of alterations in the inter-polar length of galvanic stimulation on the excitability of a frog's sciatic-gastrocnemius organisation, many experiments were made in which direct current and induction shock and several different arrangements for stimulation were employed. In all this apparatus for electrical stimulation, special precautions were taken to obviate alteration of the current applied. There are three principal theories current {{on the question of}} the effect of altering the inter-polar length of galvanic stimulation on nerve excitability. The first is that the strength of the stimulating current required to produce the minimum muscular twitch becomes lower as the inter-polar length increases. The second, on the contrary, maintains that an opposite effect is achieved; that is to say, that the strength of the current decreases when the inter-polar length increases, because the electrical resistance is thereby also increased. The third opinion is that the effect is in inverse relation to the <b>ascending</b> or descending <b>direction</b> of the current. Reviewing these theories in the light of the results gained from the present experiments, the following conclusions are submitted. (1) The excitability of the frog's sciatic nerve, at first rapidly and then gradually, increases as the interpolar length of the stimulating current is increased. (2) The results of Marcuse and Tschirjew, who insist that the increase of nervous excitability reaches its maximum value at a definite inter-polar length, were not sustained by these experiments. (3) The effect of alteration of the inter-polar length on nerve excitability is independent of the <b>ascending</b> or descending <b>direction</b> of the current, i. e., the direction of the current has no effect on the degree of excitability. (4) The chronaxie of a frog's sciatic nerve becomes shorter as the inter-polar length increases. (5) The phenomenon of polarisation in the nerve fibre, caused by electrical stimulation increases directly with the inter-polar length, because of the reversed direction of ionic diffusion. (6) The influence of a magnetic field, brought to bear on the nerve fibre reduces its excitability...|$|R
5000|$|The Stampede Pass {{railroad}} tunnel is arched in the center; that is, daylight in {{not detectable}} {{at either end}} of the tunnel when looking through to the other end; unlike both the first (2.6 mile, 1900) and second (7.8 mile, 1929) Cascade Tunnels of the Great Northern Railway at Stevens Pass, which were [...] "boresighted" [...] and ran in a straight line and at a constant downward angle from northeast to southwest. Steam engines <b>ascending</b> in either <b>direction</b> within the confines of the Stampede Tunnel was the cause of many train crews and passengers being nearly choked to death by the buildup of exhaust gasses within the tunnel; this led to a forced-air ventilation equipment being added at the west end of the tunnel at a later date. The grade is 2.2 percent on the east side from the town of Easton and 2.2 percent on the west side from the town of Lester.|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} {{can be an}} {{efficient}} and cost-effective technology for acquiring upto-date and relatively accurate land cover and topographic information. Radar interferometry is a remote sensing technique that can measure high resolution topographic profiles of the Earth’s surface. One {{of the most important}} applications of the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique is the extraction of three-dimensional information from radar images of the Earth’s surface. InSAR digital elevation model (DEM) generation relies on the measurement of phase difference between the two sets of complex radar signals, i. e. the range difference between the satellite-borne radar instrument and the ground targets reflecting the radar transmissions. In InSAR DEM generation, the so-called “master image” parameters, such as signal wavelength, incidence angle, and SAR image relationship (i. e. perpendicular baseline), affect the final DEM products. Furthermore, the orbit <b>direction</b> (<b>ascending</b> or descending) provides a different representation of terrain over the same target area. Hence, using images collected by the satellite sensor from different orbit directions is way of improving the quality of InSAR-generated DEMs. The authors propose a combination of two methods to improve DEM quality: firstly, DEM averaging based on the same orbi...|$|R
