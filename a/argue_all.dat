5|$|On Christmas Eve, with Homer's help, the two steal all the Funzo toys from {{underneath}} every Christmas tree in Springfield {{with the intention}} of burning them in the town's long-running tire fire. However, Gary Coleman, who is a security guard at Kid First Industries, comes to stop them. The two parties <b>argue</b> <b>all</b> night until the next morning when they settle down into civilized discussion about the commercialization of Christmas. Coleman changes his opinion about the toy company and helps the Simpsons destroy the remaining functioning Funzo toys that were not destroyed in the tire fire. Afterwards, Homer invites Coleman to Christmas dinner at the Simpson family's house, where Mr. Burns shows up after deciding to donate money to Springfield Elementary following an epiphany he had that night.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{claim that}} for Marx, {{commercial}} trade and asset speculation were unproductive sectors, {{in which no}} new value can be created. Therefore, they <b>argue,</b> <b>all</b> income of these sectors represents a deduction from the new value created in the productive sectors of the economy. Booms in unproductive sectors may temporarily act as a countervailing factor to the TRPF, {{but not in the}} long run. Professor Fred Moseley argues that in the United States the grand-average rate of profit on production capital is lower {{than it was in the}} first decades after World War II, in part because of a rising share of unproductive labor in the total workforce, raising aggregate costs. This is a reason of its own for a falling average rate of profit. It suggested that, if the unproductive labor was [...] "weeded out", then the profit rate would rise.|$|E

2500|$|Another famous fantasy {{episode was}} [...] "Atomic Shakespeare," [...] which {{featured}} the cast performing {{a variation of}} The Taming of the Shrew, with David {{in the role of}} Petruchio, Maddie as Katharina, Agnes as Bianca, and Herbert as Lucentio. The episode featured Shakespearean costumes and mixed the Shakespearean plot with humorous anachronisms and variations on Moonlightings own running gags, including David riding in as Petruchio on a horse with BMW logos embroidered on its saddle blanket and repeatedly launching into the wrong Shakespearean soliloquy until the rest of the cast corrects him on which play he is in, and the Blue Moon office itself serving as Petruchio and Katharina's estate. The characters perform the Shakespearean dialogue in iambic pentameter, and the episode was wrapped by segments featuring a boy imagining the episode's proceedings because his mother forced him to do his Shakespeare homework instead of watching Moonlighting, which the mother described as [...] "That show about two detectives? A man and a woman? And they <b>argue</b> <b>all</b> the time and all they really want to do is sleep together? Sounds like trash to me!" ...|$|E

60|$|FIRST, Perhaps {{it will be}} said, that, {{though it}} be as clear as {{demonstration}} can make it, {{that there must be}} an eternal Being, and that Being must also be knowing: yet it does not follow but that thinking Being may also be MATERIAL. Let it be so, it equally still follows that there is a God. For there be an eternal, omniscient, omnipotent Being, it is certain that there is a God, whether you imagine that Being to be material or no. But herein, I suppose, lies the danger and deceit of that supposition:--there being no way to avoid the demonstration, that there is an eternal knowing Being, men devoted to matter, would willingly have it granted, that that knowing Being is material; and then, letting slide out of their minds, or the discourse, the demonstration whereby an eternal KNOWING Being was proved necessarily to exist, would <b>argue</b> <b>all</b> to be matter, and so deny a God, that is, an eternal cogitative Being: whereby they are so far from establishing, that they destroy their own hypothesis. For, if there can be, in their opinion, eternal matter, without any eternal cogitative Being, they manifestly separate matter and thinking, and suppose no necessary connexion of the one with the other, and so establish the necessity of an eternal Spirit, but not of matter; since it has been proved already, that an eternal cogitative Being is unavoidably to be granted. Now, if thinking and matter may be separated, the eternal existence of matter will not follow from the eternal existence of a cogitative Being, and they suppose it to no purpose.|$|E
