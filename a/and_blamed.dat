40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the rhetorical}} devices of praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> employed in Moses� speeches {{in the book}} of Deuteronomy. Praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> are mainly used in the framework of the central Law Code, Deuteronomy 1 � 11, 26 � 34. Some of the most prominent occurrences of Moses� rhetoric of praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> form literary inclusions, in parallel (Dt 4 : 7; 33; 29) and contrasting (Dt 4 : 6; 29 : 24; 32 : 6) ways. Both praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> are used to inspire faithfulness to God and obedience to the Torah. In this way, Moses forms Israel�s ethical values as the foundation of the people�s legal order. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{encyclopedia}} entry contrasts three influential philosophical {{accounts of}} our everyday practices of praise <b>and</b> <b>blame,</b> {{in terms of}} how they might be justified. On the one hand, a broadly Kantian approach sees responsibility for actions as relying on forms of self-control that point back to the idea of free will. On this account praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> are justified because a person freely chooses her actions. Praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> respond to the person as the chooser of her deed; they recognise her dignity as a rational agent, as Kantians tend to put it. This approach sharply contrasts with two further ways of thinking about the issues. One is utilitarian, where praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> are justified in terms of their social benefits. Another, more complex approach is roughly Aristotelian. This approach situates practices of praise <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> in terms of our on-going relationships with one another. This approach stresses the importance of mutual accountability, moral education, and assessments of character in terms of the many vices and virtues...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to define and analyse the aspects of sin <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> in Unamuno's prosaic work. After brief introduction to Unamuno's intellectual system and the definition of concepts of sin <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> emphasis is put on Unamuno's theoretical demarcation of sin <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> in his essayistic work. From this theoretical basis results the classification of these aspects in each belletristic work, whereas there {{is an effort to}} comment all possible interpretation of these concepts in each work. The analysis of these novels {{from the point of view}} of classification of sin <b>and</b> <b>blame</b> focuses on new possible interpretation and connection in Unamuno's system, which has been till now rather neglected and brings therefore a new point of view on some of it's aspects...|$|R

5|$|Tristano also {{complained about}} the commercialization of jazz and what he {{perceived}} to be the requirement to abandon the artistic part of playing in order to earn a living from performing.

5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990, WMATA {{hired the}} Perini Corp. {{as the new}} contractor, and {{required}} the company {{to finish the job}} and rebuild the streets in the area, setting a new Green Line dedication of December 1991.

5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments.

5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted {{that he did not}} know how to facilitate this.|$|E

5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men, <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying that the dog teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E
5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> himself {{for the death of}} fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|John White Stevenson (May 4, 1812August 10, 1886) was the 25th {{governor}} of Kentucky and represented {{the state in}} both houses of the U.S. Congress. The son of future Speaker of the House and U.S. diplomat Andrew Stevenson, John Stevenson graduated from the University of Virginia in 1832 and studied law under his cousin, future Congressman Willoughby Newton. After briefly practicing law in Mississippi, he relocated to Covington, Kentucky, and was elected county attorney. After serving in the Kentucky legislature, he was chosen as a delegate to the state's third constitutional convention in 1849 and was one of three commissioners charged with revising its code of laws, a task finished in 1854. A Democrat, he was elected to two consecutive terms in the U.S. House of Representatives where he supported several proposed compromises to avert the Civil War <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> the Radical Republicans for their failure.|$|E

Valor por Tamaulipas responded by sending a message to the authorities in Tamaulipas <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the couple was kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E
5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the strike, {{including}} McMenamin and Carney, were charged in federal court under the SmithConnally Act; some thirty strikers were also indicted later. The federal grand jury was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months. However, the grand jury returned inconclusive findings; their report stated {{that most of the}} striking workers knew nothing about the strike at the start, <b>and</b> <b>blamed</b> a few instigators for escalating the situation, but did not detail the instigators' activities. The report was also critical of the PTC's response to the strike, characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective. The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12, 1945, with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $100 each.|$|E
