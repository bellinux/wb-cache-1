40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to add to the {{literature}} on the predictive accuracy of a dynamic intellectual disability specific <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> tool. Method: <b>A</b> dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for sexual reoffending (ARMIDILO-S), <b>a</b> static <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for sexual offending (STATIC- 99), and <b>a</b> static <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for violence (Violence Risk Appraisal Guide [VRAG]) were completed for a sample of 64 adult males with an intellectual disability. Results: The dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for sexual offenders with an intellectual disability resulted in the best prediction of sexual reoffending (ARMIDILO-S area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 92) this was better than an established sexual offending static <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> (STATIC- 99 AUC = 0. 75). A static tool for violent reoffending, did not perform as well in this group (VRAG AUC = 0. 58). Conclusions: Results suggest that dynamic variables are useful in predicting sexual reoffending with individuals with an intellectual disability, confirming previous findings. The ARMIDILO-S is <b>a</b> promising dynamic <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for individuals with an intellectual disability...|$|R

Design: Pre and post intervention cross-sectional cohort study. Setting: Single academic center. Patients: Convenience samples of Internal Medicine residents. Interventions: Residents completed clinical vignettes before and after any exposure to <b>an</b> electronic <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> tool and reminder alert. They were asked to make three determinations using <b>a</b> point-based VTE <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> tool: <b>risk</b> stratification, identify contraindications, and VTE prevention strategy.

Participants were asked about their current <b>assessment</b> of their <b>risk</b> or any risk reduction strategies that they discussed with their healthcare providers. Participants were then asked to provide feedback about the iPad-based <b>risk</b> <b>assessment,</b> their opinions about using it in a clinic setting, and suggestions on how the assessment could be improved. FGD participants were generally receptive to the idea of using <b>an</b> iPad-based <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> during healthcare visits.

25|$|The {{information}} assurance process typically {{begins with the}} enumeration and classification of the information assets to be protected. Next, the IA practitioner will perform <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>assessment</b> for those assets.
