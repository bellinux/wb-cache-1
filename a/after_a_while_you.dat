[...] "It isn't {{pleasant}} to fight continually with a good friend, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> wonder whether he's all that good a friend." [...] Furthermore, Burke suspected that Felt had become an automatic faultfinder, which if true would render his advice as useless as that of an automatic yes-man.

2500|$|Art of Conquests {{music was}} never {{released}} as a soundtrack CD, {{but the music}} in the game received critical approval, receiving [...] 7 out of 10 from GameSpot. IGN described the sound as [...] "convincing enough, with realistic battle noises throughout the game's various ages. Each type of attack makes a particular sound and, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>you</b> can develop {{a good sense of}} the scope of a given battle just by listening to it". IGN gave the sound 7 out of 10 overall, but did have some criticism, remarking that [...] "A few glitches detract from an otherwise sufficient soundtrack. Voices are decent and the music is good. On Monday November 3, 2008, at 7pm GMT, the WON servers, dedicated to the Empire Earth and Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest online game-play system, were permanently shut down by Activision.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison {{was noted}} as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{refreshing}} young faces to light up TV screens this new season." [...] Fox publicists issued press releases glossing over Harrison's deficient education and claiming for her a passion for Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Aristotle which she never possessed. Midway through its second season, Bracken's World was cancelled. Harrison said later that the studio wanted recognizable stars every week, instead of allowing the regular cast to grow as an ensemble, {{as was the case}} with shows such as [...] [...] "Had they done it like a continuing drama and focused on the regular characters, it would have lasted longer," [...] she said. [...] "NBC, however, wanted a one-hour contained show, so they would stock each episode with a big guest star. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>you</b> run out of story.".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990 Hirst, {{along with}} his friend Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising [...] "warehouse" [...] shows, Modern Medicine and Gambler, in a Bermondsey former Peek Freans biscuit factory they {{designated}} [...] "Building One". Saatchi arrived at the second show in a green Rolls Royce and, according to Freedman, stood open-mouthed with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst's first major [...] "animal" [...] installation, A Thousand Years, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow's head. They also staged Michael Landy's Market. At this time, Hirst said, [...] "I can’t wait {{to get into a}} position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say 'f off'. But <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> can get away with things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Isaac Asimov {{recounted in}} his second autobiographical volume In Joy Still Felt seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954, during which he sang very cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, [...] "and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>you</b> {{gathered}} the 'it' to be venereal disease [...] Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every perversion known to mankind without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." [...] Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. [...] "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," [...] said Asimov, [...] "but of all the times I have gone, it was on this occasion that I had {{by far the best}} time." ...|$|E

5000|$|To {{be honest}} with you, I find the Baroque very {{interesting}} both dramatically and vocally, but {{it is something that}} you need to let go <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> if <b>you</b> want to develop your voice to do a certain [...] "heavier" [...] repertoire. Many Baroque singers only sing Baroque and this is not what I want to do. I enjoyed doing Baroque; addition to the roles named above I did Rinaldo, Cavalli's Ercole Amante, and I did Ariodante but there is a moment when you say [...] "if I want my voice to develop I need to explore other repertoire".|$|R

6000|$|Still Cousin Henry sat silent. He {{was unable}} to summon courage at the instant {{sufficient}} to deny {{the existence of the}} secret, nor could he resolve to take down the book and show the document.

2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Kasavin {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the combat system, arguing, [...] "The combat gets to be repetitive <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Since <b>you</b> only have direct control over one character, who'll mostly depend on the same basic attacks regardless of which weapons you've equipped, the battles don't feel particularly varied {{from one to the}} next." [...] He concluded, [...] "the PlayStation 2 has delivered an almost countless number of high-quality Japanese role-playing games, so all the past competition is really the main reason why Rogue Galaxy doesn't come off as a stunning accomplishment. On the other hand, though, this is a game that does enough differently or better than most of its PS2 predecessors that it's still well deserving of your consideration." ...|$|R

She doesn't care anything for me except as a friend. I never meant to tell her I cared for her but I couldn't help going to Owlwood, even though I knew it was a weakness on my part.
