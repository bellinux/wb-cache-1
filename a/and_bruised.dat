5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, Stone was aboard an {{airplane}} which skidded off a snowy runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; {{there were no}} injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> kidney after crashing his plane in Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes.

5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop fly down the left field line. Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum {{mushrooms}} may {{be confused}} with several edible grey-capped members of the genus Tricholoma, and some authorities recommend leaving all grey-capped Tricholoma mushrooms for experienced hunters. There are several superficially similar European species that could be mistaken for T.pardinum. The smaller T.terreum lacks a mealy smell and cap scales, is darker coloured and less robust, and has smaller spores measuring 5–7.5 by 4–5μm. The edible T.argyraceum somewhat resembles T.pardinum—but with finer scales, and gills <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> parts that yellow with age. Unlike the preferentially montane T.pardinum, these lookalikes tend to fruit at lower elevations. T.atrosquamosum is smaller and darker than T.pardinum, and has a peppery aroma. T.orirubens has fine dark scales and pinkish gills, brittle flesh, and is generally smaller. T.myomyces is smaller than T.pardinum, has a thin, fibrous partial veil on young specimens, and elliptical spores measuring 5–6 by 3.5–4μm. The edible and highly regarded T.portentosum is of a similar size, though has a uniform grey cap that is never scaled.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding <b>and</b> <b>bruised.</b> Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|The England batsmen were {{battered}} <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> to such {{an extent}} that in one game a local player was used to make up an XI. The 41-year-old Colin Cowdrey was sent to reinforce the team on his record sixth tour of Australia and opened the England innings in the second Test at Perth a few days after his arrival and without any match practice. Denness's form deserted him for most of the tour and he became the first captain to drop himself from a Test match, but returned to make 188 and win the Sixth Test by an innings, the highest score by an England captain in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} on 13 February, Jean-Claude Homawoo, {{who was one of}} the UFC's three representatives on CENI, insisted that Olympio was the legitimate UFC candidate because he, unlike Fabre, had been nominated by a party congress in 2008. He also claimed that the UFC was divided between Olympio loyalists and reformists, and he stated that he personally did not support Fabre's candidacy. According to Homawoo, Olympio was not suffering from an illness but rather was recovering from a fall down a flight of stairs, in which he broke his knee <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> his back and neck. Kodjo, speaking on 14 February, also criticized the UFC's decision to withdraw from CENI work as well as the apparent dissension affecting the party leadership.

McCulloch in particular performed monologues that consisted of him, acting as himself, telling hyperbolic stories of the struggles and day to day experiences in his life and/or the lives of others. Prominent examples from the other Kids include Foley describing his positive attitude toward menstruation, McKinney in character as a high-pitched recluse who's describing with intense fascination his hideously infected <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> toe, and in a gag reminiscent of Bob Newhart, a distraught McDonald calling a best friend's young son to tell him his father died, only to have the child end up consoling him, even going so far as quoting famous philosophers on the ultimate emptiness of life.|$|E

25|$|After Booker won, {{he began}} a rivalry with the {{returning}} former champion Batista, who vowed to regain the title {{he was forced to}} forfeit due to injury. This rivalry spilled over to real life when the two got into a legitimate fistfight at a SummerSlam pay-per-view commercial shoot, reportedly due to Batista considering himself superior {{to the rest of the}} roster due to his quick climb to main event status. According to sources, both men were left bloodied <b>and</b> <b>bruised,</b> however Booker was reportedly praised by many wrestlers in the back for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude. At SummerSlam, King Booker lost to Batista by disqualification after Queen Sharmell interfered on his behalf, but at No Mercy, Booker defeated Batista, Lashley and his own stablemate, Finlay, in a Fatal 4-Way match.

25|$|A {{shocking}} {{series of}} incidents {{occurred in the}} locality of Hessilhead, starting on 19 July 1576 when the Lady of Hessilhead slapped one Robert Kent, servant to Gabriel, brother of John Montgomerie. The servant complained to his master and Gabriel went to his brother at the old Thirdpart mansion for advice. John advised him to seek revenge {{and the next morning}} Gabriel and Robert gained entry into Hessilhead Castle where they found the lady alone, upon which they grabbed her by the hair, pulled her onto the floor, kicked her in the bowels, <b>and</b> <b>bruised</b> her shamefully. Gabriel intended to shoot the Laird, however the whole household was now awake and the two only just managed to escape by stealing a horse and locking the castle gate from the outside. The Laird, Hew Montgomerie, hastened to Thirdpart where John and Gabriel came out with pistols and drawn swords and attacked Hew Montgomerie, injuring him on various parts of his body and leaving him for dead. He was rescued by some neighbours who took him to Hessilhead castle where he recovered from his wounds.|$|E
25|$|In late January 1942, the {{squadron}} became operational {{and joined the}} remnants of several others {{that had been in}} Malaya, operating out of RAF Seletar and RAF Kallang. During one of his first sorties, Gorton was involved in a brief dogfight over the South China Sea, after which he suffered engine failure and was forced to land on Bintan island, 40km (25mi) south east of Singapore. As he landed, one of the Hurricane's wheels hit an embankment and flipped over. Gorton was not properly strapped in and his face hit the gun sight and windscreen, mutilating his nose and breaking both cheekbones. He also suffered severe lacerations to both arms. He made {{his way out of the}} wreck and was rescued by members of the Royal Dutch East Indies Army, who provided some medical treatment. Gorton later claimed that his face was so badly cut <b>and</b> <b>bruised,</b> that a member of the RAF sent to collect him assumed he was near death, collected his personal effects and returned to Singapore without him. By chance, one week later, Sgt Matt O'Mara of No. 453 Squadron RAAF also crash landed on Bintan, and arranged for them to be collected.|$|E

40|$|Injection site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> {{are common}} {{side effects of}} {{subcutaneous}} heparin injections. These adverse outcomes are problematic for both {{the patient and the}} nurse. Specifically, site-pain causes the patient discomfort <b>and</b> <b>bruising</b> limits possible sites for subsequent injections. It is important that nurses use an injection technique that minimises the incidence of adverse outcomes when administering subcutaneous heparin injections. This study examines the effect of duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on site-pain intensity <b>and</b> <b>bruise</b> size experienced by a group of patients being treated with heparin for ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. A quasiexperimental design with subjects serving as their own control was used to address the study objectives. The independent variable was the duration of the injection and the dependent variables were site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruise</b> size. A convenience sample of 34 subjects receiving 5000 units of a subcutaneous Fragmin injection twice a day were recruited from a large teaching hospital. Subjects rated the level of perceived site-pain intensity during injection using the vertical Visual Analogue Scale. Injection-site bruising was measured at 48 and 60 hours after injection. Data were analysed using the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test. Results indicated that injection technique B (30 -second injection duration) resulted in significantly less intense site-pain during administering the injection and fewer <b>and</b> smaller <b>bruises.</b> The findings {{of this study indicate that}} injecting subcutaneous heparin over a longer duration may reduce injection site-pain <b>and</b> <b>bruising...</b>|$|R
