500|$|Friedrich {{completed}} {{the first of}} his major paintings in 1807, at the age of 34. The Cross in the Mountains, today known as the Tetschen Altar (Galerie Neue Meister, Dresden), is an altarpiece panel commissioned by the Countess of Thun for her family's chapel in Tetschen, Bohemia. [...] It was {{to be one of the}} few commissions the artist received. The panel depicts a Gipfelkreuz, or a gilded cross, in profile at the top of a mountain, alone, and surrounded by German and <b>Austrian</b> <b>pine</b> trees. The cross reaches the highest point in the picture but is presented obliquely and from a distance. [...] Nature dominates the scene, and for the first time in Christian art, an altarpiece showcases a landscape. According to art historian Linda Siegel, the design of the altarpiece is the [...] "logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in nature's world." ...|$|E

Everything looked like money--like the last coin issued from the Mint. The stables, partly screened by <b>Austrian</b> <b>pines</b> and evergreen oaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as Chapels-of-Ease. On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its door being towards her.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt: During late June {{and early}} July, 1965, it was {{apparent}} that plantations of Scotch and <b>Austrian</b> <b>pines</b> in various Michigan counties were being damaged by lepidopterous larvae mining in the pith of newly developed lateral and terminal branches. Infested samples were examined by Dr. William Wallner, Department of Entomology, Michigan State University, and an attempt was made to rear the extracted larvae. Although as many as two larvae were present in some of the shoots, none survived and no adult moths were secured. A series of larvae was preserved for future study...|$|R

In the middle of the 19th century, the causses around Mende are planted with <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine,</b> this national forest has continued since then. The choice of black pine was due to its ease of acclimation, and its robustness. The presence of this forest often protected Mende from floods.|$|R

50|$|The {{garden was}} {{established}} in 1842 when the city first experimented with plantations of the <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine.</b> By 1861 a botanical garden {{began to take shape}} with species collected from the Julian Alps in Istria and Dalmatia. In 1873 it opened to the public, in 1877 published its first catalog of 254 plants (Delectus seminum quae Hortus Botanicus tergestinus pro mutual communicatione offert), and in 1903 became a public institution attached to the Museum of Natural History. In 1986 the garden was forced to close to the public for lack of resources, but in 2001 part of the garden reopened.|$|R
50|$|Pinus cembra, {{also known}} as Swiss pine, Swiss stone pine or Arolla <b>pine</b> or <b>Austrian</b> stone <b>pine</b> or just Stone pine, is a species of pine tree that grows in the Alps and Carpathian Mountains of central Europe, in Poland (Tatra Mountains), Switzerland, France, Italy, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia (Tatra Mountains), Ukraine and Romania. It {{typically}} grows at 1,200 m to 2,300 m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is typically between 25 m and 35 m in height, and the trunk diameter can be up to 1.5 m. The species is long-lasting and can reach an age between 500 and 1000 years. However, it grows very slowly and it may take 30 years for the tree to reach 1.3 m.|$|R
30|$|In the Southern French Prealps, 65 000 ha {{have been}} planted with <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine</b> (Figure  2) – 15 000 ha in Haute-Provence, 10 000 ha in Drôme and 4000 ha in Hautes-Alpes. These planted {{protection}} forests have effectively maintained their role of controlling erosion {{for more than}} 140 years but their advanced age is now beginning to cause additional problems. These old monoculture forests, with a dominant tree age of approximately 120 years have a structure that is regular and dense (more than 1500 stems ha– 1). Tree heights vary from 12 to 27 m and the average radial growth is equal to 1.16 mm yr– 1. These stands are increasingly prone to large-scale catastrophic phenomena such as wind destruction, fires and parasitic attacks. The uncontrolled and short-term death of these ‘first-generation’ forests could lead to local reactivation of erosion (Rey and Berger, 2006). Moreover, mistletoe (Viscum album L.) has recently appeared on black pine and continues to propagate, accelerating deterioration (Vallauri et al., 2002).|$|R
50|$|Pinus nigra, the <b>Austrian</b> <b>pine</b> {{or black}} pine, is a {{moderately}} variable species of pine, occurring across southern Mediterranean Europe from Spain {{to the eastern}} Mediterranean on Anatolian peninsula of Turkey and on Corsica/Cyprus, including Crimea, and in the high mountains of the Maghreb in North Africa.|$|E

50|$|Saray is 78 km {{north of}} the {{province}} seat Tekirdağ. The land is mostly flat and watered by the River Ergene. At the top north-east corner the land begins {{to rise to the}} Strandzha (Yıldız Dağları) range of hills. 50% of the land is farmed, 50% forest and meadow, including the only stands of <b>Austrian</b> <b>Pine</b> (pinus nigra) in Thrace, a protected area.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} Pinus species, but prefer <b>Austrian</b> and Scotch <b>pine.</b> Young larvae move to {{protected}} sites under bark scales or in crevices below a main lateral branch. Here, they spin a silken chamber. In mid April, after overwintering, the larvae {{feed on the}} bark of their host plant. They mine the inner bark on the main stem and may also feed inside the terminal shoots. It is considered a serious pest of pine species in the mid-west of the United States. Full-grown larvae are 18-25 mm long. They are dirty white to pink or green in colour.|$|R
40|$|We studied soil {{conditions}} and floristic comsposition {{in the forest}} of beech and Hairy Alpenrose (Rhododendro hirsuti-Fagetum) and in the south-Alpine <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine</b> forest (Fraxino orni-Pinetum nigrae) within {{the area of the}} forest fire in Govci (which is located in the northwestern edge of the Trnovski gozd plateau, western Slovenia) and compared them with conditions in preserved beech and black pine forests five years after the wildfire. The black pine forest overgrows Lithosols and Moder Rendzinas. In the beech forest beside these soils, more-developed Mull Rendzinas and Brown Rendzinas have evolved as well. On the scene of forest fire fertility, thickness and areal shares of soils were greatly reduced and surface stoniness with rockiness proved to be increased. Vegetation of the burnt forests differs from preserved forests mostly in the abundant appearance of some species characteristic for forest clearings and burnt sites (class Epilobietea angustifolii). In the moss layer species Ceratodon purpureus, Polytrichum juniperinum and Marchantia polymorpha are typical for places of the fire (the last two especially for the burnt beech forest) ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1934 the Bradleys hired Carl Urban, {{a fourth}} {{generation}} gardener, {{to supervise the}} crew and the planting of the garden beds and trees. Trained in Germany and the United States, Urban observed that {{when he first saw}} the acreage behind the house it consisted mainly of corn fields with horses, sheep, goats and 13 oak trees. Over time, nearly 4,000 trees were planted on the property—several varieties of elms as well as Norwegian, <b>Austrian</b> and Scotch <b>pines,</b> Norway maples, a Danish plum tree, seven varieties of birch trees and Kentucky coffee trees. Urban remained on the staff and resided in the apartment in the barn until his death in 1991.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} {{some species}} of birds are considered pests by Christmas tree farmers, examples include the pine grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator) and the yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphrapicus varius). The pine grosbeak feeds on buds on conifers, including Christmas trees, which stunts tree growth, causes abnormal formation, and thins the foliage. The pine grosbeak, as a pest, generally affects Scots pine but also affects eastern white and red pine as well as spruce trees. The yellow-bellied sapsucker, as a Christmas tree pest, is hosted by Scots and <b>Austrian</b> <b>pine</b> trees. The sapsuckers peck holes in sapling bark causing sap to bleed out: potentially killing the trees and allowing insects and pathogens to enter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Stand Density Control Diagram (SDCD) is {{an average}} stand-level model which is {{primarily}} used to derive density control schedules by management objective. One of its applications is to evaluate stand growth parameters {{at any time}} of stand development. The main objective of the present investigation is to examine a model of SDCD estimated for <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra Arn.) plantations in Bulgaria with a representative validation data set and to illustrate its application for estimation of density, mean breast height diameter and stand stock. Equivalent mean diameter curves proved to be very good predictors for all studied growth parameters, having smaller relative errors than the Equivalent height curves. A result of practical importance is the insignificant difference between the direct (experimental dominant height) and the indirect (predicted dominant height) way of parameter estimation. Among all six examined ways of determination of the stand stock the Equivalent mean diameter curves based on the experimental values of basal area and dominant height showed best performance. The proposed model of SDCD avoids some disadvantages of the existing growth and yield models and supplies a reliable method for estimation of the stand growth parameters...|$|R
40|$|Context : Forest stand {{dynamics}} models {{simulate the}} growth of trees in stands; based on field measurements and system knowledge, they provide a relatively precise representation of forest growth and are well adapted for forest management purposes. Architectural models describe the structure of plants according to ontogenetic development processes; as a support of biomass production and partitioning at organ scale, they simulate individual tree development. Aims :The {{aim of this study}} was to link a stand dynamics model and an architectural model to simulate stand dynamics, in which the ecological or silvicultural modelling from the stand model and the architecture representation could be integrated, to provide individual tree details at the stand level. Methods : Stand-level simulations of <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine</b> dynamics provided global results on tree growth from the empirical forest growth model PNN, and branching details for individual trees were provided by the functional–structural plant model (FSPM) GreenLab. Results : Individual tree dynamics were computed, and the simulated trees were integrated at the stand level for visualizing two different management scenarios. Conclusion : By combining a stand dynamics model adapted to forest management with an FSPM with detailed tree architecture, it is possible to simulate individual tree structure with consistent dimensions, adapted to ecological and silvicultural modelling for decision support in forest management...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} three plots (20 × 50 m) {{established}} in even-aged Pinus nigra (<b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine)</b> stands located at approximately the same altitude, characterised by a similar age but showing different growth rate. Spatial distribution of natural regeneration (NR) were examined for each species by calculating Ripley’s K and Moran index and by analysing their age- and size structure. Although the species mixture of NR differed among the plots, Abies alba was always the most frequent. Results showed that the clumped distribution of NR prevails over the random one. The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated at least two modes of space colonisation in line with clumped distribution of NR. In the first, the seedlings occupy different micro-areas in different times, whereas in the second the colonisation process occurs in the same micro-area for a more extended time. The resulting structure of NR is constituted by several small patches of different age in the first case or by patches with a similar uneven-aged structure in the second. These different colonisation patterns could be ascribed respectively to short-term disturbances such as sudden opening in the canopy and litter removal in the first case and to longterm disturbances or the presence of scarcely modifiable environmental factors such as soil characteristics and micro-morphology in the second. However, the colonisation process was always temporally limited. Age structures of the different species overlapped and were not related to stand basal area. As both colonisation patterns are likely to increase the structural and floristic complexity of the future stands, our data further confirm the important role played by Pinus nigra in recovering degraded lands.

Creeping willow curls {{in the shape of}} a rose called the [...] "Skagen rose". Not a flower, it is dried and used to decorate souvenirs. The dune plantation was established in 1888 to the south of Skagen, and developed on both sides of the road that runs between Frederikshavn and Skagen, in order to stop the sand dunes from moving. It also facilitated better fishing catches. To the south, plantations (some even 100 years old) feature trees, including pines (mountain pine, <b>Austrian</b> <b>pine,</b> Scots pine and contorta), spruce, oak, birch in patches, as well as reindeer moss. These cultivated forests are also recreational areas, with well laid-out walkways. Here, the forest floor is spread with anemones, corydalis, scented honeysuckle and moss.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{settlement}} is Postojna, {{located at the}} entrance to the Postojna Gate, and on the opposite side lies Razdrto, which played a key role in transportation in the past. The Upper Pivka Basin and its upper margins, closing the basin from all sides, consists of Cretaceous limestone. The large karst field has a level bottom that is often flooded, traversed by the Pivka River, along which there is a higher level terrace with numerous sinkholes and larger basins with flat bottoms. When the level of karst water, which is always close below the surface, rises, the Pivka starts to flood near Zagorje. Floods occur along the Pivka, and the Pivka Lakes in depressions, among which the largest are Lake Palčje, Lake Petelinje, Lake Parje, and Lake Drskovče. The bottom of the Upper Pivka Basin is covered by a thin layer of eluvium. Higher-elevation parts have thin soil, suitable only for pasturing sheep or goats. The slopes are mostly covered by forest, primarily intentionally planted <b>Austrian</b> <b>pine,</b> spruce, and larch. The settlements in the Upper Pivka Basin are most dense along the western side of the basin. They lie next to flat basins filled with more recent deposits between Pivka and Šembije in the south, next to more open fields in the broader part of the basin between Pivka and Rakitnik in the north, and next to more or less extensive uvalas of the border part of the basin. The employment and supply centre of the Upper Pivka Basin is Pivka. The development of Pivka was most influenced by its location between two administrative, economic, and cultural areas. Despite their important transport location, the settlements in the Pivka Basin have not significantly developed. This is still only an area people pass through. The most important economic activities are forestry, wood processing and food processing, transport, tourism, livestock and poultry, and more recently sheep farming.|$|E
30|$|As {{outlined}} above, erosion problems {{appeared in}} the Southern Prealps of France during the Little Ice Age, due to the combination of climate change and poor agricultural practices (Neboit, 1991; Vallauri et al., 2002). The first written reports that pointed out the linkage between deforestation and erosion in the mountains dated {{back to the early}} 19 th century (Dugied, 1819; Surell, 1841), but the French administration did not start to take erosion into consideration until the first strategic transport infrastructures were established in the mountains (see Mather et al. (1999) for an historical and socio-political account). The Code Forestier of 1827 provided the basis for developing how forests were to be managed, though made only modest provision for reforesting. The political decision to engage an ambitious programme of reforestation in the Alps was made in 1860, with the promulgation of the first law for the reforestation of mountains – the Restauration des terrains en Montagne (RTM) Act. This political process was clearly accelerated by the catastrophic flood of May–June 1856 in the Rhône River, which had a strong influence on policymakers (Bravard, 2002). This extreme flood had dramatic consequences, notably at Lyon, with several hundreds of houses destroyed and 18 persons killed. Two other laws were passed in 1864 and 1882 to improve and complete the legislative case for erosion control in the mountains. The erosion-control programme lasted 50 years, from the 1860 s to the First World War. Degraded lands were purchased by the State to implement reforestation and torrent-control engineering works. About 65 000 ha were successfully reforested during this period (Blanchard, 1945). By the end of the 19 th century, most of the degraded marly terrain in the Southern Alps in France had been afforested, primarily with <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold ssp, nigra) (Vallauri et al., 2002) in order to control erosion and torrential floods.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{investigated}} the emissions, including odor, from log wood stoves, burning wood types indigenous to mid-European {{countries such as}} Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Switzerland, as well as Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria (Germany) and South Tyrol (Italy). The investigations were performed with a modern, certified, 8 kW, manually fired log wood stove, {{and the results were}} compared to emissions from a modern 9 kW pellet stove. The examined wood types were deciduous species: black locust, black poplar, European hornbeam, European beech, pedunculate oak (also known as “common oak”), sessile oak, turkey oak and conifers: <b>Austrian</b> black <b>pine,</b> European larch, Norway spruce, Scots pine, silver fir, as well as hardwood briquettes. In addition, “garden biomass” such as pine cones, pine needles and dry leaves were burnt in the log wood stove. The pellet stove was fired with softwood pellets. The composite average emission rates for log wood and briquettes were 2030 mgMJ− 1 for CO; 89 mgMJ− 1 for NOx, 311 mgMJ− 1 for CxHy, 67 mgMJ− 1 for particulate matter PM 10 and average odor concentration was at 2430 OUm− 3. CO, CxHy and PM 10 emissions from pellets combustion were lower by factors of 10, 13 and 3, while considering NOx – comparable to the log wood emissions. Odor from pellets combustion was not detectable. CxHy and PM 10 emissions from garden biomass (needles and leaves) burning were 10 times higher than for log wood, while CO and NOx rise only slightly. Odor levels ranged from not detectable (pellets) to around 19, 000 OUm− 3 (dry leaves). The odor concentration correlated with CO, CxHy and PM 10. For log wood combustion average odor ranged from 536 OUm− 3 for hornbeam to 5217 OUm− 3 for fir, indicating a considerable influence of the wood type on odor concentration...|$|R
50|$|Cyclaneusma (Needle cast) {{primarily}} attacks Scots <b>Pines.</b> <b>Austrian</b> white, Eastern white, and Ponderosa pines {{are also}} among the infected. Young Scots Pines have been infected in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas in the US. There have also been many incidents in New Zealand. Cyclaneusma has been seen on Ponderosa pines in North Dakota and Nebraska. During early autumn, needles within {{the interior of the}} infected tree begin to develop yellow spots. As the fall progresses and the temperature drops, the infected needles become darker while brown horizontal bands appear on the needles’ surface. From October until about May, off-white fruiting bodies called pseudothecia appear on the yellow needles. This is a macroscopic sign as the fruiting bodies swell with moisture making them visible to the naked eye. The yellowing of needles that occurs in early September actually leads to premature - or the first detection of - needle-cast which causes a stunted growth. In fact, the most infected needles prematurely shed by December. Because the infected needles are within the interior of the tree, the newer needles on the outer surface of the pines are flushed green and resistant to the disease. However, the premature shedding of needles in the interior can extend outwards leading to a loss in overall growth. The distribution of Cyclaneusma is not uniform but scattered with symptomatic and unaffected trees in close proximity with one another.|$|R
