500|$|Although Constantine's death {{follows the}} {{conclusion}} of the Persian campaign in Eusebius's account, most other sources report his death as occurring in its middle. Emperor Julian (a nephew of Constantine), writing in the mid-350s, observes that the Sassanians escaped punishment for their ill-deeds, because Constantine died [...] "in the middle of his preparations for war". Similar accounts are given in the Origo Constantini, an <b>anonymous</b> <b>document</b> composed while Constantine was still living, and which has Constantine dying in Nicomedia; the Historiae abbreviatae of Sextus Aurelius Victor, written in 361, which has Constantine dying at an estate near Nicomedia called Achyrona while marching against the Persians; and the Breviarium of Eutropius, a handbook compiled in 369 for the Emperor Valens, which has Constantine dying in a nameless state villa in Nicomedia. From these and other accounts, some have concluded that Eusebius's Vita was edited to defend Constantine's reputation against what Eusebius saw as a less congenial version of the campaign.|$|E

500|$|Hans Hendricksz Bouwer was {{the first}} to list [...] "dodos", most likely {{referring}} to the Rodrigues solitaire, as part of the fauna of Rodrigues in 1601. Sir Thomas Herbert mentioned [...] "dodos" [...] on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also mentioned in 1700. The next account, which {{was the first}} referring to the bird as the [...] "solitaire", was published in François Leguat's 1708 memoir, A New Voyage to the East Indies. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees, who were the first to colonise the island from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. His description of the Rodrigues solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, and he also described other species that are now extinct. Leguat's observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe dodos there. The Huguenots praised the Rodrigues solitaires for their flavour, especially that of the young, and used their gizzard stones as knife sharpeners. D'Héguerty later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as bezoars. The second most detailed description of the bird was found in an <b>anonymous</b> <b>document</b> rediscovered in 1874 called Relation de l'Ile Rodrigue, which has been attributed to Julien Tafforet, a mariner marooned on Rodrigues in 1726. His observations are considered credible, though it is known he had a copy of Leguat's memoirs with him during his stay.|$|E
2500|$|Pliny {{gives an}} account of how the trials are {{conducted}} and the various verdicts (sections 4-6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, {{for a total of}} three times, threatening them with death if they continue to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he has no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (obstinatio) and stubbornness, (pertinacia) deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult. [...] Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published <b>anonymous</b> <b>document</b> and not by Pliny nor the empire.|$|E

40|$|Renaissance theatre, both in England and Italy, was a {{commercial}} enterprise and, therefore, it utilized procedures of {{division of labour}} {{to meet the challenge}} of the market. One of these procedures was the compilation of preparatory texts of various kinds. But, while about one thousand scenari of the commedia dell’arte (some anonymous, some with the author’s name) survive, of the ‘plots’ compiled by the English ‘plotters’ in preparation of plays to be written only one incomplete specimen and a few fragments have been preserved; their nature, therefore, remains dubious. Furthermore, <b>anonymous</b> <b>documents</b> of a different nature, also confusingly called ‘plots’, but compiled as reminders for the actors’ entrances during performance, have survived in six, mostly fragmentary, manuscripts. This article discusses these three kinds of preparatory texts in order to characterize their different nature and argues that, although suggestive, the idea of a derivation of the two kinds of English ‘plots’ from the scenari appears unconvincing; indeed, the compilation, in both contexts, of preparatory texts was simply an obvious and necessary measure in order to speed up procedures...|$|R

Its beak is a little like that of a curlew, excepting that it is slightly thicker and not quite so long. It plumage is spotted with white and grey. They generally feed on the eggs of the land tortoises, which they find in the ground, which makes them so fat that they often have difficulty running. They are very good to eat, and their fat is of a yellowish red, which is excellent for pains. They have small pinions wings, without feathers, on which account they cannot fly; but on the other hand, they run very well. Their cry is a continual whistling.

5000|$|Historically, the Mattapoisett River {{has yielded}} the bay's most {{abundant}} herring populations. For example, town reports for 1906 recorded that the river's total catch was 626,000 alewives, and a further 465,000 alewives were {{noted in the}} 1907 report. In the referenced 1920's report the river served for [...] "flooding cranberry bogs and for mill purposes" [...] and featured three herring weirs; the [...] "Upper Herring Weir" [...] in Rochester, the [...] "Middle Weir" [...] or [...] "Church's Weir", and the [...] "Lower Herring Weir" [...] {{at the entrance to}} Mattapoisett Harbor.Fish populations drastically declined during the twentieth century until they were almost extinguished, but local restoration efforts from the 1980s onwards have fostered a slow recovery.

Reports from Alewives <b>Anonymous</b> <b>documented</b> in the more recent Buzzards Bay National Estuary Program report show that the improvements peaked in 2000 with over 130,000, but dropped off again and have been below 20,000 since 2003.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{provides}} an ideal anonymous channel for concealing computer-mediated malicious activities, as the network-based origins of critical electronic textual evidence (e. g., emails, blogs, forum posts, chat log etc.) {{can be easily}} repudiated. Authorship attribution {{is the study of}} identifying the actual author of the given <b>anonymous</b> <b>documents</b> based on the text itself, and, for decades, many linguistic stylometry and computational techniques have been extensively studied for this purpose. However, most of the previous research emphasizes promoting the authorship attribution accuracy and few works have been done for the purpose of constructing and visualizing the evidential traits; also, these sophisticated techniques are difficult for cyber investigators or linguistic experts to interpret. In this thesis, based on the EEDI (End-to-End Digital Investigation) Framework we propose a visualizable evidence-driven approach, namely VEA, which aims at facilitating the work of cyber investigation. Our comprehensive controlled experiment and stratified experiment on the real-life Enron email data set both demonstrate that our approach can achieve even higher accuracy than traditional methods; meanwhile, its output can be easily visualized and interpreted as evidential traits. In addition to identifying the most plausible author of a given text, our approach also estimates the confidence for the predicted result based on a given identification context and presents visualizable linguistic evidence for each candidate. ...|$|R
