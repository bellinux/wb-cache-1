5|$|After the <b>accidental</b> <b>release,</b> another {{radiological}} survey was performed, {{and the state}} government concluded that PermaGrain needed to be relocated. The DCNR made the policy decision that Quehanna Wild Area would be closed to industrial uses. After looking at multiple sites with Clearfield County development authorities, a new site for PermaGrain Products was purchased, and the company submitted its {{plans for a new}} building and license to the NRC in October 2001. In order to approve the move to the new site, the NRC required PermaGrain to provide an inventory of all their cobalt-60 sources, dispose of a damaged source, and dispose of any other sources not mechanically certified. However in late December 2002, PermaGrain filed for bankruptcy under Chapter Seven. PermaGrain had employed 135 people in 1988 and 80 in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an <b>accidental</b> <b>release</b> of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong.|$|E

40|$|Considerable cross-disciplinary {{efforts are}} {{currently}} addressing the likely consequences of <b>accidental</b> <b>releases</b> from pressurised CO 2 pipelines {{to be used}} in carbon capture and storage applications. Accurate prediction of discharge rate, condensed phase and the subsequent atmospheric dispersion of CO 2 from such <b>accidental</b> <b>releases</b> is necessary to quantify all the hazard consequences, and forms the basis for emergency response planning and in determining minimum safe distances to populated areas. Pivotal to obtaining accurate predictions from numerical simulations is the correct choice of an equation of state. In this paper, we present a novel composite equation of state method implemented into a RANS model, with the equation set closed by a compressibility-corrected k- turbulence model. We demonstrate the improved performance of the new composite method over ideal and Peng-Robinson equations of state, and attribute the improvements to the accurate treatment of condensed phase CO 2, present in such <b>accidental</b> <b>releases...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Africanized {{honey bees}} in the Western Hemisphere are descended from hives {{operated}} by biologist Warwick E. Kerr, who had interbred honey bees from Europe and southern Africa. Kerr {{was attempting to}} breed a strain of bees that would produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions (i.e., more productive) than the European strain of honey bee currently in use throughout North, Central and South America. The hives containing this particular Africanized subspecies, were housed at an apiary near Rio Claro, São Paulo, in the southeast of Brazil and were noted to be especially defensive. These hives had been fitted with special excluder screens (called queen excluders) to prevent the larger queen bees and drones from getting out and mating with the local population of European bees. According to Kerr, in October 1957 a visiting beekeeper, noticing that the queen excluders were interfering with the worker bees' movement, removed them resulting in the <b>accidental</b> <b>release</b> of 26 Tanganyikan swarms of A. m. scutellata. Following this <b>accidental</b> <b>release,</b> the Africanized swarms spread out and cross-bred with local European colonies; their descendants have since spread throughout the Americas. Because their movement through South and Central America was rapid and largely unassisted by humans, Africanized bees have earned {{the reputation of being}} {{one of the most successful}} biologically invasive species of all time.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, it was {{reported}} that the Trent was cleaner {{than it had been in}} the last 70–80 years, and that episodic incidents of pollution had also reduced considerably since the 1970s. The river remains vulnerable to these pollution events, such as the one that occurred in October 2009 when an <b>accidental</b> <b>release</b> of cyanide from a factory into the sewer system in Stoke-on-Trent, affected the treatment works at Strongford. This resulted in the release of raw sewage and the chemical into the river, killing thousands of fish, and posing a health risk to river users as far south as Burton.|$|E
25|$|Ozone (3) is {{generated}} by passing oxygen (2) through a high voltage potential resulting in a third oxygen atom becoming attached and forming 3. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone {{is considered to be}} safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous {{in the event of an}} <b>accidental</b> <b>release),</b> ozone {{is generated}} on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.|$|E

25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down on-off valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to <b>accidental</b> <b>release</b> of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E
25|$|In December 1944 it {{was decided}} to deploy Bibers against traffic to Antwerp in the Scheldt Estuary. The force was based at Rotterdam with forward bases at Poortershaven and Hellevoetsluis. The first attack took place {{on the night of the}} 22/23 of December. Eighteen Biber were {{involved}} of which only one returned. The only allied loss caused by the operation was Alan A. Dale. Further operations between the 23rd and the 25th achieved no success and none of the 14 submarines deployed survived. On the 27th the <b>accidental</b> <b>release</b> of a torpedo in the Voorneschen resulted in the sinking of 11 Bibers (although they were later recovered). The three undamaged Bibers later sailed again; none returned. An operation on the night 29/30 January resulted in damage to (much of it due to ice) or loss of most of the remaining Bibers. Losses combined with RAF bombing prevented attacks from being mounted in February 1945. The bombing had damaged the cranes used to move the Bibers into and out of the water. Reinforcements allowed operations to continue until April 1945 but no successes were achieved and the Biber flotillas continued to take a very high rate of losses. The last Biber mission was an attempt at mine laying and took place on the night of 26 April. Of the four Bibers that took part, one ran aground and three were attacked by Thunderbolts, which sank two of them.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The principal role of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is to investigate <b>accidental</b> <b>releases</b> of regulated or extremely hazardous substances to determine the conditions and circumstances {{that led to the}} accident and to identify the cause or causes so that similar accidents might be prevented. <b>Accidental</b> <b>releases</b> of these toxic and hazardous chemicals occur frequently and often have serious consequences. CSB reported to Congress that the agency received notification of approximately 900 chemical accidents in calendar year 2007, and that 31 of these accidents were serious or even fatal events that warranted the commitment of CSB investigators. CSB began operating in 1998 as an independent agency created under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The act directs CSB to (1) investigate and report on the cause or probable cause of any <b>accidental</b> chemical <b>releases</b> from stationary sources resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damages; (2) make recommendations to reduce the likelihood or consequences of <b>accidental</b> chemical <b>releases</b> and propose corrective measures; and (3) establish regulations for reporting <b>accidental</b> <b>releases.</b> The agency publishes investigative reports and issues safety studies and videos to help prevent future accidents. Congress modeled CSB after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which has a similar public safety mission. Like NTSB, CSB has no enforcement authority and a limited regulatory role. As outlined in the authorizing statute, CSB is to be managed by a five-member board. Currently the board has one vacancy.
