The initial <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> {{was reported to be}} US 4.43 cents per kWh (USD 0.0443/kWh) although, because of high coal prices, it was reported that the PLN would adjust the purchase price upwards to US 5.2 cents per kWh (USD 0.052/kWh).|$|R
50|$|By Mid June 1872 the Mineral Loop was {{extended}} from Drybrook Road {{to join the}} existing line at Wimberry but in February 1873 the junction at Bilson was still awaited. In fact commissioning of the junction at Bilson Bilson was delayed until 15 September 1873, and the through east-west iron ore traffic which had been foreseen was not started until November 1875, probably due to difficulty in <b>agreeing</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

50|$|The rate of {{demurrage}} (if any) {{is generally}} accepted as {{the measure of the}} damages for detention, but is not necessarily the true measure. When the claim is for detention and not demurrage the actual loss is recoverable, which may be more or may be less than the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> of demurrage. The contract usually doesn't count Sundays and holidays as lay days—but unless expressly stipulated, this exception does not apply after the lay days have expired.|$|R
50|$|An {{overdraft}} {{occurs when}} withdrawals {{from a bank}} account exceed the available balance. This gives the account a negative balance and in effect means the account provider is providing credit. If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft facility, and the amount overdrawn is within this authorised overdraft, then interest is normally charged at the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> If the balance exceeds the agreed facility then fees may be charged and a higher interest rate might apply.|$|R
5000|$|An {{overdraft}} {{occurs when}} money is withdrawn {{from a bank}} account and the available balance goes below zero. In this situation the account {{is said to be}} [...] "overdrawn". If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then interest is normally charged at the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> If the negative balance exceeds the agreed terms, then additional fees may be charged and higher interest rates may apply.|$|R

50|$|After {{purchasing}} an asset, {{the owner}} enters a long-term agreement {{by which the}} property is leased back to the seller at an <b>agreed</b> <b>rate.</b> One reason for a leaseback is to transfer ownership to a holding company while keeping proper track of the ongoing worth and profitability of the asset. Another reason is for the seller to raise money by offloading a valuable asset to a buyer who is presumably interested in making a long-term secured investment. Leaseback arrangements are common in the REIT industry.|$|R

Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, pension plans and other large investment portfolios.|$|R
50|$|Demurrage is a {{fixed sum}} per day or per hour that the {{charterer}} agrees {{to pay for}} any time that the vessel is detained for loading or discharging over the time contractually allowed—usually described as lay days. Sometimes {{the number of days}} the vessel may be kept on demurrage at the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> is fixed by the charter-party. If no demurrage is provided for by the charter-party, and the vessel is not loading or discharging beyond the lay days, the shipowner can claim damages for the loss suffered by the detention of the ship.|$|R

50|$|A swap {{agreement}} {{in which one}} party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In partial return reverse swaps, the underlying asset, {{referred to as the}} reference asset, is usually a stock or portfolio of stocks. The reference asset is sold to the buyer, with half (or some other percentage) of the return owned by the party receiving the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> of payment, which is usually {{in the form of a}} note payable.|$|R

50|$|India has {{comprehensive}} Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) with 88 countries. This {{means that}} there are <b>agreed</b> <b>rates</b> of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed DTAA, while Section 91 provides relief to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed a DTAA. Thus, India gives relief to both kind of taxpayers.|$|R
40|$|Minimum {{wages in}} Sweden are collectively agreed and differ by industry. Within agreements, the rates are also highly differentiated. Minimum wages are higher in Sweden {{than in any}} of the {{countries}} with statutory rates considered in this study. This is line with the view that minimum wages are higher than otherwise when unions are involved in minimum wage setting. The reported results for Sweden do no support the suggestion that adverse employment effects are modest in systems with collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>rates.</b> This runs counter to the hypothesis that unions and employers have a good sense of what constitutes a relevant market wage for unskilled workers and use this information to set minimum wages at appropriate levels.

40|$|Abstract Background In earlier work, {{we found}} {{important}} selection biases {{when we tried}} to obtain consent for participation in a national stroke registry. Recognizing that not all registries will be exempt from requiring consent for participation, we examine here in greater depth the reasons for the poor accrual of patients from a systems perspective with a view to obtaining as representative sample as possible. Methods We determined the percent of eligible patients who were approached to participate and, among those approached, the percent who actually consented to participate. In addition we examined the reasons why people were not approached or did not consent and the variation across sites in the percent of patients approached and consented. We also considered site variation in restrictions on the accrual and data collection process imposed by either the local research ethics board or the hospital. Results Seventy percent of stroke patients were approached, with wide variations in approach rates across sites (from: 41 % to 86 %), and considerable inter-site variation in hospital policies governing patient accrual. Chief reasons for not approaching were discharge or death before being approached for consent. Seventeen percent of those approached refused to participate (range: 5 % to 75 %). Finally, 11 % of those approached did not participate due to language or communication difficulties. Conclusion We found wide variation in approach and <b>agree</b> <b>rates</b> across sites that were accounted for, in part, by different approaches to accrual and idiosyncratic policies of the hospitals. This wide variation in approach and <b>agree</b> <b>rates</b> raises important challenges for research ethics boards and data protection authorities in determining when to waive consent requirements, when to press for increased quality control, when to permit local adaptation of the consent process, and when to permit alternatives to individual express consent. We offer several suggestions for those registries that require consent for participation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Retail {{electrical}} power marketers, {{also known as}} retailers, typically set up contracts with suppliers to secure electricity at fixed prices {{on the one hand}} and with end users to meet their load requirements at <b>agreed</b> <b>rates</b> on the other hand. Also high penetration of distributed generation (DG) resource is increasingly observed worldwide. Considering the viewpoint of a retailer, this paper analyzes the problem of setting up contracts on both the supplier and end-user sides to maximize profits while maintaining a minimum operational cost of distribution system. The proposed two-level optimization models can minimize the cost of distribution system with Distributed Generation and maximize the profits of retailers. The numerical simulations are carried out based on an IEEE 33 -bus test distribution network. Test results are included to show the performance of the proposed method...|$|R

The five members of the London Bullion Association: Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank, Scotiabank, HSBC and Société Générale, now conduct their twice-daily meetings over the telephone.

5000|$|When {{presented}} {{with the problem of}} speculators shifting operations to offshore tax havens, a representative of a [...] "pro-Tobin tax" [...] NGO argued as follows: Agreement between nations could help avoid the relocation threat, particularly if the tax were charged at the site where dealers or banks are physically located or at the sites where payments are settled or 'netted'. The relocation of Chase Manhattan Bank to an offshore site would be expensive, risky and highly unlikely - particularly to avoid a small tax. Globally, the move towards a centralized trading system means transactions are being tracked by fewer and fewer institutions. Hiding trades is becoming increasingly difficult. Transfers to tax havens like the Cayman Islands could be penalized at double the <b>agreed</b> <b>rate</b> or more. Citizens of participating countries would also be taxed regardless of where the transaction was carried out.|$|R
