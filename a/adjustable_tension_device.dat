40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} confer optimal {{strength}} and stiffness to the graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, {{the maintenance of}} equal strand tension prior to fixation, is desired; positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can significantly affect strand tension This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> mal-positioning on individual strand tension in simulated cadaveric ACL reconstructions. Methods Twenty cadaveric specimens, comprising bovine tibia and tendon harvested from sheep, were used to simulate ACL reconstruction with a looped four-strand tendon graft. A proprietary <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was used to tension the graft during tibial component fixation with graft tension recorded using load cells. The effects of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> at extreme angles, and in various locking states, was evaluated. Results Strand tension varied significantly when the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was held at extreme angles (p Conclusion An even distribution of tension among individual graft strands is obtained by maintaining the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in an unlocked state, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tibial tunnel. If the maintenance of equal strand tension during tibial fixation of grafts is important, close attention must be paid to positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in order to optimize the resultant graft tension and, by implication, the strength and stiffness of the graft and ultimately, surgical outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> is {{designed}} to pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the spring type balancer. The spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> for Shinkansen, making effective use of the spring type balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained.

50|$|A dynamic {{compression}} plate (DCP) is a metallic plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> to a plate or by using a special {{dynamic compression}} plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|R

40|$|AIMS: Previous {{studies using}} {{isolated}} strips of human detrusor muscle identified <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>tension,</b> a novel mechanism that acutely regulates detrusor wall tension. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to develop a method to identify a correlate measure of <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>tension</b> during urodynamics. METHODS: Patients reporting urgency most or all of the time based on ICIq-OAB survey scores were prospectively enrolled in an extended repeat fill-and-empty urodynamics study designed to identify a correlate of <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>tension</b> which we now call dynamic elasticity. Cystometric capacity was determined during initial fill. Repeat fills to defined percentages of capacity with passive emptying (via syringe aspiration) were performed to strain soften the bladder. A complete fill with active voiding was included to determine whether human bladder exhibits reversible strain softening. RESULTS: Five patients completed the extended urodynamics study. Intravesical pressure (p(ves)) decreased with subsequent fills and was significantly lower during Fill 3 compared to Fill 1 (P= 0. 008), demonstrating strain softening. Active voiding after Fill 3 caused strain softening reversal, with p(ves) in Fill 4 returning to the baseline measured during Fill 1 (P= 0. 29). Dynamic elasticity, the urodynamic correlate of <b>adjustable</b> preload <b>tension,</b> was calculated as the amount of strain softening (or its reversal) per %capacity (average p(ves) between fills/%capacity). Dynamic elasticity was lost via repeat passive filling and emptying (strain softening) and regained after active voiding regulated the process (strain softening reversal). CONCLUSIONS: Improved understanding of dynamic elasticity in the human bladder could lead to both improved sub-typing and novel treatments of overactive bladder...|$|R
