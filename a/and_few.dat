5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods <b>and</b> <b>few</b> polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes <b>and</b> <b>few</b> amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{lasted until}} 1753 and {{involved}} many of London's periodicals.

5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, <b>and</b> <b>few</b> artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E

Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns intended to prevent Lassa fever. With little funding <b>and</b> <b>few</b> supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, <b>and</b> <b>few</b> produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E
