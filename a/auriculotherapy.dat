25|$|<b>Auriculotherapy,</b> {{commonly}} known as ear acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, or auriculoacupuncture, is considered to date back to ancient China. It involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the outer ear. The modern approach was developed in France during the early 1950s. There is no scientific evidence that it can cure disease; the evidence of effectiveness is negligible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Auriculotherapy</b> (also {{auricular}} therapy, ear acupuncture, and auriculoacupuncture) {{is a form}} {{of alternative}} medicine {{based on the idea that}} the ear is a microsystem, which reflects the entire body, represented on the auricle, the outer portion of the ear. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient are assumed to be treatable by stimulation of the surface of the ear exclusively. Similar mappings are used in many areas of the body, including the practices of reflexology and iridology. These mappings are not based on or supported by any medical or scientific evidence.|$|E
50|$|<b>Auriculotherapy</b> was {{proposed}} in the “Treatise of Auriculotherapy” (1957), by the neurologist Paul Nogier. The developments were made by clinical trials based upon a phrenological method of projection of a fetal Homunculus on the ear, for reference of physical complaints and points for medical treatment. Nogier soon presented his discovery to the public, where members of the Chinese Army picked up the map {{and took it to}} the barefoot doctors of China, farmers with minimal training in basic medical and in paramedical skills, and so provide medical services in rural China.|$|E

METHOD This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial with preliminary data. Thirty pregnant women with gestational age ≥ 37 weeks, cervical dilatation ≥ 4 cm and two or more contractions in 10 minutes were selected and randomly divided into three groups: <b>auriculotherapy,</b> placebo and control. <b>Auriculotherapy</b> was applied using crystal beads on four strategic points. RESULTS No statistical significance {{was found between the}} groups with regard to pain; however, the women from the <b>auriculotherapy</b> group had lower intensity and less perception of pain at 30, 60 and 120 minutes of treatment. The average duration of labour was shorter in the <b>auriculotherapy</b> group (248. 7 versus placebo 414. 8 versus control 296. 3 minutes); caesarean section rates were higher in the placebo group (50 %) and the same in the other groups (10 %).

40|$|Objectives: Side-effects of {{standard}} pain medications can limit their use. Therefore, nonpharmacologic pain relief {{techniques such as}} <b>auriculotherapy</b> may {{play an important role}} in pain management. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating <b>auriculotherapy</b> for pain management. Design: MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane Library were searched through December 2008. Randomized trials comparing <b>auriculotherapy</b> to sham, placebo, or standard-of-care control were included that measured outcomes of pain or medication use and were published in English. Two (2) reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility, quality, and abstracted data to a standardized form. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated for studies using a pain score or analgesic requirement as a primary outcome. Results: Seventeen (17) studies met inclusion criteria (8 perioperative, 4 acute, and 5 chronic pain). Aur-iculotherapy was superior to controls for studies evaluating pain intensity (SMD, 1. 56 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 85, 2. 26]; 8 studies). For perioperative pain, <b>auriculotherapy</b> reduced analgesic use (SMD, 0. 54 [95 % CI: 0. 30, 0. 77]; 5 studies). For acute pain and chronic pain, <b>auriculotherapy</b> reduced pain intensity (SMD for acute pain, 1. 35 [95 % CI: 0. 08, 2. 64], 2 studies; SMD for chronic pain, 1. 84 [95 % CI: 0. 60, 3. 07], 5 studies). Removal of poor quality studies did not alter the conclusions. Significant heterogeneity existed among studies of acute and chronic pain, but not perioperative pain. Conclusions: <b>Auriculotherapy</b> may be effective for the treatment of a variety of types of pain, especially post-operative pain. However, a more accurate estimate of the effect will require further large, well-designed trials...|$|E

40|$|Dear editor We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the excellent review on xerostomia induced by radio-therapy, by Pinna et al. 1 The authors should be congratulated for a very detailed review of the physiopathology, clinical symptoms, and therapeutic management of an extremely difficult condition. Although we agree {{that the use of}} anticholinergic medication represents a treatment, it requires the patient to have residual salivary gland function. Unfortunately, it is well established that in most cases radiotherapy destroys most of the salivary gland and associated salivary secretions. In these condi-tions, one therapeutic approach is to generate saliva by stimulating accessory salivary glands which are more resistant to radiation. This is due to histological differences between the main and accessory salivary gland. Thus, the accessory salivary glands have a short excretory duct, slightly or not branched whereas the main salivary glands, which are clearly differentiated, provide a larger intrinsic surface to radia-tion. This can be achieved with the use of <b>auriculotherapy.</b> In this regard we would like to point out a recent article by Alimi et al 2 reporting that <b>auriculotherapy</b> ca...|$|E

40|$|This {{systematic}} review evaluated {{the effects of}} ear acupuncture, ear acupressure and <b>auriculotherapy</b> for cigarette smoking cessation (SC) at end-of-treatment (EoT), three, six and 12 months follow-up. Methods: Searches of six English and Chinese databases located 25 randomized controlled trials (3735 participants). Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias. Meta-analyses were conducted in two pools: 1. SC-specific ear acupuncture/acupressure or <b>auriculotherapy</b> (EAP/R) vs. non-specific/inactive control; and 2. SC-specific EAP/R vs. other SC-specific treatment. Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the validity of interventions as SC-specific treatments or non-specific/inactive interventions; {{and the use of}} biochemical SC confirmation. Results: Pool 1 : the 12 valid SC-specific EAP/R interventions were superior to inactive EAP/R controls at EoT (RR. = 1. 77 [1. 39, 2. 25]), three months follow-up (RR. = 1. 54 [1. 14, 2. 08]), and six months follow-up (RR. = 2. 01, [1. 23, 3. 28]) but data were insufficient at 12 months.

40|$|Background: Colposcopy is an {{invasive}} medical procedure, {{which involves}} pain and discomfort. <b>Auriculotherapy</b> {{is a medical}} technique that can facilitate the reduction of pain. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the impacts of <b>auriculotherapy</b> with electrical stimulation and Vaccaria seeds on colposcopy pain. Method: This controlled randomized, clinical trial was conducted on 93 females undergoing colposcopy in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, in 2017. The study population was selected through convenience sampling technique, and then randomly assigned into three groups, namely transcutaneous auricular stimulation (TAS), Vaccaria seeds, and placebo. The TAS group was subjected to electrical stimulation at four auricular acupuncture points 40 min before colposcopy, using a Pointer Excel stimulator (2 Hz). In the Vaccaria seed group, the seeds were fixed on the same acupoints three days prior to colposcopy. The participants were asked to press each point for 1 min, three times a day. The placebo group were provided with three adhesive patches without any seeds. After colposcopy, pain intensity was monitored using the visual analog scale. Data analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and exact Chi-square tests in SPSS software, version 22. Results: The three groups were comparable in terms of the demographic data (P> 0. 05). The mean pain intensities in theTAS, seed, and placebo groups were 49. 0 ± 24. 2, 49. 5 ± 26. 0, and 65. 1 ± 26. 6, respectively.

40|$|Background: Osteoarthritic knee (OA knee) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in the elderly. Exploration of non-invasive complementary therapies for OA knee is warranted given the limitations of pharmacologic therapies. <b>Auriculotherapy</b> (AT) is a therapeutic method in which specific points on the auricle are stimulated to treat various disorders of the body, and the therapeutic value and synergistic effect of laser <b>auriculotherapy</b> (LAT) when combined with magneto-auriculotherapy (MAT) merits further investigation. Methods: This study adopted a double-blinded four-arm randomized placebo design. The aims of study are (1) to assess the feasibility of AT among elders with OA knee in a future large-scale study, {{including the use of}} blinding in subjects and evaluators, acceptance of treatment protocol, and estimating the effect size and attrition rate; and (2) to evaluate the preliminary effect of AT in elders with OA knee. Subjects were randomly divided into four groups with different modes of AT with/without placebo objects. A total of 43 subjects completed the 6 -week intervention and post-assessment. Assessments included a numerical rating scale of pain (NRS), the timed-up-and-go test (TUGT), and standard goniometer measurements during knee flexion and extension, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to evaluate differences among groups, and Wilcoxon sign-ranked test for examining within-group comparison. Results: Preliminary results indicated the absence of differences in the NRS, TUGT, and active/passive knee flexion and extension at baseline, as well as post-therapy, between the four groups. Even though the differences of these parameters between groups were not significant, the relative differences of NRS and TUGT in subjects who received combined MAT plus LAT were higher than those treated with MAT or LAT alone, or the placebo group. Four of the six parameters demonstrated significant within group differences in subjects who received MAT and/or LAT, whereas {{no significant differences were found}} in the placebo group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the AT protocol adopted in this study for elders with OA knee is feasible and could be applied in future larger-scale study. Larger sample size should be considered in a future trial to determine the causal relationship between treatment and effect. School of Nursin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A {{comfortable}} postoperative {{return to}} daily activities {{has increased the}} need to control inflammation after third molar surgery. Anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics are not exempt from adverse effects such as allergies and chronic gastritis, {{and they are not}} without cost. The association between low-level laser and auricular acupuncture can be an alternative when conventional drugs are contraindicated. Among its advantages, we can mention the low risk of side effects, low cost and simplicity of application. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficiency of low-level laser at <b>auriculotherapy</b> points in reducing postoperative pain in lower third molar surgery. Methods/design Ninety bilateral, symmetrical lower third molar surgeries will be performed in 45 healthy patients. Each patient will be their own control, through a split-mouth crossover study. One side of the mouth will be randomly chosen and, immediately after surgery, will be treated with low-level laser. After 21 days, the contralateral side will be operated on with low-level laser simulation used postoperatively. This regimen (laser application or not) will be repeated at 24 and 48 h after surgery. All patients will be requested to take analgesics (acetaminophen) if they have pain, i. e. in case of pain. Neither the surgeon nor the patients will know the assigned treatment. The primary variable will be postoperative pain assessed using a Visual Analog Scale, and the secondary variables will be trismus, edema, local temperature, dysphagia, presence of infection and painkiller ingestion. These variables will be assessed at baseline, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after surgery. Blood samples for systemic inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IL- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 8) analysis will be assessed at baseline and 24 h after surgery. Discussion Some authors believe that using a wavelength of 633 to 670 nm is a good option for laser therapy in the field of acupuncture. This wavelength can penetrate biological tissue to a depth of about 3 mm. However, for <b>auriculotherapy</b> points, the stimulus (mustard seeds, needles 1 to 2. 5 mm) does not penetrate so deeply. For this reason, we chose a laser wavelength of 660 nm (red wavelength). Trial registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT 02657174, registered on 11 January 2016...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{who are on}} {{anti-hypertensive}} therapy may {{not consistently}} achieve the recommended blood pressure (BP) level. Given this limitation of pharmacologic therapy, the exploration of non-invasive complementary methods along with conventional medicine for BP control is warranted. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify an optimal protocol for the administration of <b>auriculotherapy</b> (AT) integrated with Western medication for a better control of hypertension. This preliminary study adopted a two-arm experimental design. We enrolled patients with uncontrolled mild hypertension. The subjects in the experimental group (Group A) received an integrative approach (AT supplementing Western medication). The subjects in the comparison group (Group B) received the same kind of pellets as that in Group A, but were additionally asked to press the pellets against the acupoints thrice daily. Mean arterial BP was used as the main measure of outcome in this study. No significant difference in the therapeutic effect was observed between groups in which the pressure was applied on the magnetic pellets or not.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to investigate if <b>auriculotherapy</b> (AT) can modulate pain threshold. In our experiments, AT consisted of placing Vaccaria seeds over the "fingers point" of one ear. Two groups of healthy volunteers were enrolled for the study. Each subject was asked to perform an autoalgometric test developed by our group on three occasions: before, 1 hour after, AT and 24 hours after AT. Participants of the first group received a 2 -minute long session of AT, while participants of the second group received a 2 -minute long session of sham treatment, consisting of a puncture/massage above the skin of the neck. The autoalgometric test consisted of applying an increasing pressure with the finger-tips and finger-backs of four fingers by the subjects themselves (i. e., eight sites were evaluated) against a round-shaped needle for two times: until a minimum pain sensation (first time, minimal test) or a maximally tolerable pain sensation (second time, maximal test). Our results showed a significant higher pain threshold in the maximal test at 24 hours after AT compared to sham treatment. This result indicates {{for the first time that}} AT can increase pain tolerability, rather than affecting the minimal pain threshold...|$|E

In our experiments, AT consisted of placing Vaccaria seeds over the “fingers point ” of one ear. Two groups of healthy volunteers were enrolled for the study. Each subject was asked to perform an autoalgometric test developed by our group on three occasions: before, 1 hour after, AT and 24 hours after AT. Participants of the first group received a 2 -minute long session of AT, while participants of the second group received a 2 -minute long session of sham treatment, consisting of a puncture/massage above the skin of the neck. The autoalgometric test consisted of applying an increasing pressure with the finger-tips and finger-backs of four fingers by the subjects themselves (i. e., eight sites were evaluated) against a round-shaped needle for two times: until a minimum pain sensation (first time, minimal test) or a maximally tolerable pain sensation (second time, maximal test). Our results showed a significant higher pain threshold in the maximal test at 24 hours after AT compared to sham treatment. This result indicates {{for the first time that}} AT can increase pain tolerability, rather than affecting the minimal pain threshold. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Uncomplicated chronic rachialgia is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} complaint, and one for which therapeutic results are contradictory. The aim {{of the present study}} is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of treatment with auriculopressure, in the primary healthcare sector, carried out by trained healthcare professionals via a 30 -hour course. Methods/Design The design consists of a multi-centre randomized controlled trial, with placebo, with two parallel groups, and including an economic evaluation. Patients with chronic uncomplicated rachialgia, whose GP is considering referral for auriculopressure sensory stimulation, are eligible for inclusion. Sampling will be by consecutive selection, and randomised allocation to one of the two study arms will be determined using a centralised method, following a 1 : 1 plan (true auriculopressure; placebo auriculopressure). The implants (true and placebo) will be replaced once weekly, and the treatment will have a duration of 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be the change in pain intensity, measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 100 mm, at 9 weeks after beginning the treatment. A follow up study will be performed at 6 months after beginning treatment. An assessment will also be made of the changes measured in the Spanish version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, of the changes in the Lattinen test, and of the changes in quality of life (SF- 12). Also planned is an analysis of cost-effectiveness and also, if necessary, a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion This study will contribute to developing evidence on the use of <b>auriculotherapy</b> using Semen vaccariae [wang bu liu xing] for the treatment of uncomplicated chronic rachialgia.

40|$|Introduction: angiography, lead to {{increase}} patient’s levels of anxiety. Multiple therapies {{are used to}} reduce anxiety. This study aims to investigate {{the effect of the}} pressure of (Yintang and shenmen) points on the patients’ anxiety before the coronary angiography. Methods: This Single blind randomized controlled trial study was performed on 70 patients before angiography. After obtaining informed consent, patients were randomly assigned in intervention and control groups. Patients in the intervention group received pressure on Yintang and ear - Shenmen points for 10 minutes; one hour before angiography while patients in the control group received pressure in placebo points at the same time. Anxiety was measured by Spielberger questionnaire in 2 groups; 10 minutes before, 1 and 30 minutes after the intervention. Descriptive statistics, t-test, paired t-test and analysis of covariance were used to analyze. Result: In the intervention group, the mean score of anxiety significantly decreased from 49. 80 to 42. 17 one minute after the intervention. In the control group, anxiety increased from 48. 57 to 48. 80. The observed differences were matched by age and Anxiety level before the intervention, was (p< 0. 001). In the intervention group, the mean score of anxiety decreased from 49. 80 to 38. 05, 30 minutes after the intervention while in the control group, the mean score of anxiety increased from 48. 57 to 49. 31. The difference observed between the intervention and control groups were matched by age and Anxiety level before the intervention, (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Simultaneous Acupressure on Yintang and <b>auriculotherapy</b> in Shenmen may reduce anxiety of patients before coronary angiography...|$|E
