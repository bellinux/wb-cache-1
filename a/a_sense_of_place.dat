500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase.

500|$|The nature writers Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey, {{reviewing}} people's love of birds, {{observe that}} people are touched by feelings for birds {{in a variety of}} ways, such as enjoying the lapwing's [...] "joyous display", or the [...] "beauty and mystery" [...] of the tawny owl's call on a cold winter's night. They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> and use them [...] "as symbols of joy and love". A former statesman, Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book The Charm of Birds. Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats. Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food. A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the house sparrow has been associated with [...] "sex and lechery" [...] since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. Chaucer describes the summoner in his Canterbury Tales as being as [...] "lecherous as a sparwe".|$|E

This article analyzes interviews with participants in four U.

500|$|Much of {{the focus}} was spent on {{updating}} Modern Warfares visuals {{in order to bring}} them up to modern standards. Enhancements of the environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called [...] "Paint-over", with a larger amount of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them. Raven also wanted to give the environments <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and history to avoid feeling generic. The vast majority of objects were remodeled, with the game using improved texture depth, physically-based rendering, and light-reflection; and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models. Raven paid close attention to improving all guns in the game because, as a developer explained, [...] "We needed to take the weapons up to the same level of personality as the characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon. However, issues arose during the remastering of the game's graphics as the remaster used a heavily upgraded version of the series' engine. As a result, this meant that several of the original's visual assets were not compatible with the new technology, so the developers were necessitated to remake them. Most of the existing motion capture animation was redone for the same reason, as well as to provide further story exposition. The campaign saw a number of new first-person animations added for further immersion and emotional responses from players, and to improve how the camera made use of the player character's body, enhancing the [...] "body sense". Pellas said, [...] "I think that for [...] campaign, we were definitely more liberal with our animations and additions, as long as they enhanced the true intent of the moment." [...] The artificial intelligence of non-player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with the environment, and vice versa, such as long grass reacting to the player character's presence.|$|E
500|$|The Orphanage was {{received}} very well by American critics on its original release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 87% of critics {{had given the}} film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 168. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 74, based on 33 reviews. Critics praised the film for its lack of cheap scares. Film critic for the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert approved of the film claiming it to be [...] "deliberately aimed at viewers with developed attention spans. It lingers to create atmosphere, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place,</b> a sympathy with the characters, instead of rushing into cheap thrills". Bill Goodykoontz of the Arizona Republic echoed this statement noting, [...] "Bayona never lets The Orphanage descend into cheap horror. The scares here are expertly done and, placed {{in the context of}} Laura's state of mind, well-earned, perhaps even explainable (or not)." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star wrote, [...] "The year's best horror picture {{is also one of the}} simplest. The Orphanage makes little if any use of digital tricks to present its numerous terrors." [...] The casting of Chaplin and Rueda was praised while the role of Carlos was called dull. Goodykoontz noted the role of Carlos, saying [...] "Cayo is rather pedestrian as Carlos, but he isn't given that much to do". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune shared this opinion saying, [...] "Rueda has a great pair of peepers for this assignment. When she looks one way and then the other, while skulking through the hallways of her childhood home, every nerve-wracking whatwasthat? registers, and how. Cayo is pretty dull by comparison, but Chaplin certainly is not." [...] Liam Lacey of The Globe and Mail praised Rueda stating, [...] "The strongest appeal of the film is the brooding, intense performance by Spanish actress, Belen Rueda." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sharp's work {{coincided with}} a period of {{nationalism}} in classical music, the idea being to reinvigorate and give distinctiveness to English classical composition by grounding it in the characteristic melodic patterns and recognisable tone intervals and ornaments of its national folk music.

The use of folk songs and dance melodies and motifs in classical music to inject vitality and excitement, is of course as old as [...] "La Folia" [...] and Marin Marais' [...] "Bells of St. Genevieve" [...] ("Sonnerie de Ste-Geneviève du Mont-de-Paris"), but the attempt to give music <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> was novel to the Historical particularism of late nineteenth century Romanticism.|$|E

This assessment examines the motivations, both conscious and unconscious, that brought the client to call for a building. Secondly, there is an intersection of inner discernment with an outer, specific physical location. The given conditions of a building site are predetermined by unavoidable features, such as climate and topography. In the view of Dyson, the resulting form should express individuality of presence that shows this set of conditions. Thirdly, the design must also integrate the availability of economic resources, accessibility of building materials, and responsiveness to legal regulations. The outcome of the design process identifies human life with a given setting, creating <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place.</b> In this created place we adopt an identity of belonging that in turn marks our place in the surrounding world.

2500|$|Besides {{straightforward}} {{compassion for}} the poor, {{there are two other}} possible motivations for Mrs Thwaytes's philanthropy. Firstly there was the 19th-century progress of Evangelicalism, which encouraged good works from those with religious sensibility and social pity. [...] Secondly, following the expansion of the middle classes in the 18th and 19th centuries, beneficence was [...] "an avenue for entry into elite society for women and gave them <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and direction outside the home." [...] In other words, for a woman of known humble origins {{and at the same time}} a wealthy widow looking for a place in society, philanthropy would be in her best interests. However 19th-century British elite society was based in the popular imagination upon elegant culture, not money or good deeds, and Herne Bay Clock Tower's opening ceremony drew mockery from the Figaro in London of 6 October 1836, in which she was called a Cockney and her clock, celebration and philanthropy laughed at.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the lunch}} I {{met with a}} {{graduate}} of Cambridge (England), tutor of a grandson of Percival, with his pupil (Percival, the assassinated minister, I mean). I should not like this position of tutor to a young Englishman; it certainly has an ugly twang of upper servitude. I observed that the tutor gave his pupil the best seat in the railway carriage, and in all respects provided for his comfort before thinking of his own; and this, not as a father does for his child, out of love, but from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and duty, which I did not quite see how a gentleman could consent to feel.

He did not like him, however,--thought him a [...] "dangerous man," [...] as well as I could gather; he thinks there is some radical defect in K------'s moral nature, a lack of sincerity; and, furthermore, he believes {{him to be a}} sensualist in his disposition, in support of which view he said Mr. K------ had made drawings, such as no pure man could have made, or could allow himself to show or look at.

I have judged several persons in this way, and still judge them so, though the world has cone to very different conclusions.
