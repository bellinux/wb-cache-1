40|$|Abstract This {{investigation}} tested {{whether people}} {{are more willing to}} experience <b>and</b> express <b>sadness,</b> the more useful they expect sadness to be. Building on assumptions about the function of sadness, we predicted that people would expect sadness to be more useful when eliciting help to prevent a loss (vs. not). In Study 1, we examined pref-erences for <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> its expected usefulness when eliciting donations for the sake of preventing a loss (vs. not). In Study 2, participants expected to elicit help to prevent a loss (vs. attain a benefit). In both studies, par-ticipants expected sadness to be more useful and were more willing to experience <b>and</b> express <b>sadness</b> when eliciting help to prevent a loss (vs. other reasons). Furthermore, the more useful participants expected experiencing <b>and</b> expressing <b>sadness</b> to be, the more willing they were to experience <b>and</b> to express <b>sadness,</b> respectively. We dis-cuss the implications for research on emotion regulation...|$|R

The EP utilizes dance and pop music, with each song being influenced by pop rock, electronica, and trip hop music. Like Rainbow, it contains ambient-influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering. The lyrical content deals with freedom, fun <b>and</b> <b>sadness,</b> continuing themes seen on her previous album.|$|E

In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.|$|E

Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors.

At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock <b>and</b> <b>sadness,</b> unable to act as Sophia walks towards them.

Inside Headquarters, her emotions all work together on a new expanded console with room for them all, allowing Riley to lead a more emotionally complex life.|$|E
5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel good while playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After coming up with ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she and her team spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness <b>and</b> <b>sadness.</b> To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, and she felt very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a dark background, making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain <b>and</b> <b>sadness</b> is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E

40|$|We {{critically}} review evolutionary {{theories of}} {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD). Because most instances of MDD appear {{to be caused by}} adversity, evolutionary theories of MDD generally propose that <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> low mood evolved as beneficial responses to adversity, and that MDD is dysfunctional <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> low mood. If so, MDD research should focus much more heavily on understanding the healthy functions of <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> low mood to better understand how they dysfunction. A debate about the boundary between healthy <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> MDD is then reviewed. In part, this debate turns on whether MDD’s costliest symptoms could provide unknown benefits. Therefore, the review concludes by discussing 2 theories that explore possible benefits of prolonged anhedonia and suicidality...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradox of}} enjoying {{listening}} to music that evokes sadness {{is yet to be}} fully understood. Unlike prior studies that have explored potential explanations related to lyrics, memories, and mood regulation, we investigated the types of emotions induced by unfamiliar, instrumental sad music, and whether these responses are consistently associated with certain individual difference variables. One hundred and two participants were drawn from a representative sample to minimise self-selection bias. The results suggest that the emotional responses induced by unfamiliar sad music could be characterized in terms of three underlying factors: Relaxing <b>sadness,</b> Moving <b>sadness,</b> <b>and</b> Nervous <b>sadness.</b> Relaxing sadness was characterized by felt and perceived peacefulness and positive valence. Moving sadness captured an intense experience that involved feelings of <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> being moved. Nervous sadness was associated with felt anxiety, perceived scariness and negative valence. These interpretations were supported by indirect measures of felt emotion. Experiences of Moving sadness were strongly associated with high trait empathy and emotional contagion, but not with other previously suggested traits such as absorption or nostalgia-proneness. Relaxing <b>sadness</b> <b>and</b> Nervous <b>sadness</b> were not significantly predicted by any of the individual difference variables. The findings are interpreted within a theoretical framework of embodied emotions...|$|R
