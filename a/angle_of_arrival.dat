50|$|Appleton {{thought the}} best place to look for {{evidence}} of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions. It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference (the first being the ground wave) was coming down from the ionosphere. The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection (thus the lower boundary of the reflecting layer) to be determined. The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial.|$|E

50|$|With active cancellation, {{the target}} generates a radar signal equal in {{intensity}} but opposite in phase {{to the predicted}} reflection of an incident radar signal (similarly to noise canceling ear phones). This creates destructive interference between the reflected and generated signals, resulting in reduced RCS. To incorporate active cancellation techniques, the precise characteristics of the waveform and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> of the illuminating radar signal must be known, since they define the nature of generated energy required for cancellation. Except against simple or low frequency radar systems, the implementation of active cancellation techniques is extremely difficult due to the complex processing requirements {{and the difficulty of}} predicting the exact nature of the reflected radar signal over a broad aspect of an aircraft, missile or other target.|$|E

50|$|Many RTLS systems require {{direct and}} clear {{line of sight}} {{visibility}}. For those systems, {{where there is no}} visibility from mobile tags to fixed nodes there will be no result or a non valid result from locating engine. This applies to satellite locating as well as other RTLS systems such as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival</b> and time of arrival. Fingerprinting is a way to overcome the visibility issue: If the locations in the tracking area contain distinct measurement fingerprints, line of sight is not necessarily needed. For example, if each location contains a unique combination of signal strength readings from transmitters, the location system will function properly. This is true, for example, with some Wi-Fi based RTLS solutions. However, having distinct signal strength fingerprints in each location typically requires a fairly high saturation of transmitters.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2000 The {{enumeration}} of fish is {{of critical}} importance to the management of both commercial and sport fisheries in Alaska and worldwide. Current methods for riverine fish enumeration are inaccurate and unreliable. Improved fish counting accuracy in Alaskan rivers by acoustic methods is required. A split beam sonar system {{in the presence of}} noise is modeled. The sonar system including the received sonar pulse, receiver system, transducer beam pattern, propagation losses, and noise are modeled. An analysis of the effects of noise, pulse duration and sampling frequency on the uncertainty in fish location is presented. Signal to noise ratios less than 5 dB can cause significant errors in the calculation of received signal phase. A stationary fish with a signal to noise ratio of 15 dB has approximately plus-minus 0. 001 degrees of uncertainty in the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival.</b> Reducing the SNR to 3 dB the uncertainty increases to plus-minus 3. 6 degrees in the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrival...</b>|$|R
