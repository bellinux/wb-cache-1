5|$|Blacktip sharks showing curiosity towards divers {{has been}} reported, but they remain <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance. Under most circumstances, these timid sharks are not {{regarded}} as highly dangerous to humans. However, they may become aggressive {{in the presence}} of food, and their size and speed invite respect. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 28 unprovoked attacks (one fatal) and 13 provoked attacks by this species. Blacktip sharks are responsible annually for 16% of the shark attacks around Florida. Most attacks by this species result in only minor wounds.|$|E
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for the accommodations for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|Union {{infantry}} attacked {{from the}} east side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry attacked from the south and west. Capehart's brigade attacked from the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|E

The boat trip to the hunting lodge he built there took two-hours, so Knapp had a 180-hp airplane motor mounted to his river boat, Arcady. The trip then took 30 minutes. After a flood decimated the lodge at Rock Creek, Knapp purchased one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> location.|$|R
5|$|A {{worldwide}} backlash {{over the}} resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> house. Thor departs {{to consult with}} Dr. Erik Selvig {{on the meaning of}} the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. The ferocity of the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no records}} of {{diseases}} experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness {{dates from the}} time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the Consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel Gorman from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. He was treated with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation over his own personal health. The fistula would later stabilise <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> and unnoticeable size.|$|E
50|$|If {{the knife}} {{has a strong}} tip, then the knife {{can also be used}} as a weapon for self defense. Some knives even include holes in the handle such that the knife can be {{fastened}} to a long stick and then it functions as a spear tip. The capability to mount the knife on a stick to create a spear allows the user to better hunt wildlife <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> distance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} located along the Millstone River in Millstone Borough. It exemplifies Wright's [...] "Usonian" [...] philosophy and employs his early green building principles, including minimizing {{the size of}} the house and ancillary spaces, pioneering passive solar and radiant heat design, employing natural daylight and recycling construction waste. As its location was prone to flooding, the owners sought to relocate and rebuild it <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> site in order to preserve it.|$|R

5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He {{decided to do}} so only at 09:00, {{when it became clear}} that the other two companies were <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance, and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, then the rest of the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After they came to a small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Although the Royal Navy {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as vital to the rise of the British Empire, the British Army {{played an important role in}} the formation of colonies, protectorates and dominions in the Americas, Africa, Asia, India and Australasia. British soldiers captured strategically-important territories, and the army was involved in wars to secure the empire's borders and support friendly governments. Among these actions were the Seven Years' War, the American Revolutionary War, the Napoleonic Wars, the First and Second Opium Wars, the Boxer Rebellion, the New Zealand Wars, the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the first and second Boer Wars, the Fenian raids, the Irish War of Independence, interventions in Afghanistan (intended to maintain a buffer state between British India and the Russian Empire) and the Crimean War (to keep the Russian Empire <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance by aiding Turkey). Like the English Army, the British Army fought the kingdoms of Spain, France (including the Empire of France) and the Netherlands for supremacy in North America and the West Indies. With native and provincial assistance, the army conquered New France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War and suppressed a Native American uprising in Pontiac's War. The British Army was defeated in the American Revolutionary War, losing the Thirteen Colonies but retaining The Canadas and The Maritimes as British North America.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> position on the circuit.|$|E

50|$|Scorpion - Version {{fitted with}} 2B9 Vasilek 82 mm {{automatic}} mortar. This {{is a heavy}} chassis HMMWV developed in 2004 by engineers at the U.S. Army's Picatinny Arsenal. The mortar itself can fire on single shots or on automatic using 4 round clips. Range for direct fire is 1,000m and indirect fire is 4,000m. It is also intended to provide another means of destroying roadside bombs but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> standoff range. Only one has been produced.|$|R
5000|$|The first Fort Carlton (1795-1801) {{was built}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> site near the old French post of Fort de la Corne in 1795 {{following}} {{the destruction of}} South Branch House. James Bird was in charge; James Sandison (Sanderson) was his assistant; and John Peter Pruden was an apprentice. From 1799 to 1801, Joseph Howse (Howes) was the writer in charge. The NWC had a nearby post called Fort St. Louis. It produced few furs and was closed in 1801.|$|R

25|$|When {{speed limits}} are arbitrary, {{such as when}} set through {{political}} rather than empirical processes, the speed limit's relationship to the maximum safe speed is weakened or intentionally eliminated. Therefore, a crash can be counted as speed-related even if it occurs <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> speed, simply because the speed was in excess of a politically determined limit.|$|E

25|$|The first {{successful}} rearing of a secretarybird in captivity occurred in 1986 at the Oklahoma City Zoo. Although secretarybirds build their nests {{in the trees}} in the wild, the captive birds at the Oklahoma City Zoo built theirs on the ground, which left their eggs open to depredation by local wild mammals. Therefore, zoo staff removed the eggs from the nest each time they were laid to be incubated and hatched <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> location.

50|$|Keutsang Hermitage (ke’u tshang) is a {{historical}} hermitage, belonging to the Sera Monastery, about 8 km northwest of Lhasa in Tibet Autonomous Region. The hermitage was in a precariously perched cave once inhabited by the great Tibetan guru Tsongkhapa. However, the original cave collapsed in a landslide. What is present now was rebuilt, adjoining the ruined Keutsang West Hermitage, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safer</b> location. <b>As</b> it exists now, Keutsang is {{to the east of}} Sera on a hillside above Lhasa’s principal cemetery.

25|$|Attacking pieces {{can easily}} become trapped behind enemy lines, as the {{opponent}} can often drop a pawn on a protected square {{to cut off}} the line of retreat. For this reason, rooks, which can retreat in only one direction, are commonly kept <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance in the early parts of the game, and used to support attacks by weaker pieces. However, once the game has opened up, a promoted rook is an especially deadly piece behind enemy lines.|$|E
25|$|Concerns over {{inadequate}} {{warnings and}} safeguards have included that the two-foot wide yellow platform markings may not keep people <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> distance as trains pass at high speed. Suggestions include platform safety barriers, {{or use of}} different announcements for approaching Acela trains versus slower ones. In 2011, federal transportation grants were awarded to improve Kingston station, including {{the construction of a}} third track to be used by the Acela as a through track to bypass the station, helping to alleviate safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|At 12:45 {{the crew}} opened {{gas release valve}} for three minutes to {{initiate}} descent; the hot balloon did not respond as planned and travel to 18,000 metres took more than two hours.
