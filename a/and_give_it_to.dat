5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, Lithuanian {{businessman}} Darius Mockus {{offered a}} 1-million-Euro reward {{to anyone who}} could find the original document <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the State of Lithuania. The offer's deadline was set to 16 February 2018, when Lithuania will commemorate the 100th anniversary of its declaration of independence. On 29 March 2017, Vytautas Magnus University professor Liudas Mažylis announced {{he had found the}} original document in the Federal Foreign Office Political Archive in Berlin, Germany, hand-written in the Lithuanian language and signed by the twenty. He also announced that he had found the German-language version of the 16 February 1918 document and the Act of 11 December 1917. The latter displays nineteen signatures (without that of Pranas Dovydaitis). Germany confirmed the documents' authenticity on the following day and they were displayed publicly by two officials — Michael Roth, the German Minister of State for Europe, and Deividas Matulionis, Lithuania ambassador in Germany. On October 5, 2017, Lithuania Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevičius and Germany Minister of Foreign Affairs Sigmar Gabriel signed an agreement that the original Act of Independence will be displayed for five years in the House of the Signatories where it was originally signed, making it the main symbol of the Lithuania's Centenary of the Restoration of the State celebrations.|$|E

25|$|Discriminatory {{land use}} {{policies}} {{had been introduced}} prior to 1929, which made it such that clergy who wanted land plots for private cultivation needed special permission and that this permission could only be given {{if no one else}} requested the land for use, and if such a request did arise the state could confiscate the land from the clergyman <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the person who requested it. The clergy also had no priority in claim to the land that belonged to the Church prior to 1917. In 1928 it was made illegal for clergy to join co-operative and collective farms. In addition there were no laws that limited the rights of local governments to refuse land plots to clergy arbitrarily. All of this legislation contributed to {{a situation in which the}} clergy had no land to cultivate.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the {{government}} again {{planned to take}} public forest land <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> its supporters. While protesting this and collecting petition signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near Mount Kenya, Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate Saba Saba Day, Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged. In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies.

25|$|Carey and Hoffa battled {{fiercely}} at the Teamsters' {{convention in}} July 1996. Hoffa introduced {{a resolution to}} deny convention voting rights to 80 delegates from the union's staff, although this right {{had been given to}} all previous presidents. Carey ordered a voice vote on the motion, announced that the motion was defeated, and ignored calls for a division of the house. Throughout the convention, Hoffa and his supporters introduced resolutions and constitutional amendments intended to transfer authority from the president <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> local and regional offices. Hoffa's supporters were well-organized and highly disciplined, and they defeated Carey on several minor votes. But once it became clear that Hoffa had a slim majority of the 1,900 delegates, Carey used the power of parliamentary procedure to delay or defeat the proposals, and his supporters brought the convention to a halt by offering amendment after amendment to Hoffa's proposals.|$|E

25|$|Determined to {{help the}} boys slay the griefer, the {{executives}} decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths, a weapon so powerful that it {{was removed from the}} game and stored on a 1 GB USB flash drive. Unaware of the plan however, the boys have already initiated what becomes a seventeen-hour battle against the griefer. The executives arrive at Stan's house with the flash drive, unaware that the boys are actually at Cartman's house. Randy tells the executives that he can log in with the sword <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the boys' characters online. Eventually logging onto a demo of the game at a Best Buy, Randy gives Stan the weapon, but Randy's character is mortally wounded by the griefer in the process. Enraged, Stan attacks the griefer with the sword, allowing Kyle and Kenny to attack. Cartman approaches him and proceeds to smash the griefer's head with a hammer. Numerous World of Warcraft players celebrate the griefer's demise, praising the boys as heroes.|$|E

25|$|In a {{rally in}} Buxar on 26 October, Modi vowed to defend {{reservation}} of Dalits, STs, OBCs. He said of the Mahagathbandhanthat {{it was trying to}} hatch a conspiracy to carve out a sub-quota on the basis of religion as the Supreme Court of India has said reservation cannot be more than 50%. On 27 October, in Bettiah, he again accused Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav of diluting the share of SC, ST and OBC. It promoted the view that an attempt was being made to take the reservation of Dalits and other OBCs <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> other minorities. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also agreed with Modi's assertions that the idea of reservations on the basis of religion is fraught with danger. On 1 November, Modi repeated the allegations that the two leaders came together in July 2005 to demand a review of the policy to provide for religion-based reservation. A video dating from 2005 which was leaked showed Lalu was asking for a quota for Muslims. On 3 July, BJP announced its seventh morcha, the BJP OBC Morcha, reportedly in regards to the election.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Maathai learned of a {{government}} plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters {{to the government and}} the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage. Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.|$|E
500|$|In 1926 {{an effort}} was made to lease the Maghrebi waqf, which {{included}} the wall, with the plan of eventually buying it. Negotiations were begun in secret by the Jewish judge Gad Frumkin, with financial backing from American millionaire Nathan Straus. The chairman of the Palestine Zionist Executive, Colonel F. H. Kisch, explained that the aim was [...] "quietly to evacuate the Moroccan occupants of those houses which it would later be necessary to demolish" [...] to create an open space with seats for aged worshippers to sit on. However, Straus withdrew when the price became excessive and the plan came to nothing. The Va'ad Leumi, against the advice of the Palestine Zionist Executive, demanded that the British expropriate the wall <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Jews, but the British refused.|$|E

Pliny the Elder claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole {{sentences}} in Latin and Greek, and in Henry IV, William Shakespeare had Hotspur declare [...] "The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer.

Olympic medallist Kriss Akabusi construed Bolt's chest slapping before the finish line as showboating, noting that the actions cost Bolt an even faster record time. IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful. Bolt denied {{that this was the}} purpose of his celebration by saying, [...] "I wasn't bragging. When I saw I wasn't covered, I was just happy". Lamine Diack, president of the IAAF, supported Bolt and said that his celebration was appropriate given the circumstances of his victory. Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, [...] "We have to see it in the glory of their moment <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them.

500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts.

However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E
