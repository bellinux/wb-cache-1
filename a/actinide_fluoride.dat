40|$|Synthesis of {{actinium}} mononitrides using carbothermic {{reduction of}} the corresponding oxides has a few outstanding issues, including the formation of secondary phases such as oxides and carbides and low densities of the final product. Furthermore the requirement of a high process temperature at 1700 Â°C, for more than 12 hours is also a drawback particularly for Americium-bearing samples. Therefore, {{it is important to}} explore the use of other possible routes to synthesize actinide mononitrides. A low temperature process is used in this research to produce actinide mononitrides using a fluoride route in which {{the first step is to}} mix the actinide oxide with NH 4 HF 2. The second step involves the heat-treatment of the resulting ammonium <b>actinide</b> <b>fluoride</b> salts in ammonia atmosphere. Using different analytical techniques available, the experimental conditions can be studied and optimized to synthesize the required materials with high phase purity. Such available techniques are X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG/DSC), and microscopic techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Once the experimental conditions are studied and optimized, a number of actinide nitride systems (uranium, thorium, and neptunium) will be synthesized and characterized to provide knowledge on the chemistry of the systems. Characterization of these nitride systems will include chemical phase identification, lattice parameter refinements, morphological studies, microstructural verifications, thermal behavior, reaction mechanism, and reaction kinetics...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the first}} chapter was {{generalization}} of data on solubility and equilibrium states of fission product and <b>actinide</b> <b>fluorides</b> in fluoride salt melts-solvents and fuel composition melts based on LiF-BeF{sub 2 } mixture which was proposed as fuel basis for ABC/ATW facility. The second chapter is devoted to description of processes proposed for the chemical-technological complex of the ABC/ATW facility and their physico-chemical peculiarities. The complex {{is responsible for the}} removal of fission products and actinides from irradiated fuel salt...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{relativistic}} energy-consistent pseudopotentials (PPs) for f-elements have been adjusted. The PP approach restricts the explicit calculations to the chemically relevant valence electron system and implicitly includes relativistic effects {{by means of}} a simple parameterization. Thus, it is a commonly used approximation to study molecules containing f-elements, where the large number of electrons and the significant relativistic effects are the main obstacles. Even difficulties due to open shells can be avoided, if these are included in the core, as it is the case for f-in-core PPs. However, if the f shell is not treated explicitly, one PP for each oxidation state has to be adjusted. This thesis completes the already existing quasirelativistic f-in-core PPs, i. e. 5 f-in-core PPs for di- (Pu-No), tetra- (Th-Cf), penta- (Pa-Am), and hexavalent (U-Am) actinides and 4 f-in-core PPs for tetravalent (Ce-Nd, Tb, Dy) lanthanides are presented. Corresponding molecular basis sets of polarized valence double- to quadruple-zeta quality have been derived. Smaller basis sets suitable for crystal calculations form subsets of these basis sets. Furthermore, core-polarization potentials for di-, tri-, and tetravalent actinides have been adjusted to account for the neglect of static and dynamic core-polarization. Atomic test calculations on actinide ionization potentials as well as molecular test calculations on <b>actinide</b> and lanthanide <b>fluorides</b> using the Hartree-Fock and coupled cluster method show satisfactory agreement with calculations using f-in-valence PPs and experimental data, respectively, except for plutonium difluoride and neptunium, plutonium, and americium hexafluoride. While for plutonium difluoride the large deviations are {{due to the fact that}} for plutonium the divalent oxidation state is not stable, in the hexavalent case the 5 f-in-core approximation seems to reach its limitations except for uranium. Moreover, the 5 f-in-core PPs are successfully applied to actinocenes, actinyl ions, and uranyl(VI) complexes. Thus, the f-in-core PPs should be an efficient computational tool for those compounds, where the f orbitals do not participate significantly in chemical bonding. In addition to the quasirelativistic f-in-core PPs, the recently adjusted 5 f-in-valence uranium PP including scalar-relativistic effects as well as spin-orbit coupling have been tested by calculating the fine-structure splittings of U 5 + and U 4 +. These test calculations gave reliable results and thus confirm earlier benchmark calculations on uranium monohydride...|$|R
