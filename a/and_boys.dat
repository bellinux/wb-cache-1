5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls <b>and</b> <b>boys</b> played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback.

She was a strong believer in moral temperance and argued that parental hypocrisy caused many children to imitate their parents' actions. She said that it was a woman's religious duty to educate herself. She urged women to take advantage of public resources like libraries and museums, or if time did not permit, to enlarge their minds at Relief Society meetings.|$|E

5|$|During the European {{food crisis}} of the 1840s, food prices rose sharply to around three times the pre-crisis prices, and the {{relatively}} low-paid bal maidens of Devon Great Consols demanded increased pay to cover food costs. While the mine owners initially met their demands, once the food price stabilised the pay rate was then reduced to previous levels causing around 200 bal maidens <b>and</b> <b>boys</b> to walkout. On their return to {{work the next day}} all the striking workers were summarily dismissed and either replaced with new workers, or re-hired at an even lower pay rate than before. Bal maidens went on strike on at least six other occasions in the 19thcentury, but Cornwall's high unemployment meant the strikes were generally unsuccessful as workers could easily be replaced.|$|E
