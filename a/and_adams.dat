She tries to seduce him on the beach but <b>Adam</b> refuses <b>and</b> Cammie realizes he is a virgin, finding it sweet. Still, she doesn't want people to think she has lost her reputation as a vixen and so Cammie tells everyone she <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> are having amazing sex, unbeknownst to him. Cammie <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> do attempt to have sex throughout the course of the book but they are always interrupted. Eventually, she <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> agree to wait until the time is right.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{municipalities}} and counties in Ohio have adopted pennants and swallowtails {{based on the}} state burgee. The city of Mentor <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> County have flags that essentially replace the annulus with a seal and modify the pattern of stars in the triangular union.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park {{operates}} year-round. Camping is {{most practical}} in winter months, when mosquitoes are less troublesome on the keys. Private concessioners provide full day tours {{in the park}} that include snorkeling, hiking, paddling and sailing from the park headquarters. Boat excursions to Boca Chita <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> Key are also available.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2010 season, the Roughriders {{chose not}} to resign Adams. The Edmonton Eskimos {{expressed}} interest, <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> {{signed a contract with}} them for the 2011 season. He never played a regular season game for the Eskimos, and was eventually released. Adams later returned to the Arena Football League and signed with the Spokane Shock in 2012 before retiring from professional football.|$|E

5|$|The Stamp Act was {{scheduled}} {{to go into effect}} on November 1, 1765, but it was not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.|$|E
5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> reluctantly accommodated. It became apparent that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E
5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E

50|$|From August 1993 to January 1996, Riki co-hosted {{the radio}} advice program Loveline with Doctor Drew Pinsky <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> Carolla. The trio hosted {{together}} until friction between Riki <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> led Riki {{to leave the}} show in January 1996.|$|R
5000|$|Satan <b>and</b> <b>Adam,</b> a blues duo {{consisting}} of Sterling [...] "Mister Satan" [...] Magee (born 1936) <b>and</b> <b>Adam</b> Gussow (born 1958; New York City, New York), were a fixture on Harlem's sidewalks {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s.|$|R
5|$|A pilot {{programme}} was commissioned in March 1977, and was {{recorded by the}} end of the following June. A second series was commissioned in 1979, transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were re-recorded for release on LP records and audio cassettes <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> adapted the first series into a best-selling novel in 1979. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, a second novel was published and the first series was adapted for television. This was followed by three further novels, a computer game, and various other media.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|A two-man {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{signed with}} World Championship Wrestling (WCW) {{and made his}} debut on the February 16, 1998 episode of Nitro as a heel by attacking Bret Hart, {{revealing}} himself as {{the newest member of}} the New World Order (nWo). Adams made his in-ring debut on the February 19 episode of Thunder in a tag team match with nWo teammate Curt Hennig against Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart, with the match resulting in a double disqualification. The nWo split in April 1998 <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> chose to join Hollywood Hogan's nWo Hollywood faction. Adams made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at Slamboree against Lex Luger in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} album, Room Service, significant portions of the album were produced while on tour. According to co-writer Jim Vallance modern technology and equipment made {{it a lot easier}} to record the album. Adams recorded the album while on tour, making use of the time between playing on stage and readying himself for the next gig. Vallance <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> recorded the album normally while sitting backstage or in an hotel room with small devices which they usually carried along on tours, but especially during their off days. Adams, in an interview, mentioned that when recording a song, they needed to set up mattresses against the windows, and having microphones run through the toilet.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, young oilmen Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams {{sought a}} National Football League franchise. They found that NFL {{expansion}} required a unanimous vote of existing team owners, {{so there was}} little likelihood of convincing the NFL to expand. The two men attempted to acquire the Chicago Cardinals, intending to move the franchise to Dallas, {{where there was no}} NFL team. Cardinals co-owner Walter Wolfner, who owned the team with his wife, Violet Bidwill Wolfner, was unwilling to sell majority control. During the discussions, Walter Wolfner mentioned the names of other wealthy bidders seeking to acquire the Cardinals. On the flight home, Hunt <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> decided to recruit the other bidders as owners of teams in a new professional football league.|$|E

5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed {{it has long been}} the subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|The French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, {{disapproved of}} Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, and Henry Laurens were {{appointed}} {{to collaborate with}} Adams; nevertheless, Jefferson {{did not go to}} Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic. Jay, Adams, and Franklin played the major part in the final negotiations. Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay <b>and</b> <b>Adams</b> decided not to consult with France; instead, they dealt directly with the British commissioners.|$|E
