5|$|In the 1450s, King Thomas vigorously {{searched for}} {{suitable}} spouses {{for the children}} from his first marriage. Stephen's two sisters were married off in 1451, and in 1453 Stephen too entered his father's considerations. Wishing to gain control over the <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> of Petar Talovac, who had governed Croatia proper as ban {{on behalf of the}} Hungarian king, Thomas attempted to have Stephen marry Talovac's widow, Hedwig Garai. Kosača too hastened to marry the wealthy widow, leading to an armed conflict, but neither prevailed due to an intervention by the Republic of Venice on behalf of Talovac's heirs.|$|E
25|$|In 1548, the nobility’s {{attempts}} to weaken farmers’ <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> right (Norwegian: odelsrett) were {{rejected by the}} King and the Danish Council of the Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 19th century, {{there existed}} feudally-based {{privileges}} in landowning (farmland {{by its nature}} exempt from regular land taxation irrespective of who owned it), being connected to nobility-related lordships and to <b>allodial</b> <b>land.</b> Fiefs were common in late medieval and early modern eras.|$|E
5000|$|The {{county of}} Bar {{originated}} in the frontier fortress of Bar (from Latin barra, barrier) that Duke Frederick I of Upper Lorraine built {{on the bank of}} the river Ornain around 960. The fortress was originally directed at the counts of Champagne, who had made incursions into Frederick's <b>allodial</b> <b>lands.</b> Frederick also confiscated some lands from the nearby Abbey of Saint-Mihiel and settled his knights on it. The original Barrois was thus a mixture of the duke's <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> and confiscated church lands enfeoffed to knights. On the death of Duke Frederick III in 1033, these lands passed to his sister, Sophia (died 1093), who was the first person to associate the comital title with Bar, styling herself [...] "Countess of Bar".|$|R
5000|$|Ottokar is {{documented}} as {{a count in}} the eastern Chiemgau about 1048. By his mother he inherited extended <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> and the margravial title in the Traungau region around the fortress of Steyr. He also served a Vogt (reeve) of the Lambach, Traunkirchen, Obermünster, and Persenbeug monasteries and was co-founder of Admont Abbey.|$|R
5000|$|William of Winchester (11 April 1184 [...] - [...] 13 December 1213), {{also called}} William of Lüneburg (Wilhelm von Lüneburg) or William Longsword, {{a member of}} the House of Welf, was heir to his family's <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> in the Duchy of Saxony after the {{deposition}} of his father, Duke Henry the Lion in 1180.|$|R
25|$|As {{the need}} for such service {{functions}} became more acute (as, for example, during the Investiture Controversy), and their duties and privileges, at first nebulous, became more clearly defined, the ministeriales developed in the Salian period (1024–1125) into a new and much differentiated class. They received fiefs, which to begin with were not heritable, in return for which they provided knightly services. They were also allowed to possess, and often did hold, allods: ownership of real property (land, buildings and fixtures) that is independent of any superior landlord, but it {{should not be confused with}} anarchy as the owner of <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> is not independent of his sovereign. Ministerials were found holding the four great offices necessary to run a great household: seneschal, butler, marshal and chamberlain. They were vidames (vice dominus, or runners of estates) or castellans, having both military and administrative responsibilities. Conrad II of Kuchl was the financial adviser to four archbishops over the course of 40 years.|$|E
25|$|New {{conflict}} {{emerged in}} 1453 upon {{the death of}} Petar Talovac, who had governed Croatia proper as ban {{on behalf of the}} Hungarian king. Both Thomas and his recently widowed father-in-law wished to gain control of Talovac's <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> by offering marriage to his widow, Hedwig Garai; Kosača proposed himself, while Thomas suggested his son Stephen. Kosača invited Turks to Bosnia in autumn but neither prevailed as Venice moved in to protect Talovac's heirs. They then made peace, realizing that the Ottomans, who had just stunned Europe by conquering Constantinople, would soon be at their gates as well. Another concern was the end of regency for the hitherto underage Hungarian king Ladislaus the Posthumous, which decreased the influence of Thomas' friend János Hunyadi and led to the rise of Ulrich of Celje, who was supported by Kosača. After Ladislaus made Ulrich the new Ban of Croatia, the latter started seizeing control of Croatian towns, which met strong opposition from Thomas. The Bosnian king feared that Ulrich's would take Talovac's land and have his territory border Kosača's. Not wishing to break peace with his father-in-law yet again, the King turned to Venice for help.|$|E
5000|$|Mulk = {{private or}} <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> (held in {{absolute}} ownership).|$|E
50|$|The von Altenstein {{family was}} able to {{establish}} a small territory for itself around the castle during the 14th and 15th centuries. This enabled the scattered <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> of the family to be consolidated. The economic success of the castellans of the time {{can be seen from}} the impressive structures of the castle that have survived.|$|R
50|$|The Niederlahngau {{was held}} by the Conradines until {{the second half of}} the 10th century. The last mention of a Conradine count was in 966. The Niederlahngau went over to the Countship of Diez. The {{extensive}} Conradine <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> in the Niederlahngau came, probably through familial relationships, to the Counts of (Alt-) Leiningen. After the extinction of this house in 1220, it was distributed among the related dynasties of Nassau, Runkel/Westerburg, Isenburg/Limburg, and Virneburg.|$|R
50|$|While King Louis the German was {{preoccupied with}} Imperial politics, Liudolf, {{relying on the}} rank {{as well as the}} <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> he had {{inherited}} from his ancestors, rose to a leading position among the Saxon nobles - made evident by the marriage of his daughter Liutgard with King Louis the Younger. He is buried in his proprietary monastery of Brunshausen (Brunistishusun). His successions by his sons Bruno and Otto met with no resistance.|$|R
50|$|In 1548, the nobility’s {{attempts}} to weaken farmers’ <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> right (Norwegian: odelsrett) were {{rejected by the}} King and the Danish Council of the Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Waqf = <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> in {{mortmain}} tenure, being land assured to pious foundations or {{revenue from}} land assured to pious foundations; also usufruct State land {{of which the}} State revenues are assured to pious foundations.|$|E
50|$|Bjǫrn, Finnviðr's son, {{had this}} rock-slab cut {{in memory of}} Óleifr, his brother. He was betrayed at Finnheiðr. May God help his spirit. This estate is the <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> and family {{inheritance}} of Finnviðr's sons at Elgjastaðir.|$|E
50|$|Otto {{remained}} in arms against the king {{until his death}} on 11 January 1083. He is buried in the Nicolai Chapel in Northeim. His personal estates in Saxony later passed to Lothair of Supplinburg, who about 1100 married Otto's granddaughter Richenza of Northeim. After Richenza, German queen from 1125 and Holy Roman Empress from 1133, died in 1141, the <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> were inherited by her daughter Gertrude and her husband, the Welf duke Henry the Proud.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Allodial</b> <b>lands</b> are the {{absolute}} property of their owner and {{not subject to}} any rent, service, or acknowledgment to a superior. Allodial title is therefore an alternative to feudal land tenure. However, historian J.C. Holt states that [...] "In Normandy the word alodium, whatever its sense {{in other parts of}} the Continent, meant not land held free of seigneurial services, but land held by hereditary right," [...] and that [...] "alodium and feodum should be given the same meaning in England." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of his godfather, Duke Henry III of Carinthia, the last ruler from the House of Eppenstein, he was enfeoffed with the Carinthian duchy and the Veronese march by Emperor Henry V. He did, however, not inherit Henry's <b>allodial</b> <b>lands,</b> which passed to the Margrave Leopold of Styria, a member of the Traungau dynasty (Otakars). This {{resulted}} in the so-called provincia Graslupp, that is, the estates of Neumarkt and Sankt Lambrecht as well as the Murau region, which had previously belonged to the Carinthian county of Friesach, passing to the March of Styria.|$|R
50|$|An {{allodial estate}} {{could also be}} created when a lord renounced his rights in favour of his vassal. Deforested land was {{considered}} allodial by the princes. Conversely, free territorial lords were sometimes punished by the Emperor by converting their <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> into fiefs.|$|E
50|$|Up to the 19th century, {{there existed}} feudally-based {{privileges}} in landowning (farmland {{by its nature}} exempt from regular land taxation irrespective of who owned it), being connected to nobility-related lordships and to <b>allodial</b> <b>land.</b> Fiefs were common in late medieval and early modern eras.|$|E
50|$|Property owned under {{allodial title}} is {{referred}} to as <b>allodial</b> <b>land,</b> allodium, or an allod. In the Domesday Book it is called alod. Historically, allodial title was sometimes used to distinguish ownership of land without feudal duties from ownership by feudal tenure which restricted alienation and burdened land with the tenurial rights of a landholder's overlord or sovereign.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent to}} which each of these modes of law applied to the several {{countries}} under Ottoman rule varied, and was largely dependent upon the country itself. For example, {{not all of these}} modes of user were actually found in Palestine. The extent of mulk or <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> (privately owned property) in Palestine was limited, and was usually only found in the old cities or in garden areas. Rural land in this category was rare. In nearly all cases (excluding only “Waqf” lands, and communal profits-à-prendre land, or dead and undeveloped land), lands were either mulk or miri tenures.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a younger}} son of Margrave Eckard I of Meissen {{and his wife}} Swanehilde. Eckard was a count in the Gau Chutizi east of Merseburg {{as well as in}} the burgward of Teuchern. Upon the {{assassination}} of his father in 1002, Eckard II and his elder brother Herman I ruled over the Ekkeharding <b>allodial</b> <b>lands,</b> while the Meissen margravial title first passed to their uncle Gunzelin feuding with his nephews until his deposition in 1009. During the German-Polish War around the Lusatian and Milceni lands, the brothers were able to maintain the rule over the Meissen lands until fighting ended with the 1018 Peace of Bautzen.|$|R
50|$|The Capitulary of Quierzy was promulgated in June 877 by {{the emperor}} Charles the Bald, {{comprising}} {{a series of}} measures for safeguarding the administration of his realm during his second Italian expedition, as well as directions for his son Louis the Stammerer, who was entrusted with the government during his father's absence. A great concourse of lords was assembled to hear it read. In this document Charles took elaborate precautions against Louis the German, whom he {{had every reason to}} distrust. He forbids him to sojourn in certain palaces and in certain forests, and compels him to swear not to despoil his stepmother Richilde of her <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> and benefices.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{property}} ownership in common law jurisdictions is fee simple. In the United States, land {{is subject to}} eminent domain by federal, state and local government, and subject to the imposition of taxes by state and/or local governments, and there is thus no true <b>allodial</b> <b>land.</b> Some states within the US (notably, Nevada and Texas) have provisions for considering land allodial under state law and the term {{may be used in}} other circumstances. Land is [...] "held of the Crown" [...] in England and Wales and other jurisdictions in the Commonwealth realms. Some realms (such as Australia and Canada) recognize aboriginal title, a form of allodial title that does not originate from a Crown grant. Some land in the Orkney and Shetland Islands, known as udal land, is held in a manner akin to <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> in that these titles are not subject to the ultimate ownership of the Crown.|$|E
50|$|An allod (Old Low Franconian allōd ‘fully owned estate’, {{from all}} ‘full, entire’ and ōd ‘estate’, Medieval Latin allodium), also <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> or allodium, refers, {{in the law}} of the Middle Ages and early Modern Period and {{especially}} within the Holy Roman Empire, to a freehold estate in land over which the allodial landowner (allodiary) had full ownership and right of alienation.|$|E
50|$|His son and {{successor}} Adam Anton Siegfried {{established a}} fideicommiss or entailment in 1739 (the {{year of his}} death), including the Turjak lordship, the holding of Nadlischegg in Mokronog and the Turjak (or Auersperg) Palace in Ljubljana. He was succeeded by eldest son Adolf Engelbert Ignaz, who died in 1768. On 20 May 1769, the <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> ownership passed to his widow Elisabeth (nee Lichtenberg), while the fideicommiss went to his brother-in-law Josef Maria.|$|E
5000|$|In 1016, Hugh {{sold his}} rights over the Archdiocese of Narbonne. [...] In 1035, he sold certain <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> to his viscount, Berengar. [...] In January 1051, Hugh donated {{the church of}} Tribons to the abbey of Conques {{for the sake of}} his father's soul. He married Fides (also Fe or Foy), {{daughter}} of Wilfred II of Cerdanya, to whom he had sold the archdiocese in 1016. They had two daughters, the elder of which, Bertha, inherited Rouergue and Gévaudan, but lost suzerainty over the other territories to William IV of Toulouse. She married Robert II of Auvergne while her younger sister, Fides, married Bernard, Viscount of Narbonne.|$|R
50|$|After {{the sudden}} {{death of the}} emperor in 1197, Henry's younger brother Otto IV became one of two rival kings of the Holy Roman Empire. At first he {{supported}} him, but switched sides to Philip of Swabia in 1203. Having divided the Welf <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> with his brothers Otto and William of Winchester, Henry then ruled over the northern Saxon territories around Stade and Altencelle and also was confirmed as count palatine by King Philip. When the German throne quarrel ended with Philip's assassination in 1208, Henry again sided with Otto IV. In Imperial service, he tried to ward off the territorial claims by the Rhenish Prince-archbishops of Cologne, Trier and Mainz, though to no avail.|$|R
50|$|In 1142 the duchy {{passed to}} Henry the Lion, son of Henry the Proud. The {{struggle}} between Henry the Lion and Emperor Frederick I ended with Henry's loss {{of all his}} fiefs in 1180. The stem duchy was broken up into numerous fiefs. The Guelphic heirs of Henry the Lion retained only their <b>allodial</b> <b>lands,</b> the duchy of Brunswick. The ducal title of Saxony went to Bernhard of Anhalt, a younger son of Albert the Bear of Brandenburg {{and founder of the}} Ascanian line of Saxon dukes. Besides Anhalt, Bernard received Lauenburg and the country around Wittenberg, on the Elbe. These widely separate territories continued after 1260 under separate branches of the Ascanians as Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg.|$|R
50|$|Sometime before 993, when Borrell imprisoned Sendred, {{one of the}} archdeacons of Urgell, {{in order}} to extort from him an allod at Somont, Sal·la gained his release by {{claiming}} the alod belonged to the church. This appropriation of <b>allodial</b> <b>land</b> in Andorra was legitimised in 1003 in a charter issued by Sendred by which {{he and his wife}} Ermeriga and their heirs were to hold it in benefice from the Virgin, patron saint of the see of Urgell.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{at this time that}} the counts of Zollern were able to greatly {{increase}} their possessions in terms of both territory and castles in the southwestern parts of today's Germany, expanding to the Rhine, and lower Danube, as well as adding territory in Alsace and by the Neckar. All of these possessions were in the form of <b>allodial</b> <b>land.</b> Land held in feudal tenure was added to these outright possessions to form the ancestral territory of the counts of Zollern.|$|E
5000|$|Leibulf's origins are unknown, {{though the}} {{probability}} is high {{that he was}} a native of Provence where he held ex rebus proprietas (<b>allodial</b> <b>land)</b> in Arles. His rise to power occurred {{in the last years of}} the reign of Charlemagne (768 [...] - [...] 814), who may have granted him many of the honores he held. Along with Bera's Goths and Duke Sancho I's Gascons, he led a contingent of Provençals on Louis the Pious' expedition against Barcelona in 801 [...] - [...] 802.|$|E
50|$|Matilda was {{the elder}} {{daughter}} of Margrave Albert II of Brandenburg {{and his wife}} Matilda (Mechthild), a daughter of the Wettin margrave Conrad II of Lusatia. Albert's uncle Count Bernhard of Anhalt had received the Duchy of Saxony after the deposition of the Welf duke Henry the Lion in 1180 and Matilda's father, ruling the Margraviate of Brandenburg since 1205, initially had been a loyal supporter of the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty. However, upon the assassination of Philip of Swabia in 1208, he switched sides to the Welf rival King Otto IV. Upon his death in 1220, he was succeeded by Matilda's brothers, John and Otto III, who continued to support the Saxon Welfs {{in the struggle for}} their <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> around Brunswick.|$|R
50|$|According to a {{marginal}} notation to the Conversion that has by now {{been incorporated into}} its main text, Pribina's <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> were situated in Nitrava ultra Danuvium where Archbishop Adalram of Salzburg (821 - 836) consecrated a church, Since Nitrava has been identified, although not unanimously, with modern Nitra in Slovakia, Pribina is considered to have ruled the large early medieval fortress excavated at that town. The consecration {{of the church in}} Nitrava took place around 827, thus it was the first church in all Eastern Europe whose existence is documented in writing. That the church was consecrated for Pribina himself (who, all the same, still remained a catechumen), or for his wife cannot be decided. She {{seems to have been a}} member of the Bavarian Wilhelminer family.|$|R
5000|$|In {{this period}} of {{political}} confusion, the viscount Bernard Sunifred rebelled. His lands were clustered {{in the north of}} Cerdanya, in the Segre valley and Conflent with their centre at Merencs. He put his lands under the nominal suzerainty of the count of Toulouse and tried to draw them away from Cerdanya. Bernard was forced to make peace with Raymond in 1047 and his <b>allodial</b> <b>lands</b> were handed over, though he was compensated with more fiefdoms from the count. Bernard rebelled a second time and was forced to make peace again in 1061. The important pass of Pimorent, which, now that Cerdanya was no longer a marcher territory, lay at the centre of its existence, remained {{in the hands of the}} Count Raymond and neither of Bernard's allies of Toulouse or Foix.|$|R
