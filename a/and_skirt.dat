5|$|Beginning with Tandy in 1948 and {{continuing}} {{into the early}} 1950s, Nancy's appearance was updated to follow the current styles. In postwar opulence, a trend emerged for young adults {{to have their own}} casual style, instead of dressing in the same styles as more mature adults, and Nancy becomes less constrained. Sweater or blouse <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> ensembles, as well as a pageboy hairstyle, were introduced in 1948, and continued with new artist Bill Gillies, who updated 10 covers and illustrated three new jackets from 1950 to 1952. Gillies used his wife for a model, and Nancy reflects the conservative 1950s, with immaculately waved hair and a limited wardrobe– she wears similar sweater, blouse, <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> ensembles, in different combinations, on most of these covers. Gillies also designed the modern-era trademark as a spine symbol which was used for decades: Nancy's head in profile, looking through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket <b>and</b> <b>skirt,</b> with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch Johnny and murder him, then frame Nikki by putting his body {{into the trunk of}} her car. Nikki is sentenced to seven years in prison. This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Crawley buses feature a light blue base {{with a dark}} blue roof which swoops down at the front. It also has a white stripe separating the roof from the base, and a light blue lower dash panel. The Fastway livery is a silver base with navy blue cantrail panels and a navy blue lower front panel.

25|$|Haredi {{women wear}} blouses {{covering}} the elbow and collarbone, and skirts {{that cover the}} knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.|$|E
25|$|Unfitted gowns (called nightgowns in England) {{with long}} hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> and {{tied with a}} ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an {{embroidered}} jacket called a waistcoat and a contrasting embroidered petticoat, without a farthingale. Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Precht's {{body was}} {{pulled from the}} Ohio River on 29 November 2006. She was found wearing makeup and jewelry, {{including}} two necklaces of pearl-like beads that led to her nickname. She wore a black blouse <b>and</b> <b>skirt,</b> white socks, gray shoes, and tan nylon pantyhose. After an autopsy, {{it was concluded that}} she had been deceased for approximately two days; no suspicious signs were noted. The then-unidentified woman had suffered from arthritis in various parts of her body and had a fair complexion with hazel eyes. Examiners also discovered that she had very well-maintained teeth, as she had only one dental filling.|$|E

25|$|The mantua or manteau {{was a new}} {{fashion that}} arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> cut separately, the mantua hung from the {{shoulders}} to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's Banyan, worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline {{in contrast to the}} broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or eardrops worn since the 1630s remained popular.|$|E
25|$|After {{the western}} {{economic}} {{boom of the}} mid-'80s, the younger generation had a decreased influence in fashion as they had less of {{an impact on the}} market. The main consumer became the older generations that were more financially stable and were influenced by international political news. Thatcherism were promoted in the UK by the British Conservative Party. Leader of the British conservative party, Margaret Thatcher, in her power suit quickly {{became one of the most}} well-known symbol in the 1980s. Suits worn by Margaret Thatcher were usually single color toned with a matching hat, jacket <b>and</b> <b>skirt,</b> that ends below the knee. A wide shoulder cutting and pearl necklace was also part of her regular attire. Her political style was straightforward, effective and sometimes criticized as not empathetic enough. But there is no doubt that her appearance portrayed her ability, power and authority, which is what a lot of working women at that era desired.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because {{they do not want to}} be put in a position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E

25|$|Two {{important}} staples in {{the diet}} are seafood and beef, the latter playing {{a larger role in}} the cuisine of Sonora than in the rest of Mexico. Beef is often cooked over an open flame, and Sonorans prefer robust cuts such as brisket <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> steak. Machaca, or carne seca, is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by Angus, Herefords and Holsteins. Dishes based on or usually containing beef include carne desebrada, carne con rajas verdes, burritos, carne con chile colorado, beef chorizo, carne seca, machaca, menudo, gorditas and meatballs. Seafood is an important staple, especially along the coast as there is a large variety of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of California. Seafood is generally cooked in very simple dishes, such as fish tacos, seafood soups, rice with shrimp or squid and shrimp meatballs. Favored fish include cabrilla, flounder, marlin, sardines, manta rays and various types of jacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{streets are}} fairly wide and straight, {{and many of}} the houses {{belonging}} to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from Al-Andalus by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in Hispano-Moresque designs, such as are found in the Alhambra of Granada, and the tile-work for which Tetuan is known may be seen on floors, pillars and dados. The traditional industries are tilework, inlaying with silver wire, and the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as cape <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> by Arabic girls in rural areas. The Jews lived in a mellah, separated {{from the rest of the}} town by gates which were closed at night. The harbour of Tetuan was obstructed by a bar, over which only small vessels can pass, and the roadstead, sheltered to the north, Northwest and south, is exposed to the east, and is at times unsafe in consequence of the strong Levanter.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent {{a long period of time}} in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E

500|$|Wolfe {{believed}} {{that if he had}} written the episode later in the series he would have concentrated more on the established characters and less on Q and Vash. De Lancie felt that the episode never explained Q's motivation for wanting to stay with Vash. [...] "I think Q is best used when he deals with large philosophical issues, <b>and</b> <b>skirt</b> chasing just isn't one of them", he said. Because certain aspects of Q's character are left unexplored, De Lancie found that [...] "the style, the quips and the panache in which things are done become very important".|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} winter, the Cheyenne camp on Powder River was {{attacked}} and destroyed; however, most of the Indians escaped. [...] Because they now had no possessions during winter, the Cheyenne moved to join their allies, the Ogallala Sioux, led by Crazy Horse. [...] Together they moved north-east to Chalk Butte to join the Uncpapa Sioux, led by Sitting Bull. [...] At some point the Minneconjoux Sioux under Lame Deer also joined the group. [...] The Indians had to continually move their camp to find enough game and grazing for {{the large numbers of}} people and horses. [...] The Arrows all Gone Sioux then joined, and then the Blackfeet Sioux. [...] Small groups of other tribes, such as the Waist <b>and</b> <b>Skirt</b> Indians, the Assiniboines, and Burned Thigh Sioux also joined. [...] Even Chief Lame White Man was there {{with a small group of}} Southern Cheyenne.|$|E
