Both clips were shot by Edward Aninaru at Venice Beach in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced supply shortages when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names was exhausted.|$|E
5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} the companion of Sirius to be about half a century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, the U.S. {{ratified}} the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election {{to a third}} term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> elected president. The latter clause would have applied to Truman's situation in 1952 except that a grandfather clause in the amendment explicitly excluded the amendment from applying to the incumbent president.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ma {{recovered}} {{more than}} 1,200 Warring States period bamboo slips from the Kingdom of Chu, {{now known as}} the Shanghai Museum bamboo slips.

5|$|In April–May 2012, {{a team of}} archaeologists {{unearthed}} <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> unknown {{inscription on}} a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on {{what is known as}} Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k'atuns with the future completion of the 13th b'ak'tun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.|$|E
5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the previously known steroid compounds ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol acetate and ergosta-4,6,8-(14),22-tetraene-3-one, three unique triterpenes—derivatives of 3-hydroxy-lanostane—have been isolated from fruit bodies of A.hygrometricus. The compounds, named astrahygrol, 3-epi-astrahygrol, and astrahygrone (3-oxo-25S-lanost-8-eno-26,22-lactone), have δ-lactone (a six-membered ring) in the side chain—a chemical feature previously unknown in the Basidiomycetes. <b>A</b> <b>previously</b> unknown steryl ester (3β, 5α-dihydroxy-(22E, 24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-6α-yl palmitate) has been isolated from mycelia grown in liquid culture. The compound has a polyhydroxylated ergostane-type nucleus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of <b>a</b> <b>previously</b> unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada.

All of these animals had bled to death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the portion of}} NY321 south of Forward Road was co-designated as part of NY20SY, a largely {{alternate}} routing of US20 between Skaneateles and Manlius via Syracuse.
