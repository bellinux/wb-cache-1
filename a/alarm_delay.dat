Methods: Occlusion challenge tests were mainly performed as bench experiments of four kinds of multiple parallel infu-sions (10 ml/h and 50 ml/h infusions), which were connected at the proximal or distal portion of ARV, with or without ASV. Alarm threshold was set to 1000 mmHg. Occlusion alarm delays and the compliances of the infusion systems were compared among groups. Results: Without ASV, compared to 10 ml/h infusion alone distal to anti-reflux valve, 50 ml/h infusion distal to anti-reflux valve reduced the mean <b>alarm</b> <b>delay</b> from 416 ± 7 s to 81 ± 3 s (P < 0. 001). Compared to 50 ml/h infusion alone, combined 10 ml/h and 50 ml/h infusion distal to ARV prolonged the <b>alarm</b> <b>delay</b> from 81 ± 3 s to 133 ± 6 s (P < 0. 001). However, combined infusions distal to ARV with ASV significantly reduced the <b>alarm</b> <b>delay</b> from 133 ± 6 s to 74 ± 5 s (P < 0. 001), and also reduced the compliance of the infusion system from 2. 31 ± 0. 12 to 1. 20 ± 0. 08 μl/mmHg (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The infusion setup of faster infusion rate, lower compliant system using ASV could effectively decrease oc-clusion <b>alarm</b> <b>delay</b> during multiple intravenous parallel infusions using ARV.

40|$|A {{decision}} maker records measurements of a finite-state Markov chain corrupted by noise. The {{goal is to}} decide when the Markov chain hits a specific target state. The {{decision maker}} can choose from a finite set of sampling intervals to pick the next {{time to look at}} the Markov chain. The aim is to optimize an objective comprising of false <b>alarm,</b> <b>delay</b> cost and cumulative measurement sampling cost. Taking more frequent measurements yields accurate estimates but incurs a higher measurement cost. Making an erroneous decision too soon incurs a false alarm penalty. Waiting too long to declare the target state incurs a delay penalty. What is the optimal sequential strategy for the decision maker? The paper shows that under reasonable conditions, the optimal strategy has the following intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate (posterior distribution) of the Markov chain is away from the target state, look less frequently; while if the posterior is close to the target state, look more frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal strategy. Also the achievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as a function of transition dynamics and observation distribution is analyzed. The sensitivity of the optimal achievable cost to parameter variations is bounded in terms of the Kullback divergence. To prove the results in this paper, novel stochastic dominance results on the Bayesian filtering recursion are derived. The formulation in this paper generalizes quickest time change detection to consider optimal sampling and also yields useful results in sensor scheduling (active sensing) ...|$|E

The variable life-adjusted display (VLAD) provides a directly interpretable assessment indicating whether the overall performance is better or worse than expected {{on the basis of}} the predicted risk of failure. The aim of this study is to quantify the ability of VLAD charts to early recognize a worsening in clinical performance. METHODS: A Monte Carlo experiment simulating the sequence of successes and failures of an intensive care unit is performed; the predicted mortality is calculated by means of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 admission score. From a given position in the admissions sequence, we increased the probability of death; we calculated: (i) the surveillance system delay in responding to the mortality increase; (ii) the percentage of cases where the VLAD has been able to give an alarm within the first 5, 10, 20 and 60 deaths occurred after the increase of probability of death; and (iii) the percentage of false declarations of increase (anticipated alarms). RESULTS: The frequency distribution of the <b>alarm</b> <b>delays</b> shows VLAD was not always able to early detect mortality increase. Only a very small number of anticipated alarms were given. CONCLUSIONS: Variable life-adjusted display ability to signal is mild and strictly correlated with the institution volume of activity.

40|$|Fault {{management}} is a challenging task in all-optical {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) networks. However, fast fault localization for shared risk link groups (SRLGs) with multiple links is essential for building a fully survival and functional transparent all-optical mesh network. Monitoring trail (m-trail) technology is an effective approach to achieve the goal, whereby a set of m-trails are derived for unambiguous fault localization (UFL). However, an m-trail traverses through a link by utilizing a dedicated wavelength channel (WL), causing {{a significant amount of}} resource consumption. In addition, existing m-trail methods incur long and variable <b>alarm</b> dissemination <b>delay.</b> We introduce a novel framework of real-time fault localization in all-optical WDM mesh networks, called the monitoring-burst (m-burst), which aims at initiating a balanced trade-off between consumed monitoring resources and fault localization latency. The m-burst framework has a single monitoring node (MN) and requires one WL in each unidirectional link if the link is traversed by any m-trail. The MN launches short duration optical bursts periodically along each m-trail to probe the links of the m-trail. Bursts along different m-trails are kept non-overlapping through each unidirectional link by scheduling burst launching times from the MN and multiplexing multiple bursts, if any, traversing the link. Thus, the MN can unambiguously localize the failed links by identifying the lost bursts without incurring any <b>alarm</b> dissemination <b>delay.</b> We have proposed several novel m-trail allocation, burst launching time scheduling, and node switch fabric configuration schemes. Numerical results show that the schemes, when deployed in the m-burst framework, are able to localize single-link and multi-link SRLG faults unambiguously, with reasonable fault localization latency, by using at most one WL in each unidirectional link. To reduce the fault localization latency further, we also introduce a novel methodology called nested m-trails. At first, mesh networks are decomposed into cycles and trails. Each cycle (trail) is realized as an independent virtual ring (linear) network using a separate pair of WLs (one WL in each direction) in each undirected link traversed by the cycle (trail). Then, sets of m-trails, i. e., nested m-trails, derived in each virtual network are deployed independently in the m-burst framework for ring (linear) networks. As a result, the fault localization latency is reduced significantly. Moreover, the application of nested m-trails in adaptive probing also reduces the number of sequential probes significantly. Therefore, practical deployment of adaptive probing is now possible. However, the WL consumption of the nested m-trail technique is not limited by one WL per unidirectional link. Thus, further investigation is needed to reduce the WL consumption of the technique. 1 yea...|$|R
40|$|The aim is {{to detect}} an {{influenza}} outbreak as soon as possible. Data are weekly reports of number of patients showing influenza-like symptoms. At each additional observation we decide whether a change has occurred or not. The methodology of statistical surveillance is used to construct an outbreak detection system. The report also demonstrates measures that reflect timeliness, such as the probability of successful detection within a specified time and the predictive value at different time points. A new non-parametric approach is used. The cycles are estimated using only monotonicity restrictions. Also different approaches regarding {{the intensity of the}} change-process are compared. The pros and cons of using an empirical intensity are evaluated. The time to an alarm is investigated, both for false and motivated alarms. When setting the alarm limit, there is a trade-off between the false <b>alarms</b> and the <b>delay</b> of motivated <b>alarms.</b> In the evaluation it must be considered that the performance of the system depends on when the outbreak begins, in relation {{to the start of the}} surveillance. If the outbreak begins at the same time as the surveillance is started, then the probability of early detection is 0. 04, but if the surveillance is started 12 time points before the outbreak the detection probability is 0. 43. The non-parametric approach avoids miss-specifications of the base line. Even a "normal" miss-specification results in serious delay. Another drawback is that alarms at late time points have low predictive value. An empirical prior for the intensity works well when the actual outbreak time agrees with the prior.

During the event monitoring, a sleep scheduling is taken to prolong the lifetime of WSN, which causes significant transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a sleep scheduling to greatly reduce the <b>alarm</b> broadcasting <b>delay</b> in WSNs. A nice feature of our proposed scheme is that the broadcasting delay is irrelative to the number of nodes in WSN, and the upper bound of it is just 3 D/ 2 + 2 L, where D is the maximal diameter hop of the network and L is the length of sleeping duty cycle, the unit is the length of time slot t set according to the quality of wireless links. As each node only needs to wake up for no more than t in each duty cycle, the proposed sleep scheduling has an ultra low energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed scheme can work well in unreliable wireless communication environment with enlarging the size of t to allow sensor nodes retransmit several times when there is failure. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed sleep scheduling, and experiments with 64 MicaZ sensor nodes are also made to validate the proposed scheme in real wireless communication environment...|$|R

We study women in mammography waiting rooms to test how the information-gathering experience influences intentions regarding their next scheduled mammogram. In particular, we investigate how a patient's "false alarm" result on one occasion (i. e., a mammogram's indication that cancer is present when a `more accurate' follow-up test reveals it is not) affects willingness to get a regularly scheduled mammogram the next time it is due. We adapt the normative value of information framework by hypothesizing that stress may moderate reactions to a false positive test result. Study 1 demonstrates that a false <b>alarm</b> can <b>delay</b> planned testing adherence but only when that false alarm test result has no implications about the likelihood of future cancer. For patients receiving a false alarm result, information providing either problem-focused coping support by stressing the patient's control or emotion-focused coping support by stressing the frequency of false alarm results mitigates negative future adherence effects. These reactions to false alarm results are moderated by stress, a finding that is developed in Study 2 where we show that stress alters patients' assessments of the utilities associated with testing outcomes. Study 3 shows that, {{in the presence of a}} false alarm result, women with actual false alarm history who experience stress are more likely to delay their next mammogram whereas women without actual false alarm history who experience stress are less likely to delay their next mammogram.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we present an {{algorithm}} for online detection of change points in the response of an array of metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors deployed in an open sampling system. True change points occur due {{to changes in the}} emission modality of the gas source. The main challenge for change point detection in an open sampling system is the chaotic nature of gas dispersion, which causes fluctuations in the sensor response that are not related to changes in the gas source. These fluctuations should not be considered change points in the sensor response. The presented algorithm is derived from the well known Generalized Likelihood Ratio algorithm and it is used both on the output of a single sensor as well on the output of two or more sensors on the array. The algorithm is evaluated with an experimental setup where a gas source changes in intensity, compound, or mixture ratio. The performance measures considered are the detection rate, the number of false <b>alarms</b> and the <b>delay</b> of detection. I...|$|R

But such systems {{in many situations}} present multiple interacting faults. For example, individual sensors in a network may fail and detection is performed by comparing measurements between sensors, resulting in statistical dependency among faults. We present a new formulation for multiple interacting faults in a distributed system. The formulation includes specifications of how individual subsystems composing the large system may fail, the {{information that can be}} shared among these subsystems and the interaction pattern between faults. We then specify a new sequential algorithm for detecting these faults. The main feature of the algorithm is that it uses composite stopping rules for a subsystem that depend on the decision of other subsystems. We provide asymptotic false <b>alarm</b> and detection <b>delay</b> analysis for this algorithm in the Bayesian setting and show that under certain conditions the algorithm is optimal.

The methodology implemented notifies that the nodes which are not participating in multi-path routing generates an <b>alarm</b> message during <b>delay</b> and then detects and isolate the malicious node from network. We also notice that not only the same kind of attacks but also the same kind of countermeasures can appear in multiple layer. For example, misbehavior detection techniques can be applied to almost all the layers we discussed...|$|R
40|$|Student pilots {{participated in}} a series of four {{experiments}} to examine conflict alerting systems to augment the cockpit display of traffic information in a dual task context. At issue was the nature of task management and task switching, and how this was influenced by the modality of the alert, the level of resolution of the alert (likelihood 3 -stage vs. binary 2 -stage), the threshold setting of the alert, {{and the nature of the}} concurrent task (tracking or a navigational computational task). Across all four experiments the binary alert was generally more effective than the likelihood alert, and the auditory alert generally supported better conflict detection response than did the visual alert. However the impact of modality on the concurrent task was modulated by the nature of that task (visual tracking was more disrupted by the auditory alert, than was visually mediated communications). Variation of alert threshold between experiments indicated that false <b>alarm</b> prone automation <b>delayed</b> response to the alert, whereas miss-prone automation degraded the concurrent task. The results are interpreted in the context of theories of task management and task switching and multiple resources, and of the reliance-compliance theory of automation dependence. ...|$|R
