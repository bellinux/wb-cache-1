I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Connolly's The Big Yin {{nickname}} {{was first}} used during his adolescent years to differentiate between himself and his father. [...] "My father {{was a very strong}} man. Broad and strong. He had an 18½-inch neck collar. Huge, like a bull. He was [...] "Big Billy" [...] and I was [...] "Wee Billy". <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> bigger than him, and the whole thing got out of control. And then I became The Big Yin in Scotland. So, we'd go into the pub and someone would say, 'Billy Connolly was in.' 'Oh? Big Billy or Wee Billy?' 'The Big Yin.' 'Oh, Wee Billy.' If you were a stranger, you'd think, 'What are these people talking about?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then I began to wonder if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>got</b> it. <b>I</b> {{suppose it}} was fatigue that had made me so slow to apprehend the nub.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as easy," [...] he smiled. [...] "I {{used to be}} stumped by that {{proposition}} myself, after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{my memory}} back. Now how in Sam Hill--' I used to begin, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> spend hours figuring at it. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the answer <b>I</b> felt downright idiotic, it was that easy." [...] He paused, then announced: [...] "They didn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came as deck-hand {{on board}} a barque {{bringing}} tomato boxes over. They were busy at the coaling wharf just <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> put on. You know the rest of it. I was left forty thousand dollars." ...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty. [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long," [...] recalled Rodriguez, [...] "I said, 'We've got to be there first.'

2500|$|Norris {{said the}} {{campaign}} had grown {{much bigger than}} she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. [...] "I {{just want to go}} back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at The Washington Post. Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. [...] "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," [...] he wrote. [...] "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out." [...] Norris acknowledged, [...] "I said that I wanted to counter fear <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> afraid." [...] On April 29, Norris suggested that [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] be called off: [...] "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights." [...] On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe Bronson {{nodded and}} glanced curiously about him before answering: [...] "Yes; I think the bay life will suit {{me for a}} while, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> 've <b>got</b> used to it, I 'm going to sea in the forecastle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another niece, Marge Follett, {{came to the}} 2003 All-Star Game at the White Sox park to {{personally}} appeal to the commissioner for her uncle's reinstatement. The Tribune reported a quote from Weaver: [...] "There are murderers who serve a sentence <b>and</b> <b>then</b> get out. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Graham Barrow {{was the man}} {{in charge}} of the Latics at the time and he said: [...] "It was just devastating. I gave the players the {{afternoon}} off <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>got</b> a call at teatime to tell me that Michael had been killed outright.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} {{interval}} of silence, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{up and went to}} the fireplace where the bacon and sausages stood upon a trivet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say. I thought I {{would go}} and tell you. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> anxious about her, and knocked at her door, {{and looked into the}} room. Gone! Gone!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody told me,--in {{the usual}} {{sense of the}} word. I presumed that {{something}} was the matter, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it out from Marie. Why had you not told me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly <b>I</b> toiled on, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{near her}} {{and was just}} about to execute my plan, she started nimbly away, with a merry laugh, and never paused again until the summit was reached. Thoroughly tired and beaten, I sat down to rest; but {{presently}} looking up I saw her at the top, standing motionless on a stone, looking like a statue outlined against the clear blue sky. Once more <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up and pressed on until <b>I</b> reached her, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sank down on the grass, overcome with fatigue.|$|R
5000|$|... "My first {{semester}} in college all I did was whack {{the side of}} my arm, you know, so <b>I</b> was bruised. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> better, <b>I</b> could shoot really good in practice, but we’d get to tournaments and I’d be so scared at the beginning and I’d get so far behind that maybe I’d finish third or fourth. Sometimes second, but I never shot good enough at the beginning to actually win anything. But through practice, and John convincing me that I was better than I thought I was, I finally learned how to win." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{all had a}} hand in it," [...] {{answered}} the senator's son. [...] "Dave gave him the first dose of shot, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Phil <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in our work. It was a hard job to kill him, I can tell you," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Roger told of how the wounded beast had fallen down among the horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] He hoisted {{it on to}} the vehicle, {{which was}} a sort of car, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{forgot all}} about it till I was left alone in this place, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it out, an' God in his marcy made it like a light in the dark to me.|$|E
60|$|Miss Murdstone {{was good}} enough to {{take me out to the}} cart, and to say on the way that she hoped I would repent, before I came to a bad end; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into the cart, and the lazy horse walked off with it.|$|E
5000|$|Asked in February 2012 why {{the three}} {{former members of}} Trouble decided to form The Skull, bassist Ron Holzner replied, [...] "The Trouble set at last year's Days of the Doomed Fest Kenosha, Wisconsin was the {{catalyst}} for this whole thing. Eric and Oly hadn't {{had the chance to}} talk much before festival, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there the next day and we all got to hang out and talk... it was really nice! Playing [...] "End of My Daze" [...] with the whole f---ing crowd singing... that's what it's all about! We all looked at each other on stage and simply went, 'Wow!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Before that I only {{played two}} or max three ELO tournaments per year. Between 2001 and 2004 I had {{problems}} to reach my normal playing strength during the tournaments since I was too rusty all the time. I always started the tournaments bad <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> warm <b>and</b> recovered, the tournament {{was over and}} it was a half year left to the next one. I had 2400 in 2001 and in 2004 I had 2360 after losing five ELO points in almost every tournament that I played during this period. Therefore I decided to activate myself and start to play more and a bit more serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When I {{was a young}} lad, [...] My fortune was bad, [...] If ere I do well 'tis a wonder. [...] I {{spent all}} my means [...] Amid sharpers <b>and</b> queans; [...] <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a {{commission}} to plunder. [...] I have stockings 'tis true, [...] But the devil a shoe, [...] I am forced to wear boots in all weather, [...] Be d----d the hoot sole, [...] Curse on the spur-roll. [...] Confounded be the upper-leather.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{beat the}} fire {{up to the}} cabin, that's all. Buell's horse can run some. I cut the men loose, and we made up across the ridge, got lost, {{surrounded}} by fire, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> Herky to help me start a back-fire in that big canyon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{just one}} moment I wished I {{was back in the}} old Vallambrosa, {{starving}} and hoping. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> numb, and didn't care. And then I felt that somebody else was in the water close by me, holding me up. He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{a sample}} of Mulligan Jacobs. The venom of hatred I had already seen in his face was as nothing {{compared}} with what now was manifested.

6000|$|... 'Well, sir,' said Mr. Loth-to-stoop, 'I {{have one}} thing more to propound, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> am <b>got</b> {{to the end of}} my commission.

6000|$|He mused {{again as}} if recalling his struggles.

Of course, there wasn't {{anything}} for a grass-cutter like me {{to do in the}} hills but swing a pick. I didn't like underground work, and so I went on a ranch again. Well, I kept tryin' the minin' game off and on, prospectin' here and there, and finally <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into this leasin' business, and two years ago I secured a lease on the 'Red Cent' and struck it good and plenty. Oh, I don't intend to say it's any Portland--but it pays me and I've been stackin' up some few dollars down at the Commercial Bank, and feelin' easy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Got my name pat, haven't you? I've been {{supporting}} {{myself for}} eight years. I was a cash {{girl and a}} wrapper and then a shop girl until I was grown, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to be a suit model. Mr. Texas Man, don't you think a little wine would make this dinner a little less dry?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would listen}} to a stormy sea of babblement, and try to extract some {{constructive}} intimations. Every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a whiff of politics.

6000|$|... "I had {{forgotten}} entirely about the 'Squire and Professor Hawk, until I saw Cheeko {{running along the}} ground toward where three or four walnuts were lying near a clump of fir bushes, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> right up on my hind legs and shouted to him that he'd best keep under cover {{if he wanted to}} save his skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! I am so glad," [...] she cried. [...] "You know, I {{have had}} qualms.

5000|$|Simms {{joined the}} local Boston Musicians Union {{in the early}} 40's and {{remained}} active in it until her death, of that experience she said: [...] "It did give me the advantage of earning a decent wage.

It really made a difference in my life." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1849-50, Courbet painted Stone-Breakers (destroyed in the Allied Bombing of Dresden in 1945), which Proudhon admired as an icon {{of peasant}} life; it has been called [...] "the first of his great works". The {{painting}} {{was inspired by a}} scene Courbet witnessed on the roadside. He later explained to Champfleury and the writer Francis Wey: [...] "It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty <b>and</b> so, right <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the idea for a painting. I told them to come to my studio the next morning." ...|$|R
