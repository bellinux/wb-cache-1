50|$|Nuisance {{wildlife}} management {{is the term}} given {{to the process of}} selective removal of problem individuals or populations of specific species of wildlife. Other terms for the field, include wildlife damage management, wildlife control, and <b>animal</b> <b>damage</b> control to name a few. Some species of wildlife may become habituated to man's presence, causing property damage or risking transfer of disease to humans or pets (zoonosis). Many wildlife species coexist with humans very successfully, such as commensal rodents which have become more or less dependent on humans.|$|E
50|$|Heart rot {{is caused}} by fungi {{entering}} {{the trunk of the}} tree through wounds in the bark. These wounds are areas of the tree where bare wood is exposed and usually a result of improper pruning, fire damage, dead branches, insects or even <b>animal</b> <b>damage.</b> The fungal spores enter the exposed wounds, germinate within the wood tissues and slowly ingest the heartwood. The infection is a very slow process and can take from months to years, depending on conditions and tree health. An average fungus will advance in the heartwood by 6-8 centimeters per year, and extensive development in the wood tissue is needed before mushrooms or conks are produced.|$|E
50|$|The National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) {{is devoted}} to resolving {{problems}} caused by the interaction of wild animals and society. NWRC applies scientific expertise to develop practical methods to resolve these problems and to maintain the quality of environments shared with wildlife.

NWRC scientists study birds, mammalian predators, rodents, and other wildlife that cause serious, but localized, damage problems. It conducts studies {{to ensure that the}} methods developed are biologically sound, effective, safe, economical, and socially responsible. NWRC scientists produce the appropriate methods, technology, and materials for reducing <b>animal</b> <b>damage.</b> Through the publication of results and the exchange of technical information, NWRC provides valuable data and expertise to the public and the scientific community, as well as to APHIS's Wildlife Services program.|$|E

In 1907, under political pressure from the western cattle and livestock industries, this agency began a concerted program which eventually was called: <b>Animal</b> <b>Damage</b> Control. This predator control program alone killed 1,800 wolves and 23,000 coyotes in 39 U.S. National Forests in 1907.

50|$|For a cricket net, the netting is {{the most}} {{important}} component. The net is usually manufactured in a synthetic polymer such as polyethylene, this is a hard wearing and relatively economic material. Prior to the mid-1990s nets were often made from nylon, however after the significant spikes in crude oil prices it was no longer viable to use nylon. The net will be black in colour or occasionally green. The mesh size of the net will be 50mm and will commonly have a twine diameter ranging from 1.8mm - 3.0mm. Cricket nets are supplied from a knotless or knotted netting - {{as a rule of thumb}} knotted nets are considered to be superior. It is important to understand that twine thickness of knotted and knotless nets are not directly comparable as breaking strengths of knotted nets are higher than knotless. A good standard cricket net will be UV stabilised and rot proof. For people who construct their own cricket cage, the netting is the only component which they need to purchase from a specialist supplier. Cricket netting is seamed at the edges to stop netting fraying. These seams are usually a 6mm cord sewn into the netting where it meets a cage or end. Canvas blinkers can be added to offer privacy and to reduce net wear. Also partial canvas skirts of 0.5m (at the lower portion of the netting) are added to prevent <b>animal</b> <b>damage</b> at night from creatures walking into netting and chewing out of it.|$|E

50|$|Hypoxylon canker greatly {{depends on}} dying tree matter, {{which is why}} it {{generally}} attacks only damaged and stressed trees. Normal, healthy trees are able to fend of infection with their natural defense mechanisms such as basal defense and hypersensitive response (2). Furthermore, it is known that the Hypoxylon fungi already exist on the majority of trees and are only waiting for a possible infection route to be created. When damage or stress occurs, the fungi will further colonize, infect, and begin living off the nutrients of the tree, flourishing in the bark and vascular system (2). Natural stresses such as defoliation by insects, <b>animal</b> <b>damage,</b> soil nutrient depletions, drought, overcrowding, and other disease can weaken trees, enabling Hypoxylon to infect (9). Human-caused problems can also lead to infection; soil compaction and excavation, construction, and physical injuries are known stresses to trees (9). Drought {{is one of the major}} indicators that Hypoxylon will become a problem in the following months to years. Droughts account for a large majority of tree-related problems as the water deficit has a negative effect on the tree’s natural developments (9). Symptoms usually develop within a year after a drought, but with extreme conditions can develop in a matter of months. (4). A major factor in the survival of Hypoxylon canker is the moisture content within the tree wood. When the stresses mentioned above begin to weaken the tree, moisture content of the wood decreases. As the wood further dries, the Hypoxylon fungi will feed and further white rot and decay of the tree will occur, potentially causing death (9).|$|E
50|$|Prominent {{themes of}} the second book include {{agriculture}} as man's struggle against a hostile natural world, often described in violent terms, and the ages of Saturn and Jupiter. Like the first book, {{it begins with a}} poem addressing the divinities associated with the matters about to be discussed: viticulture, trees, and the olive. In the next hundred lines Virgil treats forest and fruit trees. Their propagation and growth are described in detail, with a contrast drawn between methods that are natural and those that require human intervention. Three sections on grafting are of particular interest: presented as marvels of man’s alteration of nature, many of the examples Virgil gives are unlikely or impossible. Also included is a catalogue of the world's trees, set forth in rapid succession, and other products of various lands. Perhaps the most famous passage of the poem, the Laudes Italiae or Praises of Italy, is introduced by way of a comparison with foreign marvels: despite all of those, no land is as praiseworthy as Italy. A point of cultural interest is a reference to Ascra in line 176, which an ancient reader would have known as the hometown of Hesiod. Next comes the care of vines, culminating in a vivid scene of their destruction by fire; then advice on when to plant vines, and therein the other famous passage of the second book, the Praises of Spring. These depict the growth and beauty that accompany spring's arrival. The poet then returns to didactic narrative with yet more on vines, emphasizing their fragility and laboriousness. A warning about <b>animal</b> <b>damage</b> provides occasion for an explanation of why goats are sacrificed to Bacchus. The olive tree is then presented in contrast to the vine: it requires little {{effort on the part of}} the farmer. The next subject, at last turning away from the vine, is other kinds of trees: those that produce fruit and those that have useful wood. Then Virgil again returns to grapevines, recalling the myth of the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs in a passage known as the Vituperation of Vines. The remainder of the book is devoted to extolling the simple country life over the corruptness of the city.|$|E
