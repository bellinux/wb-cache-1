5|$|From 1885 to 1893, the {{architect}} Helgo Zettervall (1831-1907) undertook comprehensive restoration work, seeking {{to give the}} cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he {{has been criticized for}} not respecting the building's original Baltic Gothic style. He also added pointed French spires to the towers, bringing the cathedral up to a height of , so making it <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was long. In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance, Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed ‘blind windows’ on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church.|$|E

25|$|Traditional folk music, {{having been}} in a slow decline from {{mainstream}} popularity since the 1970s, began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1990s, benefiting from the more general interest in World music. The arrival, and sometimes mainstream success, of acts like Kate Rusby, Nancy Kerr, Kathryn Tickell, Spiers and Boden, Seth Lakeman, Eliza Carthy, Runrig and Capercaillie, all largely concerned with acoustic performance of traditional material, marked a radical turn around in the fortunes of British folk music. This {{was reflected in the}} adoption creation of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000 and the profile for folk music was <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had been for over thirty years.|$|E
25|$|A popular {{demonstration}} {{involves the}} bounce of multiple stacked balls. If {{a tennis ball}} is stacked {{on top of a}} basketball, {{and the two of them}} are dropped at the same time, the tennis ball will bounce much higher than it would have if dropped on its own, even exceeding its original release height. The result is surprising as it apparently violates conservation of energy. However, upon closer inspection, the basketball does not bounce <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would have if the tennis ball had not been on top of it, and transferred some of its energy into the tennis ball, propelling it to a greater height.|$|E
25|$|Overall, between 1960 and 1989, {{the growth}} rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was {{slightly}} above the world average (based on 102 countries). According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union. Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin's despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|The Red Army was {{substantially}} motorized from 1939–1941 {{but lost}} most of its war equipment in Operation Barbarossa. These losses were temporarily remedied by forming masses of mounted infantry which were used as strike forces in the Battle of Moscow. Heavy casualties and a shortage of horses soon compelled the Soviets {{to reduce the number}} of cavalry divisions. As tank production and Allied supplies made up for the losses of 1941, the cavalry was merged with tank units, forming more effective strike groups. From 1943–1944, cavalry gradually became the mobile infantry component of the tank armies. By the end of the war, Soviet cavalry was reduced to its pre-war strength. The logistical role of horses in the Red Army was not <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was in the German Army due to Soviet domestic oil reserves and American truck supplies.|$|E

[...] Despite its lack of commercial success, Unknown is the most lamented of all science fiction and fantasy magazines; Lester del Rey describes it as having gained [...] "a devotion from its readers that no other magazine can match". [...] Edwards comments that Unknown [...] "appeared during Campbell's peak years as an editor; its reputation may stand <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> does partly because it died while still at its best".|$|E

500|$|Stereotypes {{of alcoholics}} are {{often found in}} fiction and popular culture. The [...] "town drunk" [...] is a stock {{character}} in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia, as in the fictional depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption. In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even {{an integral part of}} their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur. [...] They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.|$|E
500|$|Although Ensemble had {{to re-create}} all of Bungie's assets from scratch, Bungie had {{produced}} {{a large amount}} of reference material for the Halo film adaptation that the Halo Wars team used for inspiration. Another reference point was art from the Halo first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and Halo Wars takes place from a bird's-eye view, the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer Graeme Devine noted that the Warthog Jeep is [...] "actually jumping three times <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> does in Halo, and it goes four times faster than it does in Halo, and all these things—but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy." [...] To ensure artistic continuity between Halo Wars and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.|$|E
