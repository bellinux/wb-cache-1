Accelerating {{development}} of information technologies also causes {{the growth of}} computer crime which has the main goal to profit illegally, industrial espionage, forgery and falsification of data. Therefore, a demand for data security is needed more than ever. This paper describes a model which ensures effective detection of <b>authorized</b> and unauthorized <b>modification</b> of database scheme and data itself. At the moment when data modification becomes a criminal act, this model represents a foundation for forensic analysis of collected digital evidence.

40|$|Recently, Dziembowski et al. {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} non-malleable codes (NMC), inspired from the notion of non-malleability in cryptography {{and the work of}} Gennaro et al. in 2004 on tamper proof security. Informally, when using NMC, if an attacker modifies a codeword, decoding this modified codeword will return either the original message or a completely unrelated value. The definition of NMC is related to a family of <b>modifications</b> <b>authorized</b> to the attacker. In their paper, Dziembowski et al. propose a construction valid for the family of all bit-wise independent functions. In this article, we study the link between the second version of the Wire-Tap (WT) Channel, introduced by Ozarow and Wyner in 1984, and NMC. Using coset-coding, we describe a new construction for NMC w. r. t. a subset of the family of bit-wise independent functions. Our scheme is easier to build and more efficient than the one proposed by Dziembowski et al. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
40|$|High Plains Underground Water Conservation District # 1 for {{a number}} of years in their {{precipitation}} enhancement program. Convinced from past assessments that precipitation enhancement is a potential water management tool, the three boards decided that a program beginning in 2002, apart from the High Plains would be beneficial. The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) issued a permit on January 31, 2002 <b>authorizing</b> a weather <b>modification</b> program to conduct rainfall enhancement in Yoakum, Terry and Gaines County. Additionally, with the cooperation of the State of New Mexico, an area west of Gaines and Yoakum Counties is included in the target area. This precipitation enhancement program was named Southern Ogallala Aquifer Rainfall (SOAR) program. This document presents a brief summary of the SOAR 2003 annual report detailing an effort to systematically characterize the clouds, precipitation and the seeding effectiveness of the SOAR program. Independent evaluations show average rainfall increases of 68 % and 52 % in favor of a seeded cloud when compared to a matching control cloud.

500|$|In 1682, Massachusetts sent Dudley and John Richards to London {{as agents}} to {{represent}} its {{case to the}} Lords of Trade. [...] Dudley brought with him a letter of introduction from Plymouth Governor Thomas Hinckley to colonial secretary William Blathwayt. [...] The favorable relationship that he established with Blathwayt contributed to his future success as a colonial administrator, but it also raised suspicions in the colony about his motives and ability to represent the colony's interests. [...] The authority of the agents was limited, and the Lords of Trade insisted to the colonial administration that their agents be <b>authorized</b> to negotiate <b>modifications</b> to the colonial charter. [...] The legislature was dominated by hardliners and refused this demand, which led directly to the issuance of a quo warranto writ demanding the surrender of the colonial charter. [...] Dudley brought this news to Boston {{at the end of}} 1683, igniting a heated debate in the legislature—with the hardline party again prevailing. [...] The leadership of the hardliners included the influential Reverend Increase Mather, and they began to view moderates as enemies of the colony, including Dudley and Bradstreet. [...] Richards sided with the hardliners, and Dudley was removed from the council of assistants in the 1684 election.|$|R
40|$|The United States and Canada have {{historically}} struggled to delineate a maritime geographic boundary for the Gulf of Maine in the Atlantic Ocean. Running inland, from the Gulf of Maine, these countries not only share a boundary, but also dams on the St. Croix River system. For {{the past two}} decades, the St. Croix River system of Maine and New Brunswick has been {{the site of an}} increasing impasse between the United States and Canada concerning the management of fisheries resources. In 1995, this dispute culminated with the Maine legislature <b>authorizing</b> the <b>modification</b> of the Grand Falls Dam and the Woodland Dam on the St. Croix River to prevent the passage of alewives. Proponents of the bill argued that alewives were “eating machines” that killed and devoured “everything in a body of water. ” Since this time, constituents within the Maine legislature, the U. S. federal government, and the Canadian government have attempted to intervene and reverse the devastating effect that the legislation has had on the rapidly declining alewife population. The alewife, known in Canada as Gaspereau, is either a landlocked or an anadromous fish. Both types of alewives are indigenous to Maine and New Brunswick waters and this comment focuses on the native, anadromous alewives that formerly ran the waters of the St. Croix River. These fish are important to the Gulf of Maine ecosystem because they provide a source of food for large and smallmouth bass, brown trout, salmonids in freshwater; groundfish in the ocean and in estuaries; and for osprey and bald eagles. Additionally, both Maine and Canadian lobstermen depend on the alewife as bait during the spring lobster season. By preventing the passage of alewives into the St. Croix River, the Maine legislature has succeeded in preventing this species of fish from spawning. The practical effect of this has been to almost completely extinguish sea-run alewives from existence in the St. Croix River system. This Comment argues that the unilateral decision by the Maine legislature to prohibit alewives from swimming upstream into Canada, and thereby preventing the fish from spawning violates not only U. S. federal law, but also international law. This Comment maintains that, from a policy perspective, state legislatures should not be the arbiters of international fisheries management decisions because foreign relations are not matters for state interference. Scientific data and studies have revealed that the presence of anadromous alewives within the St. Croix River system would have no adverse effect on either the flora or the fauna, including other species of fish, such as the smallmouth bass and salmon. Without intervention, the Maine legislature may succeed in single-handedly causing the extinction of a native species of fish, from a designated body of water. Sadly, this Comment concludes that the Maine legislature is allowed to occupy the field in this instance, and make critical decisions regarding fisheries management, because neither the U. S. Congress nor the Canadian government has precluded it from doing so. Structurally, this Comment begins with a short introduction of the alewife and its history as a native fish in the St. Croix River system. Next, a discussion of the bill, An Act to Stop the Alewives Restoration Program in the St. Croix River, and its history will follow. Then, a discussion of possible legal theories and dispute resolution devices will be shown as either inapplicable or ineffective to stop the Maine legislature’s Bill. Finally, a short policy argument will advocate for either {{one or both of the}} U. S. or Canadian governments to enact new legislation that will prohibit a single state or province from unilaterally having the ability to enact fishery management legislation that would affect surrounding states, provinces, or countries...|$|R
