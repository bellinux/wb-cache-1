5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further <b>air</b> <b>bladder</b> in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the <b>air</b> <b>bladder</b> was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their bladders for both.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the gills}} of most teleost fish {{assist with the}} {{elimination}} of ammonia from the body and although fish virtually by definition live in an environment surrounded by water, most still have a distinct bladder for storing waste fluid. [...] The urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water, though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater ones. [...] Most fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary bladder except in its membranous nature. [...] The loaches, pilchards, and herrings are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed. [...] It is largest in those fish which lack an <b>air</b> <b>bladder,</b> and is situated {{in front of the}} oviducts and behind the rectum.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether a knee brace incorporating inflatable <b>air</b> <b>bladders</b> can alter the net peak external knee adduction moment in persons with medial compartment knee osteoarthritis.

Methods: Instrumented gait analysis was performed while subjects walked with and without the knee brace. When subjects wore the knee brace, the <b>air</b> <b>bladders</b> were either uninflated or inflated to 7 psi. The net external knee adduction moment was obtained by subtracting the abduction moment produced by the knee brace (estimated using a finite element analysis model) from the external knee adduction moment (estimated using a camera-based motion analysis system).

50|$|In {{pressure}} fuzed landmines this {{is achieved}} by having the fuze react differently based on {{the duration of the}} pressure impulse. For example, a number of Italian landmines like the VS-1.6 use an air system, where air is forced through a small hole into an <b>air</b> <b>bladder,</b> the inflation of which rotates a locking collar and releases the striker into the detonator. The sudden impulse from impact or explosion does not have sufficient duration to inflate the bladder and rotate the locking collar, whereas steady pressure from a vehicle's wheel or track does.|$|E
5000|$|The swim bladder, gas bladder, {{fish maw}} or <b>air</b> <b>bladder</b> is an {{internal}} gas-filled organ {{that contributes to}} the ability of many bony fish (but not cartilaginous fish) to control their buoyancy, and thus to stay at their current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming. [...] Also, the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume, allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent. Additionally, the swim bladder functions as a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound.|$|E
