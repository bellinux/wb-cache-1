But before I pass it, I will besides this give you an {{argument}} or two more for the further clearing of this, that {{the substance of the}} law delivered on Mount Sinai was, before that, delivered by the Lord to man in the garden. As, first, [...] "death reigned over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression"--that is, though they did not take the forbidden fruit as Adam did; but had the transgression been no other, or had their sin been laid to the charge of none but those that did eat of that fruit, then those that were born to Adam after he was shut out of the garden had not had sin, in that they did not actually eat of that fruit, and so had not been slaves to death; but, in that death did reign from Adam to Moses, of from the time of his transgression against the first giving of the law, till the time the law was given on Mount Sinai, it is evident that the substance of the Ten Commandments was given to Adam and his posterity under that command, [...] "Eat not of the tree that {{is in the midst of}} the garden." [...] But yet, if any shall say that it was because of the sin of their father that death reigned over them, to that I shall answer, that although original sin be laid to the charge of his posterity, yet it is also for their sins that they actually committed that they were plagued. And again, saith the Apostle, [...] "For where no law is, there is no transgression" [...] (Rom 4:15). For [...] "sin is not imputed when there is no law; nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses." [...] saith he (Rom 5:13,14). But if there had been no law, then there had been no transgression, and so no death to follow after as the wages thereof; for death is the wages of sin (Rom 6:23) and sin is the breach of the law; an <b>actual</b> <b>breach</b> in our particular persons, as well as an <b>actual</b> <b>breach</b> in our public person (1 John 3:4). 4 ...|$|E

50|$|Anticipatory Breach is an {{important}} aspect of the doctrine of repudiation. Anticipatory Breach occurs where one party repudiates their obligations under the contract prior to the time set to perform obligations. In response, an aggrieved party may, by accepting the repudiation, elect to terminate the contract and claim damages. However, in an instance where an aggrieved party chooses not to accept the repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, the contract will continue on food and the aggrieved party will have no right to damages unless and until an <b>actual</b> <b>breach</b> occurs.|$|E

50|$|A breach by anticipatory {{repudiation}} (or simply anticipatory breach) is an unequivocal {{indication that}} the party will not perform when performance is due, or {{a situation in which}} future non-performance is inevitable. An anticipatory breach gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place) For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15 A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of anticipatory breach is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an <b>actual</b> <b>breach</b> occurs.|$|E

However, though the moraine had a clear weak point, with lower elevation and erosion due to overflowing in the melting season, the sudden rupture of the moraine still needs to be explained. As moraines often contain an ice core, a possible cause could be the melting of the ice, inducing a progressive weakening of the structure. Geophysical investigations were therefore carried out in September 2006, including seismic refraction, GPR and resistivity. All methods worked well, but none revealed the presence of ice, though the depth to bedrock was determined. On the contrary, the moraine appeared to be highly saturated in water, especially in one area, away from the <b>actual</b> <b>breach</b> and corresponding to observed water seepage {{at the foot of the}} moraine.

40|$|Law and {{economics}} scholars {{have always had}} a strong interest in contract remedies. Perhaps the most explored issue in contract law has been the desirability of various contract remedies, such as expectation damages, specific performance, or liquidated damages, to name the most common. Scholars have been debating for years, from various perspectives, the comparative advantage of these remedies. Yet, most scholars have assumed that each of these remedies is exclusive, and their work has compared a single remedy contract to another single remedy contract. Interestingly, an analysis that assumes these remedies are optional (or cumulative) has not yet been explored, {{in spite of the fact}} that contract law provides the non-breaching party with a variety of optional remedies to choose from in case of a breach, and in spite of the fact that parties themselves write contracts which provide such an option. In this paper we attempt to start filling in this gap by studying the relationship between these remedies. Specifically, we study the conditions at which a contract that grants the non-breaching party an option to choose from optional remedies is superior to an exclusive remedy contract. We show that under conditions of double-sided uncertainty and asymmetric information between a seller (who might breach) and a buyer (who never breaches) the interaction of the parties 2 ̆ 7 distributions should determine whether a contract provides for exclusive or optional remedies. Specifically, if the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s conditional expected valuation is larger than the seller 2 ̆ 7 s conditional expected valuation (in both cases - conditional that their expected valuation is above the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s mean valuation), then a contract which provides the buyer an option to choose between liquidated damages or specific performance (or actual damages) is superior. Our analysis in this paper informs transactional lawyers of the relevant economic factors they should consider when deciding the optimal composition of remedies in a given context. Moreover, our analysis is relevant for courts that interpret contracts because it will help them to better understand whether rational parties would have agreed that a particular remedy would be an exclusive remedy or an optional remedy when the language of the contract is ambiguous. Lastly, our analysis provides yet another economic rationale for why courts should enforce parties 2 ̆ 7 liquidated damages clauses even if it seems ex-post over, or under, compensatory. We present a model which shows when parties will agree on a non-exclusive liquidated damages clause. Under such a contract the parties stipulate ex-ante that the buyer will have the option to choose upon breach whether she prefers an optional remedy, such as actual damages or specific performance, to the pre-determined liquidated damages. We focus on the ex-ante design of the contract in light of the new information that the parties anticipate they will gain after they draft the contract. Therefore, we assume that no renegotiation or investments are involved. We demonstrate the optimal way to design contract clauses which takes advantage of the information that the seller and the buyer receive between the time they enter into the contract and the time of the <b>actual</b> <b>breach.</b> We further suggest that parties indeed use such clauses and that courts honor them. After laying out the basic model we provide some extensions to it. As is well known, an exclusive liquidated damages contract is equivalent to granting the seller a call option to breach and pay, where the exercise price is equal to the amount of the agreed liquidated damages. What is perhaps less known is that a non-exclusive, or optional, contract, where the buyer can choose performance, is equivalent to giving the buyer a consecutive call option with the same exercise price. Yet, the consecutive call option to the buyer does not have to have the same exercise price but can rather have a higher one. We call this new contract a two-price contract and show that it is even more efficient than the basic contract we have explored before. Next, we introduce more rounds of sequential options and show that while the regular ex-ante contract can achieve on average about 4 Indeed, in an environment of asymmetric information renegotiation costs are high.

40|$|Dam failure {{mechanism}} produces the rapidly varied unsteady flow {{situation and the}} appropriate analysis to determine the flow condition is necessary. Over the world, more than 80, 000 dams were constructed. There {{have been more than}} 200 distinguished dam failures occurred within the twentieth century. The history of dam construction exists together with the probability of dam failure causing casualties and catastrophic situations. As climate change effect has caused the change in flow situations, the safety concern in the dam is also necessary. Casualties and damages due to dam break events depend upon the depth, flow velocity, population distribution as per geography and warning time related to the time to reach the peak flow to the downstream areas. Prediction of <b>actual</b> <b>breaching</b> scenario is not certain and is related to the geographical and geological features of the site, embankment type, type of breach, reservoir storage and flow conditions. Estimating the accurate breaching scenarios and modeling of the dam break situation to characterize the hydrodynamic risk is necessary. Among the numerous techniques of modeling dam break situation, this study focused on the use of HEC-RAS for analyzing the dam break situation. Most of the simulation of a dam break situation used one-dimensional analysis to solve flow conditions after the break of the dam. The Latest development of HEC-RAS 2 D capabilities is also used in conjunction with 1 D HEC-RAS dam break analysis to compare and explore both analysis capabilities of HEC-RAS. The effect of HEC-RAS simulation altering the breaching conditions is analyzed for the dam failure case of Big Bay dam located in Lamar County, Mississippi. The study area is chosen to obtain the simulation of piping dam failure, which was the real cause of the dam failure event. In addition, the overtopping failure parameters established by the different breaching regression equations were analyzed. Results obtained with both one- dimensional and two- dimensional analysis is compared along with the modeling procedure and concept of analysis. From the analysis, it is found that the time of peak water surface elevation and its magnitude is responsible in determining the extent of vulnerable areas to the dam break scenarios. The present study showed the variation in peak flow condition between different breach parameters. Breach bottom width found to be more sensitive parameters in dam failure events. HEC-RAS analysis is found to be suitable to predict the uncertain hydraulic behavior of dam break situation...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{aspects of}} Canadian and U. S. law related to {{liability}} and negligence of outdoor programs and suggests strategies for risk management. To prove negligence, an individual injured in an outdoor program must {{prove that the}} outdoor leader had a duty of care to the participant, standards of care were <b>breached,</b> <b>actual</b> injury was suffered, negligence was the proximate cause of injury, and the participant's position was not prejudiced. Court cases considering the criteria of customary standards of care within the profession of outdoor leadership have focused on specific areas of leadership responsibility: leader qualifications, outdoor navigation and guidance, group supervision, instruction in activity skills and safety, and provision of adequate safety measures. Outdoor leaders seek adequate risk to stimulate participants while avoiding likely accident-precipitating situations. Five {{ways to deal with}} rea...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the various powers {{which are available}} to the police in respect of <b>actual</b> or anticipated <b>breaches</b> of the peace, and then questions whether they are necessary. In most cases, it is argued, the common law power is uncertain in its scope, and carries the risk of inappropriate or disproportionate use. There is also duplication, in that the common law power is matched by equivalent statutory powers. Given that the statutory powers are more clearly defined, and {{may be subject to}} safeguards not present in the common law, it is suggested that it would be preferable to abolish the common law power. This could be done without significantly restricting the power of the police to deal with behaviour which involves violence, or which may provoke violenc...|$|R
40|$|A finite {{difference}} {{formulation of}} the shallow water equations using an upwind differencing method was developed maintaining computational efficiency and accuracy such {{that it can be}} used as a fast-response flood estimation tool. The model was validated using both laboratory controlled experiments and an <b>actual</b> dam <b>breach.</b> Through the laboratory experiments, the model was shown to give good estimations of depth and velocity when compared to the measured data, as well as when compared to a more complex two-dimensional model. Additionally, the model was compared to high water mark data obtained from the failure of the Taum Sauk dam. The simulated inundation extent agreed well with the observed extent, with the most notable differences resulting from the inability to model sediment transport. The results of these validation studies complex two-dimensional model. Additionally, the model was compared to high water mark data obtained from the failure of the Taum Sauk dam. The simulated inundation extent agreed well with the observed extent, with the most notable differences resulting from the inability to model sediment transport. The results of these validation studies show that a relatively numerical scheme used to solve the complete shallow water equations can be used to accurately estimate flood inundation. Future work will focus on further reducing the computation time needed to provide flood inundation estimates for fast-response analyses. This will be accomplished through the efficient use of multi-core, multi-processor computers coupled with an efficient domain-tracking algorithm, as well as an understanding of the impacts of grid resolution on model results...|$|R
