5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party is a day-long festival {{taking place}} {{annually}} in Austin, Texas since 1963. It typically occurs {{on the last}} Saturday of April in Austin's Pease District Park. It includes live music, food and drink vending which benefit local non-profit organizations, attendees in colorful costumes, and very large drum circles. The event is frequented by children and families, with specific events presented for them by the event organizers.

5|$|Falstaff {{had been}} of {{interest}} to Shakespearean commentators for years. Forty years earlier, a full-length book had appeared, An Essay on the Dramatic Character of Sir John Falstaff (1777), by Maurice Morgann, often taken {{as the beginning of}} that school of Shakespearean criticism which considers the characters of Shakespeare's plays as though they were real people. Hazlitt, who seems to have had little acquaintance with Morgann's work, is careful never to lose sight of Falstaff's status as <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> play—three plays, in fact, though the two parts of Henry IV are examined in a single essay.|$|E

5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more fitting for <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|The Chumscrubber is a 2005 American-German comedy-drama film, {{directed}} by Arie Posin, starring an ensemble cast led by Jamie Bell. The plot, written by Posin and Zac Stanford, {{focuses on the}} {{chain of events that}} follow the suicide of a teenage drug dealer in an idealistic but superficial town. Some of the themes addressed in the film are the lack of communication between teenagers and their parents and the inauthenticity of suburbia. The titular Chumscrubber is <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fictional video game that represents the town and its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. He would have liked to design <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

25|$|Prosthetics are used, in a {{narrative}} sense, to either, provide a plot {{point in the}} characters back-story, a plot point to give to character a disability (or more often in Science fiction, an advantage), or just to distinguish the character in some way. Having <b>a</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> story with a prostheses, can sometimes be {{the whole point of}} the story (e.g. Robocop is a full-body cyborg of police officer Alex Murphy, in essence he is a human/robot police officer, which is the basic premise for the film).|$|E
