It {{is more or}} less {{irregular}} and broken, but so nearly horizontal that, after some prolonged examination of the data I have collected about the Matterhorn, I am at this moment in doubt which is its top. For as, in order to examine the beds on its flanks, I walked up the Zmutt glacier, I saw that the line a b in Fig. 31 gradually lost its steepness; and about half-way up the glacier, the conjectural summit a then bearing nearly S. E. (forty degrees east of south), I found the contour was as in Fig. 32. In Fig. 33, I have given the contour as seen from Zermatt; and in all three, the same letters indicate the same points. In the Figures 32 and 33 I measured the angles with the greatest care,[61] from the base lines x y, which are accurately horizontal; and their general truth, irrespective of mere ruggedness, may be depended upon. Now in this flank view, Fig. 32, what was the summit at Zermatt, a, becomes quite subordinate, and the point b, far down the flank in Forbes's view taken from the Riffelhorn, is here the apparent summit. I was for some time in considerable doubt which of the appearances was most trustworthy; and believe now that they are both deceptive; for I found, on ascending the flank of the hills {{on the other side of}} the Valais, to a height of about five thousand feet above Brieg, between the Aletsch glacier and Bietschhorn; being thus high enough to get a view of the Matterhorn on something like distant terms of equality, up the St. Nicholas valley, it presented itself under the outline Fig. 34, which seems to be conclusive for the supremacy of the point e, between a and b in Fig. 33. But the impossibility of determining, at the foot of it, without a trigonometrical observation, which is the top of such an <b>apparent</b> <b>peak</b> as the Matterhorn, may serve to show the reader how little the eye is to be trusted for the verification of peaked outline.|$|E

However, analyses of fossil marine invertebrates {{have demonstrated that}} geological megabiases profoundly influence fossil preservation and discovery, obscuring true diversity signals. Comparable studies of vertebrate palaeodiversity patterns remain in their infancy. A new species-level dataset of Mesozoic marine tetrapod occurrences was compared with a proxy for temporal variation in the volume and facies diversity of fossiliferous rock (number of marine fossiliferous formations: FMF). A strong correlation between taxic diversity and FMF is present during the Cretaceous.

40|$|The {{effect of}} axial {{temperature}} gradient on the chromatographic efficiency was studied under adiabatic conditions by a modeling approach. The Equilibrium-Dispersive model of chromatography {{was used for}} the calculations. The model was extended by taking into account the axial temperature gradient. The results show that due to the temperature gradient, there are retention and migration velocity gradients in the column. Since the retention factor, k is not constant in the column, k cannot be calculated as the ratio of net retention and hold-up times. As a result of the gradual increase of migration velocity, the retention times of solutes decreases as the slope of temperature gradient increases. In addition, the band in the column have extra broadening due to larger migration velocity of the front of band. The width of bands becomes larger at larger change of temperature. In the same time, however, the release velocity of the compounds from the column is increasing as ΔT increases. Accordingly, an <b>apparent</b> <b>peak</b> compression effect makes the peaks thinner. As a result of the two counteracting effects (peak expansion, <b>apparent</b> <b>peak</b> compression) the column efficiency does not change significantly in case of axial temperature gradient under adiabatic conditions.

Contemporaneous and simultaneous EUV spectra and photometry were also obtained with the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer. Significant variability in both X-ray and EUV fluxes were observed, dominated by at least one X-ray flare and one EUV flare. We saw no evidence of primary or secondary eclipses, but exposures at these phases were short and intrinsic variability compromised detection of any geometric modulation. X-ray flux modulation was largest at high temperature, indicative of flare heating of coronal plasma rather than changes in emitting volume or global emission measure. Analysis of spectral line widths interpreted in terms of Doppler broadening suggests that both binary stellar components are active. Based on line fluxes obtained from total integrated spectra, we have modeled the emission measure and abundance distributions. The EUV spectral line fluxes were particularly useful for constraining the parameters of the “cool ” (≤ 2 × 10 6 K) plasma.

We find that the magnitude and <b>apparent</b> temperature <b>peak</b> of heat waves, such as the ones observed in Chicago in 1995 and China in 2003, have been strongly amplified by humidity. Climate model projections suggest that the percentage of area where heat wave magnitude and peak are amplified by humidity increases with increasing warming levels.

This study investigates whether observed patterns of first and last occurrences of mollusc species {{can be explained by}} poor or uneven sampling of a diverse (&# 62; 800 species) Plio-Pleistocene marine fauna from the Wanganui Basin, North Island, New Zealand. Estimates of sampling completeness are high, ranging from 78 to 98 % (mean 88 %) despite several sampling gaps in the succession. Stratigraphic permutation tests suggest that most of the <b>apparent</b> <b>peaks</b> in the local first and last appearances of species are caused by uneven sampling. However, peaks of last occurrences of species during the Late Pliocene (2. 5 – 2. 0 Ma), and of first occurrences in the Middle Pleistocene (0. 75 – 0. 5 Ma), cannot be classified as artefacts, and appear to represent real biological events. A wide Early Pleistocene gap in the stratigraphic section in the basin prevents the precise estimation of the magnitude, duration or timing of these biotic transitions. Mechanisms for the biotic change remain elusive. Better palaeoenvironmental control and detailed ecological study of selected molluscan clades are required to test alternative causal hypotheses.
