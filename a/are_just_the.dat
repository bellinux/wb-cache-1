Although the Coast Mountains are commonly considered to be the westernmost range of the American cordillera, the Insular Mountains are the true westernmost range. Through the most recent ice age about 18,000 years ago, ice enclosed nearly all of the mountains. Glaciers that ran down to the Pacific Ocean sharpened the valley faces and eroded their bottoms.|$|E

The lower chiefs have disappeared (and the word fototehina now means 'brothers'). The matāpule have also largely disappeared except those who keep the protocol and serve as official spokesmen for the king and nobles. And also the royal undertaker, Lauaki.

NBPs <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> first link in the boot chain process and they generally request via TFTP a small set of complementary files in order to get running a minimalistic OS executive (i.e. WindowsPE, or a basic Linux kernel+initrd). The small OS executive loads its own network drivers and TCP/IP stack. At this point, the remaining instructions required to boot or install a full OS are provided not over TFTP, but using a robust transfer protocol (such as HTTP, CIFS, or NFS).|$|E

500|$|The {{occurrence}} of convection {{in the outer}} envelope of a main sequence star depends on the star's mass.

Smaller stars such as the Sun <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> opposite, with the convective zone located in the outer layers. Red dwarf stars with less than 0.4 [...] are convective throughout, which prevents the accumulation of a helium core. For most stars the convective zones will also vary over time as the star ages and the constitution of the interior is modified.|$|E
500|$|The {{narrative}} team {{wanted to}} establish a new villain who was both powerful and intelligent in Halo Wars 2, which led to the introduction of the Brute warlord Atriox. Grace cited the Arbiter as a great example of a character who was unique within his species; he noted that this trait was applied to the Brutes with the creation of Atriox. To subvert the notion that Brutes <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> [...] "dumb muscle" [...] of the Covenant, Atriox is presented as a smart commander that takes advantage of the alliance's collapse. Inspiration for the character was drawn from folklore legends such as Excalibur and stories of an underling rising to power. While Atriox's faction, the Banished, have been referenced in previous Halo media, Halo Wars 2 marks their debut as the primary enemy faction. Real-world events and historical mercenary groups were a source of inspiration when designing the Banished. From the beginning, Isabel was designed to exhibit flawed behavior to distinguish her from other AI characters in the series. Ellen Ripley from the 1986 film Aliens was a particular influence for Isabel's characterization.|$|E

One of Stewie's requests was to visit the Chicago Museum of Art. As his last request he has Brian record his final thoughts.
