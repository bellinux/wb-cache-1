40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate whether}} a management decision to locate the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> in the financial statements is explained by information signaling theory. The location of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> in the financial statements is explained by information signaling theory. The location of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> is being {{the focus of this}} study because a decision on the location of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> in the financial statements is the management's discretion. The <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> is important because it tells readers of the annual report whether the firm has kept all the records properly and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the approved accounting standards. We posit that a firm that conveys good news is more likely to place its <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> {{at the beginning of the}} financial statements than at the end, and vice-versa. Based on 698 listed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia as on December 31, 2003, our evidence shows that information signaling theory does not support our prediction on the management decision to place the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report.</b> We find that about eighty percent of the firms in our study located their <b>auditor's</b> <b>reports</b> at the beginning of the financial statements. Therefore, it appears that it is the tendency of firms in Malaysia to place their <b>auditor's</b> <b>reports</b> at the beginning rather than at the end. Therefore, this signifies the importance of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> in the financial reporting framework. We reveal that none of the profitability measure, namely ROA, EPS and Tobin's q, is associated with the location of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report.</b> Therefore, information signaling theory is not supported in explaining the location of the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report...</b>|$|R

40|$|U. S. and {{international}} auditing standard setters continue {{to raise questions}} about standard auditors' reports and are exploring alternatives to those reports. Government agencies and professional organizations are also raising questions about the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report.</b> These questions point to a continued existence of an “audit expectation gap. ” To investigate perceptions and misperceptions regarding the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report,</b> we conducted focus groups with five different stakeholder groups—financial statement preparers (CFOs), users (bankers, analysts, and non-professional investors), and external auditors. This approach allows detailed comparisons between {{the perceptions of the}} different stakeholder groups affected by the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report.</b> Findings include that financial statement users value the audit, but do not read the entire <b>auditor's</b> <b>report.</b> It is not clear to users, preparers, and auditors what the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> is intended to communicate or the level of assurance being provided by the report. Stakeholders offered numerous suggestions to improve the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report,</b> but they also recognize those suggestions could significantly change the auditor's risk profile and increase audit fees. We suggest future research to determine if potential changes to the <b>auditor's</b> <b>report</b> would change users' behavior and if any resulting benefits outweigh the additional risks and costs.

5000|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} is typically primarily composed of non-executives who owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the organization, although this varies {{depending on the type}} (e.g., public versus private), size and culture of the organization. These directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically insured under directors and officers liability insurance. Fortune 500 directors are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties, and median compensation was $212,512 in 2010. The board sets corporate strategy, makes major decisions such as major acquisitions, and hires, evaluates, and fires the top-level manager (Chief Executive Officer or CEO). The CEO typically hires other positions. However, board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) has increased. In 2013, a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of CEOs were [...] "mentoring skills" [...] and [...] "board engagement", and 10% of companies never evaluated the CEO. The board may also have certain employees (e.g., internal <b>auditors)</b> <b>report</b> to them or directly hire independent contractors; for example, the board (through the audit committee) typically selects the auditor.|$|E

40|$|The <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report</b> {{is central}} to the value of the audit process. Research shows that the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report</b> per se has value to users of {{financial}} reports. It provides users with an enhanced level of reliability and confidence in their evaluation of a company’s financial statements, and this chapter presents some of the research supporting this assertion. The <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report</b> is intended to communicate to users that reasonable assurance is provided by the auditor that there are no material misstatements in the financial statements. While users have a broad understanding of this, research suggests that there is a significant gap between auditors and users’ understanding of what is provided – {{often referred to as the}} ‘expectations gap’. This lack of understanding by users often does not manifest itself in any particular issues as long as the audited entity continues to be a going concern. However, misperceptions are highlighted when there is a ‘crisis’ such as in 2008, and users start to ask why the auditor did not do more. It is in times such as these that the expectations gap becomes a prominent issue and focus is directed at what the auditor did or did not say in the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report.</b> Related to (or contributing to) this gap, research also shows that the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report</b> is generally not read beyond users evaluating whether it is modified or not – and perhaps to check whether it was audited by a Big 4 auditor or not. It should be noted that viewing the <b>auditor’s</b> <b>report</b> as a pass/fail document does provide some value to many users, but the evidence suggests that it also contributes to a significant lack of understanding of auditing. Research suggests that the standard or ‘boilerplate’ nature of <b>auditor’s</b> <b>reports</b> is also part of the problem. Related to this is the fact that <b>auditor’s</b> <b>reports</b> mainly focus on trying to explain what an audit is, whereas the research suggests that users want information about the specific audit that was conducted. Current proposals of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) suggest a few ways of making <b>auditor’s</b> <b>reports</b> more informative. Paul Cora...|$|R

Further, we find that cross-listed firms with non-Big 4 auditors are more likely to understate their earnings and experience larger reversals of accruals in the future than cross-listed firms with Big 4 auditors. These findings suggest that Big 4 auditors play a meaningful role in improving earnings quality for cross-listed firms, which helps to explain why cross-listed firms have higher earnings quality than their domestic counterparts, as documented in the previous literature...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the claims {{made in a}} recent paper in Critical Perspectives on Accounting by Vaughan Radcliffe about {{the way in which}} public sector <b>auditors</b> <b>report</b> their findings.

40|$|International audienceWe use {{a unique}} data set from {{a sample of}} 85 French firms over the period 2002 - 2008 in order to answer the {{following}} questions: Is there any relation between the use of auditors with a brand-name reputation for providing high-quality audit reports and the number of related party transactions (RPTs) reported to outside shareholders? And, how does a more transparent environment for the reporting of related party transactions affect this relationship, if at all? We find that firms audited by Big 4 <b>auditors</b> <b>report</b> fewer related party transactions. The period under study includes the change in accounting standards in Europe that occurred in 2005 with the adoption of IFRS standards, which resulted in a more transparent reporting environment for RPTs. We find that the negative relationship between auditor reputation and the number of reported of RPTs is "weaker" in a more transparent reporting environment.
