5|$|Like {{the games}} before it, Cross Days is {{presented}} with limited animation. The game is <b>audibly</b> stereophonic with lip-synched voice acting, sound effects and background music.|$|E
5|$|The finale {{completes the}} {{interconnectedness}} {{of the work}} with a theme <b>audibly</b> {{similar to those of}} the first movement and the minuet and trio. The movement is the most economical of all: the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude in exactly the same way.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 Laurence Fox apologised for {{swearing}} at {{a member}} of the audience who had been muttering <b>audibly</b> in the front row during a performance of The Patriotic Traitor at London's Park Theatre on 8 March. The audience saw Fox step out of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|Prayer {{features}} {{prominently in}} services. Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered, often with laypersons leading the prayer {{and the rest}} of the congregation <b>audibly</b> participating. During these corporate prayers, some may pray in tongues. While not in every service, the pastor will pray for the sick. This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} at the University of California, Riverside in 2008 found that hybrid cars are so quiet when operating in electric mode (EV mode) that they may pose a risk to the blind, small children, the elderly, runners, cyclists, and other pedestrians, as they may have {{only one or two}} seconds, depending on the context, to <b>audibly</b> detect the location of approaching hybrid cars when the vehicles operate at very slow speeds. This research project was funded by the National Federation of the Blind.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, {{a nearby}} Army {{reconnaissance}} team conducted a failed {{assault on the}} town {{on the basis that}} the <b>audibly</b> nearby Naval forces—which they did not know were then in retreat—would bring support. The outcome left the Union forces with a combined 5 casualties and 21 wounded. Dialogue between officers following the conflict left the Union navy questioning the usefulness of gunboats in joint expedition settings in which they would not be capable of supporting themselves.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits <b>audibly</b> speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male genitalia and an <b>audibly</b> distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly wider than the costal vein.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{the changes}} to timbre and volume was {{a shift in the}} typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same {{standard}} lest they produce <b>audibly</b> different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average concert pitch began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna. Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like Hector Berlioz, no standard could be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} anxious departure, five buses {{containing}} crowds of ravenous tourist anchovies {{stop at the}} Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by the mob, Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After the mob subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and <b>audibly</b> manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters <b>audibly</b> encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the game cartridge itself and external storage.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{reception}} for Dark Tournament has been average or mixed. While most reviewers appreciated {{the game as}} visually and <b>audibly</b> appealing to fans of the anime series, they judged it as falling short within the fighting genre due to flaws with its controls and certain gameplay mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Poorly-designed {{walkways}} increase {{risks for}} the vision-impaired, {{because it is}} more difficult than at a signalised intersection to <b>audibly</b> detect whether there is a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an audible sound can be generated to indicate {{that it is time to}} cross.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, the {{instruction}} Tres abhinc annos of 4 May 1967 gave permission {{for use of}} the vernacular even in the Canon of the Mass, and allowed it to be said <b>audibly</b> and even, in part, to be chanted; the vernacular could be used even at Mass celebrated without the people being present. Use of the maniple was made optional, and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead.|$|E
25|$|Roger Nichols {{claims to}} have used a guitar {{re-recording}} process (not reverse DI) in 1968, partly to spread the stress on cranked tube amps across multiple amps, one at a time. A sound would be dialed-in for several hours on one cranked guitar amplifier, and if this stress <b>audibly</b> wore down the amplifier components, another amplifier {{would be used to}} record the remaining work. It has been noted that Phil Spector, re-mixing the original Beatles’ Let It Be master tapes in 1970, may have re-recorded dry electric guitar program through a guitar amplifier.|$|E
25|$|Unintentional small jumps are {{ubiquitous}} to billiards. In most billiards shots, a player's cue {{is slightly}} elevated. Whenever a ball is struck with an elevated cue, a jump, {{no matter how}} slight, occurs. An oft-used way to illustrate this principle is to lay a coin on the table approximately an inch {{in front of the}} cue ball. When shot very softly, the player will <b>audibly</b> hear the coin being struck and see the cue ball's reaction to that collision. When the same shot is performed with any degree of speed no sound or collision is evident, and {{it is clear that the}} coin is being jumped.|$|E
25|$|Among Open assemblies, also termed Plymouth Brethren, the Eucharist is more {{commonly}} called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. It {{is seen as}} a symbolic memorial and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly. In principle, the service is open to all baptized Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray <b>audibly</b> and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude {{than the sum of its}} parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be <b>audibly</b> confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a theory}} that vinyl records can <b>audibly</b> {{represent}} higher frequencies than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz {{to be out of the}} range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, hearing damage from loud noise exposure typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E
25|$|In late 2012, {{the eternal}} flame began {{malfunction}}ing. The {{causes of the}} malfunction were not known, but the automatic ignition system began clicking <b>audibly.</b> On January 31, 2013, Meltech Corporation of Landover, Maryland, was awarded a $350,000 contract to upgrade the eternal flame. The work required that the permanent flame be extinguished, and a temporary flame displayed to one side. Army Corps of Engineers officials {{said that this was}} the first time a temporary flame was used since the permanent flame was installed. A solid white fence surrounded the permanent flame during the renovations, although the headstones of Kennedy and his family were not obscured. The flame was transferred to the upgraded permanent eternal flame on May 17, 2013, and the temporary flame extinguished. The refurbishment replaced the original 1967 burner with one that did not require a separate oxygen supply, laid new gas lines, relocated gas pressure regulators, installed automated controls to provide a more energy-efficient flame, and laid new electrical cables and replaced aging electrical conduits.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} of the year, but {{especially}} when the rains commence, a male will spend hours calling from a conspicuous perch. A clear, somewhat variable, whistled phrase of three to five syllables is typical, which may be rendered as tseep-tseeoo, teeoo-teewee or chiwiki-chiwi. The song may be changed after each 20 or so repetitions. During some intermissions the wings are <b>audibly</b> fluttered in the few seconds between phrases. This results in a quick prrrrt or phrrrp rattle, and may lift the bird off its perch. The crest is also lifted during display. It may alternatively sing a rudimentary song consisting of whistles, tweets and trills (distinguishable as imitated calls), during short flights over the grass or during an upward spiraling flight, before it planes down. Race malbranti in particular, may sing during a straight and direct display flight and clap its wings above its back. Perched males may also string together fragments of the songs of various grassland birds. It utters peewit, tweekiree or pree, pree notes in alarm.|$|E
25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can automatically adjust the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and <b>audibly.</b> If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E
500|$|... "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" [...] is <b>audibly</b> {{similar to}} [...] "Have a Cigar", with bluesy guitar fills and {{elaborate}} bass lines. [...] Of the song's three pigs, {{the only one}} directly identified is morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse, who amongst other things {{is described as a}} [...] "house-proud town mouse".|$|E
500|$|The {{airborne}} radio receivers—initially simple Amplitude Modulation (AM) sets—were {{tuned to}} {{the frequency of the}} LFR ground transmitters, and the Morse code audio was detected and amplified into speakers, typically in headsets worn by the pilots. The pilots would constantly listen to the audio signal, and attempt to fly the aircraft along the course lines ("flying the beam"), where a uniform tone would be heard. If the signal of a single letter (A or N) became <b>audibly</b> distinct, the aircraft would be turned as needed so that the modulation of the two letters would overlap again, and the Morse code audio would become a steady tone. The [...] "on course" [...] region, where the A and N <b>audibly</b> merged, was approximately 3° wide, which translated into a course width of ±2.6 miles when 100 miles away from the station.|$|E
500|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) {{commissioned}} {{research to}} gather statistics on accidents involving electric vehicles with pedestrians {{who are blind}} or vision impaired to determine whether the perceived accident risk is real and whether electric and hybrid [...] cars are more difficult to detect <b>audibly</b> than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The DfT goal was to use the findings to establish what sort of sound should be fitted to electric vehicles.|$|E
500|$|When Elgar {{recorded}} his major works for HMV {{in the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the LSO was chosen {{for most of the}} recordings. The LSO's pre-war recordings for Decca include Hamilton Harty's version of Walton's First Symphony, of which Gramophone magazine said, [...] "There are one or two moments where the LSO are <b>audibly</b> hanging on by the skin of their teeth, but these moments simply add to the ferocious impact of the music".|$|E
500|$|Clear-air {{lightning}} is used widely {{to describe}} lightning that occurs {{with no apparent}} cloud close enough to have produced it. In the U.S. and Canadian Rockies, a thunderstorm can be in an adjacent valley and not be observable, (either visually or <b>audibly),</b> from the valley where the lightning bolt strikes. European and Asian mountainous areas experience similar events. Also in clear areas where the storm cell is on the near horizon (within [...] a strike can occur, and as the storm is so far away, the strike {{is referred to as}} clear-air.|$|E
500|$|These magpies may {{engage in}} an {{escalating}} series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and <b>audibly</b> [...] "snap" [...] their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing {{on the ground in}} front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and pecking at the face and eyes.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in two of}} Sonic's TV adaptations (Sonic X and Sonic Boom), their {{feelings}} are explored to a much deeper extent (although this content is not considered canon). Throughout Sonic X, although Sonic usually attempts to repel her advances when {{in the company of}} friends, the two share a handful of intimate moments when alone together. In episode 52, when Sonic returns to Earth, Amy is the first person whom he chooses to visit. In the ensuing conversation, Sonic silently mouths the words [...] "I love you", causing Amy to break into tears of joy, and the two share a very heartfelt moment. This was changed in the English dub, where Amy demands that Sonic never leave her again and Sonic <b>audibly</b> replies that he never will.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{took the}} London Philharmonic on a {{controversial}} tour of Germany in 1936. [...] There were complaints {{that he was}} being used by Nazi propagandists, and Beecham complied with a Nazi request not to play the Scottish Symphony of Mendelssohn, who was a Christian by faith but a Jew by birth. In Berlin, Beecham's concert was attended by Adolf Hitler, whose lack of punctuality caused Beecham to remark very <b>audibly,</b> [...] "The old bugger's late." [...] After this tour, Beecham refused renewed invitations to give concerts in Germany, although he honoured contractual commitments to conduct at the Berlin State Opera, in 1937 and 1938, and recorded The Magic Flute for EMI in the Beethovensaal in Berlin in the same years.|$|E
500|$|Gilchrist {{has been}} noted for his {{emotional}} outbursts on the cricket field, and has been fined multiple times for dissent against umpiring decisions. In January 2006, he was fined 40% of his match fee in an ODI against South Africa. In another instance, in early 2004 in Sri Lanka, Gilchrist <b>audibly</b> argued with umpire Peter Manuel after batting partner Andrew Symonds was given out. After the argument concluded, Manuel consulted umpiring partner Billy Bowden and reversed his decision, recalling Symonds to the crease. Gilchrist was also reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board for publicly questioning the legality of Muttiah Muralitharan's bowling action in 2002, as his comments {{were found to be}} in breach of the clause in the player code of conduct relating to [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E
500|$|Public {{reaction}} to Yeezus, including its unorthodox and deliberate lack of promotion {{as well as}} its brash and aggressive sound, was mixed. Yeezus was noted {{as one of the most}} anticipated releases of 2013 by major publications, but the lack of a major radio single was regarded as a risky move. Regardless, radio stations have still played tracks from Yeezus on air, despite it being a departure from the normal playlists found on hip-hop stations. [...] "When I listen to radio, that ain't where I wanna be no more," [...] stated West at his headlining June 9, 2013 Governor's Ball performance, where he unveiled several tracks from the record for the first time. Rolling Stone summarized the audience's response: [...] "Half the crowd cheered, half almost <b>audibly</b> rolled their eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Tracy Island {{briefing}} scene, Alan Tracy's {{voice is}} <b>audibly</b> lower and deeper than in later episodes. Since voice actor Matt Zimmerman {{had yet to}} be added to the regular cast at the time of dialogue recording, Ray Barrett (who voiced John and the Hood) supplied the character's single line ("OK, father"). Despite his absence, Zimmerman is listed in the closing credits of [...] "Trapped in the Sky". A second continuity error occurs during the concluding scene. When Jeff initiates the [...] "Operation Cover-up" [...] security protocol to erase all sign of International Rescue's presence for purposes of the doctor's visit, the portraits on the wall change from photographs of the Tracy brothers in uniform to a different set in which civilian attire is worn; however, in a subsequent shot, the edge of a blue uniform is still visible.|$|E
500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} A Ghost Is Born is the fifteen-minute long track [...] "Less Than You Think". The {{first part of}} the song begins as a ballad which {{references}} belief systems and atheism which after 3 minutes, fades out. The second part begins at this moment and consists of electronic drones and noise, intended to <b>audibly</b> represent the migraines that lead singer Jeff Tweedy had been suffering from while addicted to pain killers during the recording sessions for A Ghost Is Born. For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded. The noise, which served as the coda to the song, was remixed to provide dynamics to the track. Calling it [...] "the track that everyone will hate," [...] Tweedy defended the song's inclusion on the album: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1975 Pina Bausch, who {{had taken}} over the Wuppertal ballet company, caused a stir in the ballet world with her stark depiction, played out on an earth-covered stage, in which the Chosen One is sacrificed to gratify the {{misogyny}} of the surrounding men. At the end, according to The Guardians Luke Jennings, [...] "the cast is sweat-streaked, filthy and <b>audibly</b> panting". Part of this dance appears in the movie Pina. In America, in 1980, Paul Taylor used Stravinsky's four-hand piano version of the score as the background for a scenario based on child murder and gangster film images. In February 1984 Martha Graham, in her 90th year, resumed her association with The Rite by choreographing a new production at New York's State Theater. The New York Times critic declared the performance [...] "a triumph... totally elemental, as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony, as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implication".|$|E
500|$|As a bowler, Crawford's {{technique}} was also orthodox, {{although he was}} unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second. His bowling pace varied from fast to medium, and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped <b>audibly</b> as he released it. An accurate bowler, {{it was difficult for}} batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat, but his most effective delivery was his off break: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. John Arlott described him as [...] "the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that [...] "people who have seen both men consider [...] a better all-rounder".|$|E
