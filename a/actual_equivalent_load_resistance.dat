40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{and reliability of}} ball screw feed drives is a mayor issue concerning the productivity of modern machine tools. The preloading of a ball screw thereby determines the dynamical operational behavior {{as well as the}} attainable life span. The research results presented in this paper now clearly show that the value of pretension changes depending on the velocity of the feed motion. This correlation has a major impact on the <b>actual</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> on a ball screw during operation and therefore has to be considered when estimating the operating life of a feed drive...|$|R
40|$|On-road {{charging}} {{systems for}} electric vehicles (EVs) have shown revolutionary potential in extending driving range and reducing battery capacities. The optimal <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> <b>resistances</b> to maximize receiving power of each EV according to different EV amounts are investigated. This paper introduces a typical on-road charging {{system with a}} single transmitting coil and multiple receiving coils. The equivalent circuit models according to different numbers of EVs are built. Power control strategies with regard to a varying number of EVs are then presented. Specifically, self-adaptive source voltage based on primary current detection is utilized to charge EVs, while the source can support enough EVs by providing the rated power. Otherwise, the source voltage is regulated to its maximum value and the charging energy of each EV is suggested {{to be controlled by}} adjusting the individual driving speed. A remarkable feature of the power control strategies is that the charging power for each EV is stable and can compensate for energy losses efficiently. As for urgent power demand from a particular EV with a low battery capacity, the adjustment of the corresponding <b>load</b> <b>resistance</b> is applied to alter the power distribution. The proposed technique has been verified in an experimental prototype...|$|R

40|$|Modelling of the {{electric}} power systems of a More Electric Aircraft (MEA) is multidisciplinary and quite CPU demanding. This paper suggests a modelling approach of the electromechanical actuators implemented in a portable code constituting a reasonable compromise between required CPU-time and accuracy. The approach is to divvide the actuator model in three partitions, namely an current control rectifier, electromachine and gear model. By using only quasi-stationary electrical state variables [1] the variations within {{the electric}}al power cycles are neglected. The involved electromachines are modelled {{in terms of their}} efficiencies, moment of inertia, torque and back EMF constants. The rectifiers are desccribed in terms of <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> dependent loss <b>resistances</b> corresponding to their efficiencies [2, 3]. The gears are desccribed in terms of efficiencies and gear ratios. The model is designed in the modelling language Modelica with the objective that the model, i. e. the implementation of the model, should be flexible, extensible, portable to MATLAB and object oriented. The proposed modelling approach is considered to constitute a framework in future build-up of models of entire MEA aircrafts [4]. QC 2012020...|$|R
40|$|Continuous-span, cast-in-place box girders {{have been}} popular in modern bridge construction. Secondary moments due to {{prestressing}} in continuous-span, post-tensioned girders, however, have significantly complicated the structural analysis {{and design of}} the girders. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method is a commonly used method {{in the analysis of}} continuous-span, post-tensioned concrete girders since the method reduces the analysis of a prestressed structure to that of a nonprestressed structure in which the consideration of secondary moments is not required. The basic concept of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method is that the effects of prestressing are replaced by <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> produced by the prestressed tendon along the span of the structure. The approximate <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method significantly simplifies the procedure for the computation of <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> for post-tensioned concrete girders with parabolic tendons and therefore has commonly been used by structural engineers. In this paper, three examples of simply-supported, posttensioned concrete girders with various combinations of locations of the centroid of tendons (c. g. s.) and the centroid of concrete (c. g. c.) are demonstrated to verify the accuracy of the approximate <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method. Finally, an example of the analysis of a bridge composed of a continuous-span, post-tensioned concrete box girder superstructure and a concrete pier is also demonstrated using the approximate <b>equivalent</b> <b>load</b> method. Inconstant cross sections (inconstant c. g. c, lines) near the pier of the bridge are considered in this example...|$|R

ICRF heating {{has been used in}} the Large Helical Device (LHD) and contributes to high-power steady-state experiments. Antenna <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> is important in ICRF heating; a high <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> is required for high-power injection. Many elements influence the antenna <b>loading</b> <b>resistance.</b> Here, the dependence of the <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> on various parameters is investigated. The <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> is very low at lower wave frequencies. High-power injection using such frequencies was difficult in plasma heating experiments in the LHD. The <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> increases with the plasma density. The distance between the antenna and the plasma boundary is closely related to the plasma edge density. It is important to keep the antenna away from the plasma and also keep the <b>loading</b> <b>resistance</b> at a certain level in steady-state operation for the various types of plasma. The effect of additional heating and magnetic field strength are also investigated. These results will contribute to the design of new ICRF antennas, the ICRF heating experiment in the LHD, and ICRF heating in future plasma devices...|$|R

For {{reducing}} the development time and cost, determining the load of accelerated contact fatigue testing of a multi-case and multi-stage drive train, multilevel design load method {{was used to}} calculate the pitting <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> of gears according to the load spectrum. A reasonable load of pitting fatigue testing was determined after analyzing and studying the pitting <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> of gears. Based on a reducer used for a cement mixer, the pitting <b>equivalent</b> <b>loads</b> of gears were calculated, and the load of pitting fatigue testing was determined.

40|$|The National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) and Austroads are {{developing}} a Performance Based Standards (PBS) approach to the regulation of heavy vehicles in Australia. There has been general agreement to adopt the performance measure of Gross Mass per vehicle Standard Axle Repetitions (SAR) for PBS vehicles.

The road excitation frequency, <b>load</b> <b>resistance</b> and damping ratio are found to greatly affect the energy recovery of HESA. Based on a quarter-car model, the optimal <b>load</b> <b>resistance</b> and damping ratio for maximizing the energy-recyclable power are discussed. The results indicate that for any excitation frequency, the energy-recyclable power first increases then decreases with the <b>load</b> <b>resistance</b> increase, and the optimal <b>load</b> <b>resistance</b> is changeable as the excitation frequency changes. Moreover, the energy-recyclable power is more sensitive to excitation frequency than to damping ratio, and the ideal excitation frequency for energy recovery is around the wheel resonant frequency.
