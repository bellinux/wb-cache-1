500|$|In November 2005, Marvel Studios {{worked to}} start {{development}} from scratch, and announced Iron Man as their first independent feature, as the character was their only major one not already depicted in live action. According to associate producer Jeremy Latcham, [...] "we went after about 30 writers {{and they all}} passed", saying they were uninterested in the project due to both the relative obscurity of the character and it being a solely Marvel production. Even the rewrites when the film had a script led to many refusals. In order to build awareness for Iron Man from the general public, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> {{the same level of}} popularity as Spider-Man or Hulk, Marvel conducted focus groups to help remove the general perception that the character was a robot. After the groups proved successful, the information Marvel received helped them formulate an awareness-building plan, which included releasing three animated short films ahead of the film's release. The shorts were called [...] "Iron Man Advertorials", and were produced by Tim Miller and Blur Studio.|$|E

The recruits feared that their weekend leave would be cancelled if they succeeded in confiscating their sergeant's rifle, but the sergeant assured them {{that this was not}} the case. Miller volunteered to combat the instructor, and succeeded by tripping him and removing his firearm. The sergeant angrily protested that Miller had tripped him and told Miller to repeat his feat. Miller again tripped the sergeant and disarmed him, this time contemptuously wiping his boot on his NCO's shirt and soiling it. The irate instructor cancelled Miller's leave <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> guard duty, further threatening the other recruits with the same fate for protesting Miller's treatment. However, the recruits protested the ruling with the camp adjutant, who overruled the sergeant, putting him on guard duty instead of Miller.|$|E

2500|$|... "Indian John" [...] {{tried to}} get the Tomahittan to kill Arthur but the chief {{prevented}} this by adopting Gabriel. For about a year, Arthur, dressed as the Tomahittan of Chota, traveled with the chief and his war parties on revenge raids of Spanish settlements in Florida (after ten were killed, and ten captured during a peaceful trading mission several years back), Indian communities on the east coast, and Shawnee towns on the Ohio River in the winter of 1673/1674. When the Tomahittan tribe attacked the Shawnees in the Ohio River valley, Arthur was wounded by an arrow and captured, but he was saved from burning at the stake by a Shawnee who was sympathetic to him. Upon learning that Arthur had married a Tomahittan maiden ("Hannah Rebecca" [...] Nikitie), the Shawnee cured his wound, gave him his gun, gave him rokahamoney to eat, <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a road that led back to his family at Chota. Most agree this road was the Warrior's Path that crossed the Ohio {{at the mouth of the}} Scioto, went south across the Red River branch of the Kentucky River, then up Station Camp Creek and through Ouasiota Pass into the Ouasiota Mountains. In June 1674 (1678?), the chief escorted Arthur back to his English settlement in Virginia. Arthur's accounts of both the land and the tribes who inhabited it supplied the first detailed information about Kentucky. Arthur was also among the first Europeans (preceded by Batts and Fallam) to visit modern West Virginia, and cross the Cumberland Gap.|$|E
