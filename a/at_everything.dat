Lynch spent {{the next few months}} in non-title matches against Charlotte, losing three in a row. On the 23 October episode of NXT, after being told to make herself relevant, Lynch aligned herself with Sasha Banks by attacking Bayley, turning into a villainess in the process. Known as Team B.A.E. (Best <b>at</b> <b>Everything),</b> the alliance started to disintegrate when Banks cost Lynch a match against Bayley in February 2015.|$|E

25|$|The Lost Souls skill {{system is}} based on a value {{assigned}} to each of the character's attributes, such as strength, dexterity, and charisma. The higher their attribute in a given area, more specialization points are available to allocate for a certain skill. For example, higher dexterity allows the user to allocate more specialty points to the use of swords. The more specialty points that are allocated for a certain skill, the faster the skill can be learned and improved. It also increases the maximum skill level the player can have for that particular skill. The intention of this is to allow for 'heroic' levels of capability to be achievable without the risk of a situation arising where everyone becomes equally, superhumanly capable <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> since the system limits and promotes development of different skills at different times.|$|E

Before the interview begins, Gale explores the folly, going through one doorway and {{emerging from the}} other, back where she started, thanks to an optical illusion that fools one into thinking one is ascending to a higher level. Jason sits in, attempting to control the interview, both he and Gale with tape recorders; but Gale steers the conversation around to how Charlie became famous. In reality, he first grabbed attention as an inept, injured sportsman being carried away from a Marathon, applauded by the crowd. Appearing on a game show he gained public sympathy by getting all the questions wrong. But invited back he eventually became celebrity host of the show. Charlie is happy to be considered useless <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> but Gale suggests he is failing on purpose.|$|E
25|$|Sylvester Joseph led the West Indian side in Shivnarine Chanderpaul's absence {{owing to}} illness. Openers Xavier Marshall and Runako Morton {{attacked}} from the outset, plundering 37 {{runs from the}} first six overs, when Irfan Pathan got Marshall out with an inswinger and bowled a wicket-maiden over. Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Anil Kumble continued to dig out wickets, but Morton remained at the crease. The West Indies crashing to 112/6 after 24 overs. Kumble did get Banks and Dwayne Smith out lbw, the latter for a 12-ball cameo that yielded 26 runs. However, Morton stuck in, making 84, before losing his wicket to Nehra, getting caught by Dravid. West Indies needed 68 runs from 11 overs, with three wickets in hand. Denesh Ramdin, the wicket-keeper, gave it a go. He hacked <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> missing occasionally, but also getting quite a few boundaries. His team needed twelve runs off the last over, and Nehra conceded only 4, helping his team win by seven runs.|$|E
25|$|India won the toss, and Ganguly, {{elected to}} field, hoping to take {{advantage}} of a pitch left damp by dew and rain. On a lively Wanderers Stadium pitch, the Australian openers took advantage of very wayward Indian opening bowlers to get off to a flying start. Adam Gilchrist (57 from 48 balls, 8 fours, 1 six) and Matthew Hayden (37 from 54 balls, 5 fours) shared an opening partnership of 105 runs in 14 overs, forcing Ganguly to bring on the spinners unusually early. The change of pace brought wickets with Adam Gilchrist, who had been swinging <b>at</b> <b>everything,</b> holing out off a sweep shot from the bowling of Harbhajan Singh. Matthew Hayden, looking somewhat better than he had throughout the tournament, soon followed for 37, leaving Australia at 2/125 Captain Ricky Ponting (140 from 121 balls, 4 fours, 8 sixes) and Damien Martyn (88 from 84 balls, 7 fours, 1 six) (playing with a broken thumb) completing a partnership of 234 runs in 30.1 overs, an Australian record for one-day cricket. Ponting and Martyn started efficiently, putting away bad balls but mostly keeping the scoring going with good running, then letting loose in the last ten overs, taking 109 from them. Ponting in particular dispatched the bowling over the fence with fearsome regularity in scoring 8 sixes, the most from one batsman in any World Cup match at the time. The final Australian total of 359 (2 wickets, 50 overs), at a run rate of 7.18 runs an over, was their then second highest ever in ODI history.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done.

Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E
