Jake and Jamin were 16 and 14, respectively, when they created the label. The label’s first release was a live album called Tusky Mahloo by the brothers’ band The Sex, which later turned into JEFF the Brotherhood. Since its inception, the label has released almost 100 albums from bands like JEFF the Brotherhood, Diarrhea Planet, Natural Child, PUJOL, and {{be your own}} PET.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{historically}} the intra-aortic balloon pump {{has been}} the only mechanical circulatory support device available to clinicians, a number of new devices have become commercially available and have entered clinical practice. These include axial flow pumps, such as Impella®; left atrial to femoral <b>artery</b> bypass <b>pumps,</b> specifically the TandemHeart; and new devices for institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These devices differ significantly in their hemodynamic effects, insertion, monitoring, and clinical applicability. This document reviews the physiologic impact on the circulation of these devices and their use in specific clinical situations. These situations include patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, those presenting with cardiogenic shock, and acute decompensated heart failure. Specialized uses for right-sided support and in pediatric populations are discussed and the clinical utility of mechanical circulatory support devices is reviewed, as are the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines...|$|R

This study investigates technical difficul-ties with regard to variant hepatic arteries and the preliminary outcomes for patients treated with LHAIP placement. Methods: Between March 1998 and January 2003, 38 patients with colorectal metastases confined to the liver, 35 (92 %) of who had prior systemic chemotherapy that failed, were treated with LHAIP. Results: Twelve patients (32 %) had LHAIP placement only, and 26 (68 %) had pump placement combined with laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation (LRFA; 24 patients) and/or liver resection (2 patients). Variant hepatic arterial (HA) anatomy was present in 18 patients (47 %). The presence of a variant HA did not increase pump complications, operative time, or blood loss (P. 20) or decrease the functional time of pump use (P. 91) in comparison with normal anatomy. In all patients with a variant HA, laparoscopic ligation of the variant vessel and/or cannulation of nongastroduodenal artery resulted in complete hepatic perfusion.

An open chest bovine right heart bypass model (n = 9, bodyweight 72 +/- 6 kg) with passive blood drainage from the right atrium into the venous reservoir and active retransfusion into the pulmonary <b>artery</b> (roller <b>pump)</b> was selected for this purpose. Clear priming {{was used for the}} open perfusion circuit. No heparin was given before or during the evaluation period which was scheduled for 6 hours. Reservoir blood flow was at the beginning 3. 5 +/- 0. 6 l/min for coated versus 3. 4 +/- 0. 3 l/min for uncoated (NS). After 6 hours, blood flow was 3. 3 +/- 0. 1 l/min for coated versus 2. 7 +/- 0. 4 l/min for uncoated (p < 0. 05). Hematocrit moved from a baseline level of 30 +/- 2 % for coated versus 28 +/- 3 % for uncoated (NS) to 28 +/- 3 % for coated versus 27 +/- 5 % for uncoated (NS) after 6 hours. Prebypass platelet levels of 100 % in both groups moved to 84 +/- 3 % for coated versus 78 +/- 23 % for uncoated (NS) after 6 hours.

40|$|During the {{development}} of a new circulatory support system, we have used different animal models with and without heart failure for hemodynamic testing. As the normally functioning heart does not always allow for proper evaluation of a circulatory support system, a good and adjustable animal heart failure model is needed. The aim of the study was to develop a left ventricular failure model in calves for acute hemodynamic studies. The principle is based on the negative inotropic effect of drugs with bypass of the right ventricle. Seven calves were used in the study. Metoprolol and verapamil were both given intravenously as a bolus, and verapamil was continued as an infusion. The animals were equipped with a VVI pacemaker to treat the expected arteriovenous blockade. A centrifugal pump provided an adjustable flow with a two-stage inflow cannula draining both the upper and lower caval veins and with the outflow cannula in the pulmonary <b>artery.</b> The <b>pump</b> counteracted the effects of right ventricular failure and enabled us to increase the left atrial pressure to more than 20 mm Hg. Pressure in the left atrium rose from 5 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 4 mm Hg (p < 0. 001), the left ventricular diastolic pressure increased from 2 3 to 17 7 mm Hg (p = 0. 003), and the mean pulmonary pressure increased from 17 5 to 33 5 mm Hg (p < 0. 001). Cardiac output was not significantly changed from 4. 0 &PLUSMN; 0. 8 L/min in the healthy animals to 3. 5 &PLUSMN; 0. 5 L/min (p = 0. 25) in failure.

40|$|When cardioplegic {{solution}} is injected into coronary <b>arteries</b> with a <b>pump</b> {{in order to}} ensure myocardial protection, it is necessary to determine the correct delivery pressure to avoid damage of the heart. Biomechanical and structural properties of the neonatal coronary artery wall should be taken into account when determining the delivery pressure. We investigated twelve coronary artery specimens without cardiac pathology retrieved from autopsies of neonates 9. 3 ± 9. 7 days old and compared them to adult specimens with no detected atherosclerosis. There was a rapid increase in the strain until the inner pressure reached 80 - 100 mmHg, whilst the increase of stress in the wall of the neonatal coronary arteries was less rapid. When the pressure exceeded 100 mmHg, the increase in the strain slowed down, whilst the wall stress and modulus of elasticity began to increase rapidly. Morphologic examination of tensile properties revealed prominent affection of the vascular wall of the neonates, with accentuated redistribution (loosening) of medial myocytes and the adventitial vasa vasorum. Collectively, a raised inner pressure applied to cardioplegic solution injected into the coronary artery of a neonate may increase the risk of structural damage to the vascular wall...|$|R

Unwanted side effects of CPB are well known but poorly understood. We therefore developed a rodent model to study the pathophysiology of these potential complications. Male Fischer rats were anaesthetized, intubated and ventilated. The carotid artery and jugular vein were cannulated. The blood was actively drained from the venous circulation and further transferred by a miniaturized roller pump to a hollow fibre oxygenator and back to the animal via the carotid <b>artery.</b> The roller <b>pump</b> produces a pulsatile blood flow between 5 and 40 ml/min. The surface of the hollow fibre oxygenator is 0. 025 m 2. The priming volume (Ringer solution) of the whole system is 12 ml. Animals were catheterized and brought in partial bypass for a mean of 50 ^ 15 min. Normal cardiac function after successful weaning was confirmed by electrocardiography and blood pressure measurements. This technical study demonstrates the feasibility of a small animal model of CPB. The main improvement over existing techniques is the use of a highly effective hollow fibre oxygenator with a minimized priming volume.

The frequency of usual high risk factors was: renal failure and coagulation disorders in 15 % of patients, onset of the haemorrhage in this hospital in 28 % and respiratory distress in 24 %. BICAP therapy alone allows permanent hemostasis in 94 % of acute GD ulcers (n = 32) and in 77 % of chronic GD ulcers (n = 82).

5000|$|The twin {{reversed}} arterial perfusion, or TRAP sequence, {{results in}} an acardiac twin, a parasitic twin that fails to develop a head, arms and a heart. The parasitic twin, {{little more than a}} torso with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host twin by means of an umbilical cord-like structure, much like a fetus in fetu, except the acardiac twin is outside the host twin's body. The blood received by the parastitic twin has already been used by normal fetus, and as such is already de-oxygenated, leaving little developmental nutrients for the acardiac twin. Because it is pumping blood for both itself and its acardiac twin, this causes extreme stress on the normal fetus's heart. Many TRAP pregnancies result in heart failure for the healthy twin. This twinning condition usually occurs very early in pregnancy. A rare variant of the acardiac fetus is the acardius acormus where the head is well-developed but the heart {{and the rest of the}} body are rudimentary. While it is thought that the classical TRAP/Acardius sequence is due to a retrograde flow from the umbilical <b>arteries</b> of the <b>pump</b> twin to the iliac arteries of the acardiac twin resulting in preferential caudal perfusion, acardius acormus is thought to be a result of an early embryopathy.|$|R

The {{aim of this}} experimental {{study was to determine}} the feasibility and to improve the haemodynamics of a venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiectomy. METHODS A venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass was established in seven calves (56. 4 ± 7 kg) by the transjugular insertion to the caval axis of a self-expanding cannula, with a carotid artery return. After baseline measurements (A), ventricular fibrillation was induced (B), great arteries were clamped (C), the heart was excised and the right and left atria remnants, containing the pulmonary veins, were sutured together leaving an atrial septal defect over the cannula in the caval axis (D). Measurements were taken with the pulmonary artery clamped and declamped. RESULTS Initial pump flow was 4. 16 ± 0. 75 l/min dropping to 2. 9 ± 0. 63 l/min (P(AB) < 0. 001) 10 min after induction of ventricular fibrillation. After cardiectomy with the pulmonary <b>artery</b> clamped, the <b>pump</b> flow increased non-significantly to 3. 20 ± 0. 78 l/min. After declamping, the flow significantly increased close to baseline levels (3. 61 ± 0. 73 l/min, P(DB) = 0. 009, P(DC) = 0. 017), supporting the notion that full cardiopulmonary bypass in acardia is feasible only if adequate drainage of pulmonary circulation is assured to avoid pulmonary congestion and loss of volume from the left-to-right shunt of bronchial vessels...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxemia {{has long}} been known to produce a {{decrease}} in resistance in the vascular system of the heart. From studies on the effect of hypox-emia on coronary blood flow in the dog heart-lung preparation, Hilton and Eichholtz (2) reached the conclusion that the decrease in coronary re-sistance produced by hypoxemia is due to a direct action of low arterial oxygen tension on the smooth muscle of the vessels. However, the evi-dence in support of this contention is indirect and does not exclude myocardial hypoxia as the ini-tiating factor. If it can be demonstrated that under certain ex-perimental conditions, which exclude myocardial hypoxia, a reduction in coronary arterial oxygen content does not increase coronary blood flow, then it would appear doubtful that low arterial oxygen tension has a direct action on the smooth muscle of the coronary vessels. This report is concerned with experiments in which high coro-nary perfusion pressures were employed in an at-tempt to determine the effect of low arterial oxy-gen tension on the coronary vessels in the absence of myocardial hypoxia. METHODS I. Experiments on the intact beating heart Eleven technically satisfactory experiments were per-formed on open-chest dogs anesthetized with pentobarbi-tal (30 mgm. per Kg.). Preparation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{modified}} Blalock-Taussig (mBT) shunt is an anastomosis created {{between the}} systemic and pulmonary arterial tree {{in order to}} improve pulmonary blood flow in neonates and children with congenital heart disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess vascular resistance-flow relationship in an in vitro set-up of a modified Blalock Taussig shunt. METHODS: A shunt set-up was constructed with the vessels of a sheep. A modified BT shunt was anastomosed between an innominate (brachiocephalic) and a right pulmonary <b>artery.</b> A Medos <b>pump</b> (ventricular assist device) was used to create pulsatile flow. Three different mean pulmonary artery flow rates (Q PA) were applied. Once mean pulmonary and mean aortic flows (Q AO) were fixed, shunt flow rates for twelve different pulmonary vascular resistances (R p) were investigated. RESULTS: For all three pulmonary flow rates, the shunt flow decreased with increasing pulmonary resistance. In addition, systemic flow decreased compared to pulmonary flow. When pulmonary flow rate was set at 800 ml/min and aorta flow rate at 900 ml/min, the distribution of flow between pulmonary and systemic organs flow rates ranged between 69 % - 70 % and 30 % - 31 % respectively. Similarly, when both pulmonary and aorta flow rates were set at 900 ml/min, pulmonary and systemic organ flows ranged between 73 % - 77 % and 23 % - 27 % respectively. For pulmonary and aorta flow rates of 1000 ml/min and 900 ml/min, respectively, the distribution of flow between pulmonary and systemic organ flow rates varied between 79 % - 83 % and 17 % - 21 % respectively. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the relationship between vascular resistances and flow in this surgically created in vitro mBT shunt set-up may be helpful in the clinical management of the patients whose survival is crucially dependent on the blood flow distribution between the pulmonary and systemic circulation. status: publishe...|$|R
