500|$|Francis {{characterized}} Genevieve as [...] "harsh", attesting {{this quality}} to her past tragedy. In {{an interview with}} AOL, Francis said that, [...] "Although tragic things have happened to her, she is not tragic." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps described Genevieve as an [...] "eerie bitch". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described her as [...] "kooky" [...] and [...] "The Pervy-Odd Mob Mama". The soap opera's official website describes her relationship with Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers) as [...] "twisted" [...] and [...] "confusing". Genevieve was considerably [...] "darker" [...] than the role of Laura Spencer on General Hospital, which Francis loved. She said, [...] "It's so freeing to let your dark side shine for a minute <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> a scene when you've been really evil, when the scene ends, you laugh. It's just fun." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is just too much fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
2500|$|... “I {{hate that}} I got into Kurt {{there at the}} end racing to the line,’’ Logano said. “I had a run to turn up {{underneath}} him <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that, the cars get free and then I was there and he tried to catch it and I was there again. It is a product of this racing, but I hate that it happened. The last thing I want to do is hit someone like that. Unfortunately, it happened.’’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Only,' growled Sophy, in her hoarse boy's voice, 'Lucy said mamma {{said she}} would not call on Mrs. Osborn unless <b>you</b> ordered her, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> she cried <b>and</b> flew into a {{tremendous}} passion.' ...|$|R

2500|$|After the game, many sports writers {{commented on}} Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't {{impressed}} by it. [...] "How {{can you be}} in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?" [...] Warner pointed out. [...] "People think this season {{is the first time}} I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years – just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> achieve something, you know luck {{has nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{split with}} Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham {{spent much of}} the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo album, Out of the Cradle, which was {{released}} in 1992. [...] Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band. [...] "There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left. If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things. While we made Rumours (in 1977) there were two couples breaking up in the band (Buckingham and Nicks, and John and Christine McVie), and we had to say, [...] "This is an important thing we're doing, so we've got to put this set of feelings {{on this side of the}} room and get on with it.'" [...] <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that long enough you forget that those feelings are even there. On this album, I'm putting all these feelings in the healthiest possible perspective and that, looking at it broadly, is a lot of what the album is dealing with. It's a catharsis, absolutely." [...] "Wrong" [...] was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwood's tell-all biography. Out of the Cradle received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac. However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992–93 for the first time as a solo artist; his band included an army of seven other guitarists (Buckingham himself calls them [...] "the crazy band" [...] on his Soundstage DVD), each of whom he individually taught the entire two-and-a-half hours of music from the concert (Lindsey Buckingham: Behind the Music documentary for VH-1, 2001).|$|E

6000|$|... "How late you are, girl!" [...] {{the cook}} said angrily. [...] "You {{told me you}} would come again today, and I relied upon <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come it was too late, for the market was closed." ...|$|R

6000|$|Too {{prudent to}} excite the natives' {{attention}} unnecessarily, the cautious Frenchman whispered, {{in the most}} commonplace voice on earth to Felix: [...] "Don't look at once; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> look, mind you don't exhibit any agitation in your tone or manner.

I felt sure that had you known nothing you would have often talked to us of meeting them in London, and of the happiness it would be. I would not ask, because I was sure you had a good reason for not telling us; but I was quite sure that there was something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I loved you," [...] {{she whispered}} back. [...] "Oh, Rob, {{you are all}} the world to me. I belong to you and the sea. But I never knew it until I crossed the harbour tonight. Then I knew--it came to me all at once, like a flood of understanding. I knew I could never go away again--that I must stay here forever where I could hear that call of wind and waves. The new life was good--good--but it could not go deep enough. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come I knew what was in my heart for you as well." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is a bit}} {{difficult}} for you, I daresay," [...] he remarked.

5000|$|Regarding the track, [...] "For One Night Only", Anderson stated: [...] "It was {{originally}} called [...] "Fighting and Shagging". I {{found that one}} really hard to write.
