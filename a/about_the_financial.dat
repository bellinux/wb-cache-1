5|$|In {{the late}} 1860s and 1870s, Wallace was very {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> security of his family. While {{he was in the}} Malay Archipelago, the sale of specimens had brought in a considerable amount of money, which had been carefully invested by the agent who sold the specimens for Wallace. However, on his return to the UK, Wallace made a series of bad investments in railways and mines that squandered most of the money, and he found himself badly in need of the proceeds from the publication of The Malay Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 Trump {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor {{to talk to his}} wife, Jean Chatzky, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E

25|$|More {{economic}} changes {{emerged in the}} late 2000s when Chinese investors began moving to Saskatchewan and brokering land deals. MaxCrop (a Regina-based agriculture company) is {{a major player in}} these agreements; the organization finds farmland investors among Chinese and South Korean investors and partners them with local farmers who grow crops which are then sold to customers in China. While MaxCrop’s involvement has increased farming activity throughout the province, concerns are emerging <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> barrier of entry for new farmers. Furthermore, some local farmers have expressed concern that Chinese and South Korean investors may be purchasing land that is not ideal for farming.|$|E

Strabo (c. 1st century BCE) mentions the embassies sent by the Pandyas to the court of Augustus, along with a description of the ambassadors. Pliny (c. 77 CE) talks about the different items imported by the Romans from India and complains <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> drain caused by them. He also refers to many Tamil ports in his work The Natural History. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60 - 100 CE) an anonymous work, gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom'.|$|E

25|$|Talk of {{the death}} of the club due to {{financial}} troubles occurred as early as 1986. In 1989 the directors agreed to amalgamation with equally troubled Footscray to form the Fitzroy Bulldogs, but a fightback from Footscray supporters, in which almost two million dollars was raised in three weeks, averted the merger. At other times, joining with Melbourne or relocating to Brisbane was suggested. As well as trying several fund-raising ventures, the Lions experimented with playing four home matches in Tasmania in 1991 and 1992, but lost money in the process. In 1994, the club moved its home matches to Western Oval, its fourth match-day home ground in 10 years. Amid uncertainties <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> future of the club, its on-field performances continued to deteriorate, {{to the point where the}} Lions finished last by a long way in 1995 and 1996, winning just three matches in those seasons combined.|$|E

500|$|John O'Reily (born John O'Reilly, 19 November 1846 – 6 July 1915) was an Australian Roman Catholic clergyman, {{the first}} Bishop of Port Augusta, {{and the second}} Archbishop of Adelaide. [...] Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, O'Reily studied for the priesthood in Dublin. [...] Upon his {{ordination}} in 1869, he migrated to Western Australia, serving as a parish priest in Fremantle, and founding a Catholic newspaper there. [...] When the Diocese of Port Augusta was established in 1887, Pope Leo XIII named O'Reily as its first bishop. [...] Concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> position of the diocese (which had inherited significant debt from the Diocese of Adelaide), he accepted the posting reluctantly. [...] As bishop, he greatly improved the financial position of the new diocese, reducing its debt by half and earning {{a reputation as a}} competent administrator.|$|E
500|$|Demolition of {{the plant}} raised concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> effects on the local North Shore School District, as the over $20 million annual tax {{payments}} from the plant provided 20 percent of the district's budget. [...] This led to fears of a 15–19% increase in residential taxes in late 2014. However, {{it was determined that}} according to state law there could be no more than a 1% increase in property taxes for a given tax class {{as a result of a}} decreased tax assessment in another class (the four tax classes being residential, cooperatives/condominiums, commercial, and utilities). The financial effects on the district would thus have to be mitigated by increased taxes on remaining utilities in the district, as well as a $2.5 million one-time grant from the state arranged by local state legislators. [...] The site's municipal and school payments in lieu of taxes fell from $23.2 million in 2012 to $16.6 million in 2015.|$|E
500|$|Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project {{appeared}} {{inevitable in}} October 1990, {{as a new}} area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered {{in the path of}} the turnpike. OTA officials did not bring the area to USACE's attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland. Frustration mounted after the find; rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area. In an interview after an OTA meeting, chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying [...] "God only knows when [...] be completed," [...] describing the project as a [...] "total disaster" [...] and commenting [...] "If we had it all to do over again, we wouldn't do that project." [...] OTA was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> impact of USACE's delay in issuing the required permits; each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added $20,000 (approximately $ in [...] dollars) to the total cost of the project. USACE finally issued the permit on November 15, over a year after OTA applied for it.|$|E
