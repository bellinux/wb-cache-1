25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E

Swedien said of Jackson recording the song, that, [...] "I tried {{all sorts of things}} with Michael – for instance, he would sing the main vocal part and we'd double it one time and then I'd ask him to step away from the mic and do it a third time <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> changed the acoustics in the room so it gave Michael's vocals a unique character … We recorded some of those background vocals in the shower stall at Westlake." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{incarnation of}} [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{developed during the}} recording sessions for Achtung Baby. While working in Hansa Ton Studios in Berlin, guitarist The Edge and lead singer Bono created the verse. The track was given the working title [...] "Sinatra" [...] {{in reference to the}} artist whose music inspired it. The group reworked it in preparation of Zooropa. The Edge noted [...] "it came to us in installments". Bassist Adam Clayton said [...] "it was hard to figure out how we would do it. I mean, {{no one is going to}} mistake us for Frank Sinatra's backing band. A very humble little combo sound is what we ended up with <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> worked." [...] The Edge added [...] "I was playing around on piano with some old-school chord progressions trying to summon up the spirit of Frank Sinatra. It's definitely not from a rock and roll tradition." [...] He worked out a chord progression based on old Tin Pan Alley songs.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor [...] "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the band's musical direction, Sugar stated [...] "I think {{we got a little}} more {{progressive}} since the debut, more complex.

500|$|The Mavericks {{advanced}} to the Western Conference Finals, where they again met the Suns. Nowitzki scored 50 points to lead the Mavericks to {{a victory in the}} crucial Game 5 with the series tied at 2; the Mavericks won the series in six games and faced the Miami Heat in the 2006 NBA Finals. A content Nowitzki commented: [...] "We've been a good road team all season long, we believed in each other. We went through some ups and downs this season, but the playoffs are all about showing heart and playing together." [...] Of Nowitzki's performance, ESPN columnist Bill Simmons wrote, [...] "Dirk is playing at a higher level than any forward since [...] Bird." [...] The Mavericks took an early 2–0 lead, but then gave away a late 15-point lead in a Game 3 loss and finally fell to a scoring onslaught by Heat Finals MVP Dwyane Wade: Wade scored at least 36 points in the next four games, all of which the Heat won. Nowitzki only made 20 of his last 55 shots in the final three games as the Mavericks lost the Finals series, 4–2, to the Heat. The German was criticized by ESPN as [...] "clearly ... not as his best this series" [...] and remarked: [...] "That was a tough loss (in Game 3) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> changed the whole momentum of the series. ... After that, they got confidence. They played a lot better afterwards." ...|$|E
2500|$|West Indies manager Clive Lloyd {{thought it}} was a mistake to go ahead with 1998–99 South Africa tour after the players' protest over pay and conditions, made in London between planes to South Africa.

2500|$|On {{the opening}} drive {{of the second}} half, the Bills moved the ball 80 yards and scored with Reich's 17-yard {{touchdown}} pass to James Lofton, increasing their lead to 14-3. On the play before the touchdown, Reich had thrown the ball right {{into the hands of}} defensive back Richard Shelton while trying to connect with Beebe, but Shelton dropped the pass, costing his team what would have been an easy touchdown return.

2500|$|Marcus Mumford, {{front man}} of Mumford & Sons, recognizes the group's influence: [...] "I first heard Old Crow's music when I was, like, 16, 17, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> got me into, like, folk music, bluegrass. I mean, I'd {{listened to a}} lot of Dylan, but I hadn't really ventured into the country world so much. So Old Crow were the band that made me fall in love with country music." [...] Mumford {{acknowledges}} in [...] "Big Easy Express", Emmett Malloy's [...] "moving documentary" [...] about the vintage train tour they'd invited Old Crow to join them on, that [...] "the band inspired them to pick up the banjo and start their now famous country nights in London." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{decided to}} change the name from Saints & Sinners to The Oracle and the reason being because I started {{doing a lot of}} {{research}} on Saints & Sinners, and although I liked what it represented, it's been done before. I think Whitesnake had a record in 1982 or some like that, before which I wasn't that worried about because that's almost 30 years ago, but there has been some other artists, even Spanish albums that I found called Saints & Sinners in Spanish. With all that put together, I started rethinking the name, and then with the name Godsmack, and then the title being called Saints & Sinners, it was all feeling a little bit religious to me, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> wasn't what this record represented..." ...|$|E

Her next start was the Apollo Stakes at Randwick, originally scheduled for 11 February but delayed to 13 February due to extreme heat in the Sydney area. Winx broke poorly, then settled in mid pack behind a fast early pace. She swung out three-wide leaving the far turn, then pulled away in the stretch to defeat Hartnell by two lengths.

2500|$|The {{music video}} was heavily {{criticized for being}} overly violent and graphic. Madonna's {{spokesperson}} {{said that there was}} a lot of violence because it tells the story of a woman who had probably been abused. Madonna also explained that her character was acting out a [...] "fantasy and doing things that girls are not allowed to do." [...] The video was received only early hours play on MTV. However, it was not the first time that Madonna had a video rejected for heavy rotation by MTV, since in 1990, the channel refused to show [...] "Justify My Love" [...] because of its steamy images, and in 1992 MTV only showed [...] "Erotica" [...] late at night. The decision to ban the video was a source of argument, since it appeared to be no more violent than some television shows that aired at the time. Ironically, the video went into heavy rotation on Oh! Oxygen and was streamed on America Online frequently. It was also later played frequently on VH1 Madonna programs, but in an edited format. According to Eden Miller of PopMatters, the reason why the video was possibly banned from MTV was due to the scene where it featured Madonna pointing a gun towards the police, as MTV had previously banned videos that contained guns. Miller explained that [...] "while Madonna is one of MTV's darlings, she's still a woman, and the idea of a woman taking her aggressions out on men is something the network can just not have. That's what is so disturbing [...] <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> is what it feels like for a girl." [...] MSN listed the song on [...] "Madonna's Most Shocking Moments" [...] and said the song was supporting a [...] "pro-feminist image".|$|E
2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>really</b> used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
