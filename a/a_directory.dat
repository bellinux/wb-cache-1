5|$|Hale {{had spent}} many {{hundreds}} of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale–Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10.5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius. Hale first established {{that there was no}} other deep-sky object near M70, and then consulted <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky. Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars, he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, the clearing house for astronomical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, a steam packet service {{started to}} run between Driffield and Hull. Three return trips each week were made, but the journey times were too long, and an {{advertisement}} in 1825 indicated that the engine had been altered and an express steam packet service would commence. Three boats were recorded as trading between Driffield and Hull every other day in <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> of Yorkshire published in 1823. Traffic for 1832 included 7,394 chaldrons of coal, 18,173 quarters of wheat, 7,745 quarters of oats, 19,396 quarters of barley and 4,555 sacks of flour. An additional 1,564 quarters of wheat and 8,194 sacks of flour were carried to or from Foston Mill, reached from Frodingham Beck. A regular carrier also operated between the Leven Canal and Hull once a week.|$|E

25|$|Within <b>a</b> single <b>directory,</b> {{filename}}s must be unique.

25|$|Selecting <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> in the Navigation pane on {{the left}} designates it as the current directory, {{displaying}} its contents in the Contents pane on the right. However, expanding (+) or collapsing (-) {{a portion of the}} tree without selecting <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> will not alter the contents of the right pane. The exception to this behavior applies when collapsing a parent of the current directory, in which case the selection is refocused on the collapsed parent directory, thus altering the list in the Contents pane.|$|E
25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by {{external}} users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the warez content. Messages could be left for other warez users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.|$|E

500|$|Though {{interesting}} {{on their}} own, the design concepts of Plan 9 {{were supposed to}} be most useful when combined together.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>directory</b> {{table is}} a special type of file that {{represents}} <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> (also known as a folder). Since 86-DOS 0.42, each file or (since MS-DOS 1.40 and PCDOS 2.0) subdirectory stored within it is represented by a 32-byte entry in the table. Each entry records the name, extension, attributes (archive, directory, hidden, read-only, system and volume), {{the address of the}} first cluster of the file/directory's data, the size of the file/directory, and the date and (since PCDOS 1.1) also the time of last modification. Earlier versions of 86-DOS used 16-byte directory entries only, supporting no files larger than 16 MB and no time of last modification.|$|E
