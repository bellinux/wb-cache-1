40|$|This article {{proposes a}} model for {{understanding}} the factors contributing to long-standing depression in {{women who have been}} raped. A path analysis of data obtained from 71 women who had been raped revealed that women with general-ized beliefs that they could not control events in their lives were more likely to attribute responsibility for their rape to permanent intrapsychic factors and {{were more likely to be}} depressed. Women who perceived that they had higher levels of internal control tended to have higher levels of education, were more likely to be employed, and were less likely to be depressed more than one year <b>after</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped.</b> Childhood sexual abuse was not associated with internal control or attributions of causality or depression in this analysis. Implications for the deter-mination of prognosis and treatment recommendations in civil litigation assess-ments are discussed.

5000|$|The verses {{surrounding}} Isaiah 7:14 {{tell how}} Ahaz, {{the king of}} Judah, is told of a sign to be given in demonstration that the prophet's promise of God's protection is a true one. The sign is that an almah will {{give birth to a}} son who will still be very young when Judah's enemies will be destroyed. Most Christians identify the almah of this prophecy with the Virgin Mary. In Isaiah 7, the almah is already pregnant, and modern Jewish translators have therefore rendered almah here as [...] "young woman". The Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, which was completed in the late 2nd century BCE, translated almah into Greek as παρθένος (parthenos), which generally means [...] "virgin". For example, the Hebrew word [...] "betulah" [...] for [...] "virgin" [...] is translated as [...] "parthenon" [...] in Exodus 22:16 in the Septuagint. [...] But also, the Septuagint also describes Dinah as a parthenos even <b>after</b> she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> and hence technically no longer a virgin.|$|R

2500|$|The {{script was}} {{loosely based on}} the life of Danguolė Rasalaitė, a 16-year-old girl from Lithuania whose case had made {{headlines}} in Sweden in 2000. A male acquaintance helped Rasalaitė travel to Sweden with the promise of a job in Malmö. When she arrived, a man referred to as [...] "the Russian," [...] who would become her pimp, took her passport and told her she would have to repay him 20,000 SEK (US$2410 in 1999; $ today) for travel expenses and she was forced to prostitute herself for the next month.

Moodysson wrote the script in Swedish and then had it translated into Russian.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Lucky {{enters into}} a {{relationship}} with Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) that affects his character throughout the years. Jackson explained to Soap Opera Digest that prior to being paired with Elizabeth, the series <b>had</b> <b>been</b> hesitant to do a romantic storyline with his young character. He stated: [...] "It's a real tricky thing, especially with me growing up on the show. I mean, I was 11 when I started, so there's {{a lot of people}} watching who almost feel like parents. They're sensitive about who I get interested in. I think it's really cool to see everyone respond so positively toward [...] and toward the characters being together." [...] Lucky and Elizabeth first bond when Lucky finds Elizabeth <b>after</b> she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped.</b> He protectively cares for her, and as their on-screen relationship gradually progresses to friendship and innocent romance, the characters' off-screen popularity made them known as a supercouple. Dealing with Elizabeth's rape becomes more complicated for Lucky when he learns of the rape between his parents; he fears that he could have inherited violent sexual behaviors from his father, and could hurt Elizabeth. Elizabeth helps him deal with his fears, as well as his fallout with his parents.|$|R
50|$|Miss Jenny is {{considered}} {{an important factor in}} the British military movements in the summer of 1781. At that time, she reported to the British that the French and Americans were planning an attack on the city of New York. She {{was on her way to}} cross the lines to the city to confirm this personally when she was caught by a French guard. <b>After</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> nearly <b>raped,</b> she <b>was</b> brought to the French camp and questioned. She claimed she was searching for her French-Canadian father. The French turned her to General George Washington's camp, where she was further questioned, but she held to her story. She was then turned over to French custody again, and after a last try to make her confess, they gave up. Before releasing her, they inflicted the informal punishment of cutting off her hair as a sign of public shame. Due to the contemporary ideas about the intelligence of women, female spies were not always considered much of a threat.Miss Jenny continued on her way to the British camp in New York and reported everything she had observed. Based on her and other spies' reports, the general in charge kept his troops in New York. However, the French and Americans later changed their plan and attacked Yorktown instead.|$|R
2500|$|In the story, Lucky {{comes across}} Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) <b>after</b> she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped,</b> and confides his upset {{to his father}} before his hostile {{half-brother}} Nikolas Cassadine (then Christopher) reveals to him that Luke had raped Laura years prior. The betrayal Lucky feels from having the truth kept from him has a drastic impact on the character, especially because of how close he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> with his parents. Having moved around often, their relationship had become more like best friends than parent-child. Lucky struggles to understand his parents' actions. Jackson described Lucky in 1999 as: [...] "a black-and-white personality. He either loves or hates people. He doesn't know about balance." [...] Lucky's relationship with each of his parents suffers; he thinks his mother is in denial about her attack, and is even more angry with his father for keeping the secret while Lucky was coping with Elizabeth's assault. Lucky moves out and his independence grows further as he crashes at various places around Port Charles while holding odd jobs and continuing his schoolwork. As {{a result of the}} ordeal, honesty becomes important to Lucky; Jackson explained to Soap Opera Digest in December 1998: [...] "He doesn't want to do what his parents did as far as keeping secrets from each other and lying. He's pretty set on doing things differently {{when it comes to the}} decisions he makes in his life." ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has supported the}} views that widely accepted attitudes about rape, rape victims, and rapists (a) help sexually coercive/assaultive men justify and deny {{the negative effects of}} their behavior; and (b) severely hinder both the reporting of rape and the recovery of rape victims. This study investigated predictors of attitudes toward rape for a sample of 390 college students in the Northeastern United States. The specific attitudes considered [...] referred to as 2 ̆ 2 victim-callous 2 ̆ 2 <b>rape</b> attitudes [...] <b>were</b> (a) Women enjoy sexual violence, (b) Sex rather than power is the primary motivation for <b>rape,</b> (c) Women <b>are</b> responsible for <b>rape</b> prevention, (d) Rape happens only to certain kinds of women, (e) Women falsely report many rape claims, (f) A woman is less desirable <b>after</b> she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped,</b> and (g) <b>Rape</b> <b>is</b> justified in some situations. Variables assessing sexual experience, egalitarian gender role beliefs, adversarial sexual beliefs, macho personality, and attitudes toward female sexuality, homosexuality, extramarital sex, and premarital sex were examined for their ability to predict rape attitudes. The hypotheses suggested by previous studies were that respondents with more nonegalitarian gender role beliefs, adversarial sexual beliefs, traditional attitudes toward female sexuality, disapproving attitudes toward homosexuality, and macho personality have more victim-callous rape attitudes. ^ Data were collected by administering a questionnaire to classes of students. With exceptions of the macho personality measure which contained forced-choice items and the sexual experience measures which were short-answer items, variables were assessed by 5 -point Likert scales.

50|$|Women also {{suffer the}} worst cruelties in North Korea’s prison camps. A woman named Kim Hye-sook told the U.N. Commission that “the women {{who worked in}} the mines of Political Prison Camp No. 18 feared {{assignment}} to the night shift, because guards and prisoners preyed on them on their way to and from work and rape them.” Another witness “reported that the guards of Camp No. 18 were especially targeting teenage girls.” A former guard told of “how the camp authorities made female inmates available for sexual abuse to a very senior official who regularly visited the camp,” and that “after the official raped the women, the victims were killed.” A former guard at Camp 16 told Amnesty International that “several women inmates disappeared <b>after</b> they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> by officials,” and concluded “that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> executed secretly.” Indeed, the Commission found violence against women to be pervasive in North Korean society:318. Witnesses have testified that violence against women {{is not limited to the}} home, and that it is common to see women being beaten and sexually assaulted in public. Officials are not only increasingly engaging in corruption in order to support their low or non-existent salaries, they are also exacting penalties and punishment in the form of sexual abuse and violence as there is no fear of punishment. As more women assume the responsibility for feeding their families due to the dire economic and food situation, more women are traversing through and lingering in public spaces, selling and transporting their goods. The male dominated state, agents who police the marketplace, inspectors on trains and soldiers are increasingly committing acts of sexual assault on women in public spaces. The Commission received testimony that while <b>rape</b> of minors <b>is</b> severely punished in the DPRK, the <b>rape</b> of adults <b>is</b> not really considered a crime.|$|R

50|$|Roubej takes Florya and {{two other}} men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops, and during their retreat the group unknowingly wanders through a {{minefield}} resulting {{in the deaths of}} the two companions. That evening Roubej and Florya sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer, however Roubej and the cow are shot and killed by a German machine gun. The next morning, Florya attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Florya's identity when SS troops approach. Florya is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while the SS unit (based off the Dirlewanger Brigade) accompanied by Ukrainian collaborators surround and occupy the village. Florya tries to warn the townsfolk they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a church. Florya and a young woman bearing a strong resemblance to Glasha manage to escape; the young woman is dragged by her hair across the ground and herded into a truck to <b>be</b> gang <b>raped,</b> while Florya <b>is</b> forced to watch as grenades are thrown into the church before it is set ablaze and shot. A German officer points a gun to Florya's head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground and die as the soldiers leave. Florya later wanders out of the scorched village {{in the direction of the}} Germans, where he discovers they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> ambushed by the partisans. After recovering his jacket and rifle, Florya comes across the young woman who had also escaped the church in a fugue state <b>after</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> gang <b>raped</b> and beaten. Florya returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander. Kosach forces most of the collaborators to douse the Germans with a can of petrol, but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire, ending their lives relatively painlessly. As the partisans leave, Florya notices a framed portrait of Adolf Hitler in a puddle and shoots it - the first time he has used his rifle.|$|R
