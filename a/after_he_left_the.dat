5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a division {{that emerged in the}} early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year <b>after</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E
