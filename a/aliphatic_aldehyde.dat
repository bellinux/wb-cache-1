40|$|A novel, highly {{sensitive}} and selective fluorimetric liquid chromatographic method for simultaneous determination of medium chain <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehydes</b> was developed.

The detection limits were from 0. 19 to 0. 50. nM (1 - 10. fmol/injection) at a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3.

50|$|The Stetter {{reaction}} {{is an effective}} tool in organic synthesis. The products of the Stetter reaction, 1,4-dicarbonyls, are valuable moieties for the synthesis of complex molecules. For example, Trost and coworkers employed a Stetter reaction as one step in their synthesis of rac-hirsutic acid C. The intramolecular coupling of an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> with a tethered α,β-unsaturated ester led to the desired tricyclic 1,4-dicarbonyl in 67% yield.

50|$|In the reaction, {{a reduced}} flavin mononucleotide oxidizes a {{long-chain}} <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> to an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The reaction forms an excited hydroxyflavin intermediate, which is dehydrated {{to the product}} FMN to emit blue-green light. Nearly all of the energy input into the reaction is transformed into light. The reaction is 80% to 90% efficient. As a comparison, the incandescent light bulb only converts about 10% of its energy into light. and a 150 lumen per Watt (lm/W) LED converts 20% of input energy to visible light.|$|E

In 2001, Tius and coworkers reported the asymmetric total synthesis of roseophilin utilizing an intermolecular Stetter reaction to couple an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> with a cyclic enone. After ring-closing metathesis and alkene reduction, the 1,4-dicarbonyl product was converted to a pyrrole via the Paal-Knorr synthesis and further elaborated to the natural product.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} reaction {{that is responsible}} for bio-luminescence is catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. In the presence of oxygen, luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of an organic molecule called luciferin. Though bio-luminescence across a diverse range of organisms such as bacteria, insects, and dinoflagellates function in this general manner (utilizing luciferase and lucifierin), there are different types of luciferin-luciferase systems. For bacterial bio-luminescence specifically, the bio{{chemical reaction}} involves the oxidation of an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> by a reduced flavin mononucleotide.

50|$|The Stetter {{reaction}} produces classically {{difficult to}} access 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds and related derivatives. The traditional Stetter reaction is quite versatile, {{working on a}} wide variety of substrates. Aromatic aldehydes, heteroaromatic aldehydes, and benzoins can all be used as acyl anion precursors with thiazolium salt and cyanide catalysts. However, aliphatic aldehydes can only be utilized if a thiazolium salt is used as a catalyst, as they undergo aldol condensation side reaction when a cyanide catalyst is used. In addition, α,β-unsaturated esters, ketones, nitriles, nitros, and aldehydes are all appropriate Michael acceptors with either catalyst. However, the general scope of asymmetric Stetter reactions is more limited. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions enjoy a range of acceptable Michael acceptors and acyl anion precursors in essentially any combination. Intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions can utilize aromatic, heteroaromatic and aliphatic aldehydes with a tethered α,β-unsaturated ester, ketone, thioester, malonate, nitrile or Weinreb amide. It has been shown that α,β-unsaturated nitros and aldehydes are not suitable Michael acceptors and have markedly decreased enantiomeric excess in such reactions. Another limitation encountered with intramolecular asymmetric Stetter reactions is that only substrates that result in the formation of a six-membered ring show synthetically useful enantiomeric excess; substrates which form five and seven-membered rings either do not react or show low stereoinduction. On the other hand, intermolecular asymmetric reactions are quite confined to specifically matched combinations of acyl anion precursor and Michael acceptor, such as an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehyde</b> with a nitroalkene. In addition, these substrates tend to be rather activated, as the intermolecular asymmetric Stetter reaction is still in the early stages of development.|$|E

For most <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehydes,</b> a sharp transition from low to high diastereoselectivity was observed, indicating a distinct switch from singlet to triplet photocycloaddition with different selectivity controlling mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of solvent viscosity and temperature on the spin- directed stereoselectivity of the carbonyl-ene photocycloaddition was investigated. The variation of the solvent viscosity over a large range resulted in a weak but significant increase in the endo-selectivity of triplet benzaldehyde cycloaddition to 2, 3 -dihydrofuran from 82 to 91 %. For <b>aliphatic</b> <b>aldehydes,</b> the diastereoselectivity strongly increased with increasing solvent viscosity.

These oxazoles were versatile synthetic building blocks that reacted with various photoexcited aliphatic as well as aromatic carbonyl compounds with high regioselectvity and excellent exo-diastereoselectvity.

The effect, like the stimulation by exogenous fatty acid, exhibits specificity for the 14 -carbon compound, suggesting that tetradecanal is the natural aldehyde.
