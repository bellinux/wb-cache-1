40|$|Wind is {{the primary}} <b>abiotic</b> <b>agent</b> {{damaging}} forests. A single windstorm event can result, in one night, in losses of trees and wood volume equivalent to several years of harvest and there-fore have severe ecological and economical consequences (Lawton and Putz, 1988; Kerzenmacher and Gardiner, 1998; Fournier et al., 2006). In an attempt to predict and mitigate the effects of strong winds, many {{studies have focused on}} un-derstanding how wind forces act on trees (e. g., Mayer, 1987; Gardiner, 1994; Wood, 1995). Plant growth actively responds to wind action and to a larger extent to mechanical stimuli, a phenomenon referred to as thigmomorphogenesis (Jaffe et al., 2002). The response is characterized by adaptations of material and shape (Rowe and Speck, 2005; Telewski, 2006; Moulia et al., 2006; Br ü chert and Gardiner, 2006). The study of tree – wind interactions is essential to analyze the biomechanical effi cac...|$|E
40|$|Wind is a {{powerful}} abiotic influence on plants that is predicted to increase with global warming. The resulting changes to plant function and interaction with herbivores {{are likely to have}} significant ecological, forestry, and agricultural consequences. We used a glasshouse manipulative study to test the effects of wind exposure on a range of morphological, functional, and chemical characteristics of seedlings of Eucalyptus tereticornis, a widespread coastal tree. Chronic wind exposure (6 wk of 3 h d 1) resulted in reduced height growth and leaf area, thicker leaf cuticle, slightly higher leaf dry matter, and greater phenolic concentration. Chronic and acute (single 3 -h pulse) exposure to wind induced greater variability in minimum epidermal water conductance. The changes that occurred to seedlings show the significance of wind as an active <b>abiotic</b> <b>agent</b> in shaping plants. The changes, particularly if they are maintained or enhanced over time, may alter rates of herbivory and have the potential to lead to cascading ecological consequences that are especially relevant as climate changes...|$|E
40|$|Phytosensors are {{plants that}} are genetically {{engineered}} for sensing and reporting {{the presence of a}} specific contaminant, including agriculturally important biological agents. Phytosensors are constructed by transforming plants to contain specific biotic- or abiotic-inducible promoters fused to a reporter gene. When such transgenic plants encounter the target biotic or <b>abiotic</b> <b>agent,</b> the specific inducible promoter is triggered and subsequently drives the expression of the reporter gene, which produces a signal for detection. However, several systems lack robustness, rapid induction and promoter strength. Here, we tested the FLP/FRT recombination system in a construct containing a two gene cassette organization and examined its potential in transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants using a b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter. In this model system, a heat-shock inducible promoter was employed to control the expression of the FLP recombinase gene. Upon heat induction and subsequent active FLP-mediated excision event, the GUS gene was placed in close proximity to the 35 S promoter resulting in an active GUS reporter expression. Our results demonstrate that the two gene cassette scheme of inducible FLP/FRT recombination system is functional in tobacco and Arabidopsis, providing additional insights into its possible application in phytosensing such as creating strong readout capabilities...|$|E

40|$|We {{reported}} previously {{the isolation}} of a novel cell death-suppressing gene from maize (Zea mays) encoded by the Lls 1 (Lethal leaf spot- 1) gene. Although the exact metabolic function of LLS 1 remains elusive, here we provide insight into mechanisms that underlie the initiation and propagation of cell death associated with lls 1 lesions. Our data indicate that lls 1 lesions are triggered {{in response to a}} cell-damaging event caused by any biotic or <b>abiotic</b> <b>agent</b> or intrinsic metabolic imbalance—as long as the leaf tissue is developmentally competent to develop lls 1 lesions. Continued expansion of these lesions, however, depends on the availability of light, with fluence rate being more important than spectral quality. Double-mutant analysis of lls 1 with two maize mutants oil-yellow and iojap, both compromised photosynthetically and unable to accumulate normal levels of chlorophyll, indicated that it was the light harvested by the plant that energized lls 1 lesion development. Chloroplasts appear to be the key mediators of lls 1 cell death; their swelling and distortion occurs before any other changes normally associated with dying cells. In agreement with these results are indications that LLS 1 is a chloroplast-localized protein whose transcript was detected only in green tissues. The propagative nature of light-dependent lls 1 lesions predicts that cell death associated with these lesions is caused by a mobile agent such as reactive oxidative species. LLS 1 may act to prevent reactive oxidative species formation or serve to remove a cell death mediator so as to maintain chloroplast integrity and cell survival...|$|E

Although complex design processes are merely considered as socio-technical systems, they are deeply involved with natural systems. My collaborative {{research in the field}} of performance-oriented design combines digital and physical conceptual sketches, simulations and prototyping. GIGA -mapping - is applied to organise the data. The design process uses the most suitable tools, for the subtasks at hand, and the use of media is mixed according to particular requirements. These tools include digital and physical GIGA-mapping, parametric computer aided design (CAD), digital simulation of analyses, as well as sampling and 1 : 1 prototyping. Also discussed in this article are the methodologies used in several design projects to strategize these tools and the developments and trends in the tools employed.  The paper argues that the digital tools tend to produce similar results through given pre-sets that often do not correspond to real needs. Thus, there is a significant need for mixed methods including prototyping in the creative design process. Media mixing and cooperation across disciplines is unavoidable in the holistic approach to contemporary design. This includes the consideration of diverse biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> I argue that physical and digital GIGA-mapping is a crucial tool to use in coping with this complexity.

40|$|A major {{frontier}} {{in global}} change research is predicting how multiple agents of global change will alter plant productivity, {{a critical component}} of the carbon cycle. Recent research has shown that plant responses to climate change are phylogenetically conserved such that species within some lineages are more productive than those within other lineages in changing environments. However, it remains unclear how phylogenetic patterns in plant responses to changing abiotic conditions may be altered by another agent of global change, the introduction of non-native species. Using a system of 28 native Tasmanian Eucalyptus species belonging to two subgenera, Symphyomyrtus and Eucalyptus, we hypothesized that productivity responses to <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> of global change (elevated CO 2 and increased soil N) are unique to lineages, but that novel interactions with a non-native species mediate these responses.

40|$|Within a species, the {{distance}} travelled {{by a particular}} diaspore depends on its morphology. In Poaceae, the presence of terminal sterile florets can lead to diaspore heteromorphism, which may influence dispersal. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} presence of sterile florets favored dispersal in Bromus tectorum L., an invasive grass in the Western US. We used field and controlled experiments to study the dispersal of caryopses with and without sterile florets attached (respectively complex and simple diaspores), as well as pieces of inflorescence that detached from the mother plants. We considered both primary and secondary dispersal, as well as abiotic and biotic dispersal agents. The distance travelled by the diaspores and their attachment to animal fur were related to the presence and number of sterile florets. <b>Abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> moved diaspores over relatively short distances, both in terms of primary and secondary dispersal. A significant proportion of diaspores attached to fur, suggesting a potential for dispersal over longdistances. Complex diaspores were better dispersers than simple ones (and pieces of inflorescence), and this pattern was consistent across the study. However, among complex diaspores, the number of sterile florets had little or no influence. Considering primary and secondary dispersal by <b>abiotic</b> and biotic <b>agents</b> provided a general picture of the dispersal ecology of B. tectorum. For all the dispersal steps and dispersal agents we studied, the presence of sterile florets favored dispersal.

30|$|The {{genesis of}} calcium oxalates and of patinas {{composed}} almost exclusively by these compounds has been {{subject of a}} far-reaching debate in the scientific community. The topic is still a matter of debate. Lichens and fungi’s capacity to produce calcium oxalate has induced some authors to hypothesize that the patinas were originally produced by past biological growth {{that is no longer}} present today because of atmospheric pollution. Other authors, on the contrary, affirm that these layers have been formed through the transformation (by microorganisms or by <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents)</b> of organic substances applied on the stone for protective and/or aesthetic purposes [24]. Only in a very limited number of cases, which cannot be generalized, the patinas could be the traces of past lichenic growths (see review in [25]). Regarding Orsanmichele statues, we cannot exclude that microrganisms partially contributed to oxalates’ formation. Nonetheless, this contribution was likely limited because we did not find any remain of microrganisms in any sample observed under optical and scanning electron microscopes nor in the non-discoloured area of Sant’Eligio, a concavity between the book and the hand holding it, which is very favourable to the biofilms colonization.|$|R

If genetic origin had no influence, the values of fitness indicators in mixed groups composed of green and red individuals, would be intermediate between those of the pure green-form and red-form groups. Our results show that in a mixed group, faecal pellet production and death rate were statistically similar to the values obtained in the pure group of green-form individuals.

30|$|Many biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> can {{effectively}} induce plant resistance against various pathogens (Ramamoorthy et al. 2001; Edreva 2004). Bio-agents can induce resistance against various diseases caused by many pathogens such as viruses (Maurhofer et al. 1994), bacteria (Park and Kloepper 2000) and fungi (Bokhari and Perveen 2012). In spite of these, some bioagents such as Trichoderma spp. {{have been reported}} to promote plant growth, nutrient uptake, and induction of plant defense responses against different biotic and abiotic stresses (Harman et al. 2004; Shoresh et al. 2010; Hermosa et al. 2012). There are several evidences which support that Trichoderma spp. are able to induce the defense mechanisms in several plants (Vinale et al. 2008; Brotman et al. 2012). The results obtained through 2 D electrophoresis and high-density oligonucleotide microarrays confirmed the induction of proteome and differential gene expression in plant system when inoculated with Trichoderma spp. (Marra et al. 2006; Alfano et al. 2007; Segarra et al. 2007). Different chemical inducers such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are signal molecules that {{play a key role in}} plant growth and development, and in the induction of plant defense responses to various abiotic and biotic stress factors (Sticher et al. 1997; War et al. 2011 a, b). Various physiological, biochemical and molecular processes in plants including antioxidative enzyme activities can be manipulated by exogenous application of SA and JA (Idrees et al. 2011; War et al. 2011 a, b). SA and MeJA play a role in various signal transduction mechanisms associated with plant defense and also elicit the expression of various important enzymes catalyzing a wide array of biosynthetic reactions whose products, through a complex network results in formation of various types of defense compounds including polyphenols, alkaloids and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins (Hahlbrock and Scheel 1989; Creelman and Mullet 1995), conferring plant protection from pathogen-attack (Delaney et al. 1994; Kozlowski et al. 1999). The transcriptional reprogramming associated with plant defense responses are mediated by SA against different biotic and abiotic stresses (Herrera-Vásquez et al. 2015). Both endogenous and exogenous SA was evidenced to play roles in antioxidant metabolism and have a tight control over cellular ROS (Kang et al. 2014). In the current scenario, the plant protection provided by induction of systemic resistance is an effective and simple approach to disease management. The resistance of plants to pathogens can be enhanced by the application of various biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> However, combining different biocontrol agents with chemical inducers can significantly enhance the resistance of a plant and contribute to better control of pathogens (El-khallal 2007 a, b).|$|R

40|$|Summary: Many cabbage trees (Cordyline australis) {{are dying}} {{throughout}} much of the North Island and the northern South Island of New Zealand. The symptomatology of those dying in urban environments is described, and is concluded to be consistent with the hypothesis that death is caused by a biotic agent entering through a leafy tuft of the branch system. This disease, which has been named Sudden Decline, usually leads to almost total defoliation of affected trees within 2 - 12 months. Disease incidence has increased linearly at about 11 % per annum since 1987 / 88. Cultivated trees of C. kaspar, C. obtecta, and various Cordyline hybrids have also been observed dying with Sudden Decline symptoms. Investigations aimed at identifying the causal agent are described, and the hypothesis is advanced that a phytoplasma (mycoplasma-like organism or MLO) is the cause. Sudden Decline is contrasted with the widespread ill-health apparent in many pastoral populations of cabbage tree throughout the country. This Rural Decline is characterised by a general loss of branch and leaf vigour and occasional tree death. It is suggested that Rural Decline is a complex disease (decline disease) caused by various biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> interacting with an ageing population growing in situations where regeneration is prevented. In many pastoral situations Sudden Decline is superimposed on Rural Decline. The ecological implications of Sudden Decline are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Biofilms are {{communities}} of microorganisms {{attached to a}} surface, {{and the growth of}} these surface attached communities is thought to provide microorganisms with protection against a range of biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents.</b> The capability of the gram-negative predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus to control and reduce an existing Escherichia coli biofilm was evaluated in a static assay. A reduction in biofilm biomass was observed as early as 3 h after exposure to the predator, and an 87 % reduction in crystal violet staining corresponding to a 4 -log reduction in biofilm cell viability was seen after a 24 -h exposure period. We observed that an initial titer of Bdellovibrio as low as 102 PFU/well or an exposure to the predator as short as 30 min is sufficient to reduce a preformed biofilm. The ability of B. bacteriovorus to reduce an existing biofilm was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The reduction in biofilm biomass obtained after the first 24 h of exposure to the predator remained unchanged even after longer exposure periods and reinoculation of the samples with fresh Bdellovibrio; however, no genetically stable resistant population of the host bacteria could be detected. Our data suggest that growth in a biofilm does not prevent predation by Bdellovibrio but allows a level of survival from attack greater than that observed for planktonic cells.

Depending on the successional pathway followed, reestablishment of the prefire climax will take 200 to 400 years or more due to a rarity of extreme burning conditions. During the long period between catastrophic stand-replacing fires, {{a variety of other}} natural disturbances contribute to the varying structure and composition of vegetation and the fuel mosaic in intermountain subalpine spruce-fir forests. Disturbances may range from chronic and small scale to acute and catastrophic, resulting in a broad range of vegetative responses. In addition to crown fires, other major abiotic disturbances (I. E. landslides, mudflows, severe soil erosion, snow avalanche) and biotic disturbances (i. e. disease and insect outbreaks) control the availability of sites for the initiation of new stands of accelerated growth of understory plants and subcanopy trees. Understanding the role of natural disturbance in forest ecosystems is key to managing long-return interval fire regimes. This paper explains how the disturbance regime operating in a given landscape influences vegetative dynamics and fuel mosaics and how the state of the vegetation in turn influences these natural disturbance agents. Managers must recognize biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> of disturbance and their interactions to fully understand fire regimes and the effects of fire suppression and prescribed fire...|$|R
40|$|Various biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> {{affect the}} {{performance}} of wood products. Chemicals, thermal energy, radiation, as well as different organisms {{have the potential to}} alter the optical, haptic and functional performance of wood. These effects come along with a change of structural integrity of wood, which in turn affects its strength properties. Therefore, a test was developed to quantify the structural integrity of wood in terms of its Resistance to Impact Milling (RIM). In a High-Energy Multiple Impact (HEMI) - test, steel balls were used in a heavy vibratory mill for crushing wood samples. Thousands of single events were captured by analyzing the fragments. Based on the degree of integrity and the percentage of fine fragments (< 1 mm), an indicator has been defined to detect structural changes on cell wall level with high sensitivity. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the variation of structural integrity within and between ten different wood species in comparison with some strength properties according to standardized test protocols and in dependence of wood density. HEMI-tests, bending tests, and impact bending tests were performed with matched specimens. Wood density turned out to have only a subsidiary effect on structural integrity, but is dominanting standard strength properties. Thus, RIM was found to be only slightly correlated with the impact bending strength (IBS) and bending strength (MOR). On the other hand, the method shows clear insensitivity to natural variation in anatomy of wood...|$|R
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} low-level contamination by heavy metals (As, Cd, Cu, and Pb) {{on the soil}} health were examined by analyzing soil nematode community in soils planted with tomatoes. For this, the soils were irrigated with five metal concentrations ([1, 1 / 4, 1 / 4 ², 1 / 4 ³, and 0] × maximum concentrations [MC] detected in irrigation waters near abandoned mine sites) for 18 weeks. Heavy metal concentrations were significantly increased in soils irrigated with MC of heavy metals, among which As and Cu exceeded the maximum heavy metal residue contents of soil approved in Korea. In no heavy metal treatment controls, nematode abundances for all trophic groups (except omnivorous-predatory nematodes [OP]) and colonizer-persister (cp) values (except cp- 4 – 5) were significantly increased, and all maturity indices (except maturity index [MI] of plant-parasitic nematodes) and structure index (SI) were significantly decreased, suggesting the soil environments might have been disturbed during 18 weeks of tomato growth. There were no concentration-dependent significant decreases in richness, abundance, or MI for most heavy metals; however, their significant decreases occurred in abundance and richness of OP and cp- 4, MI 2 – 5 (excluding cp- 1) and SI, indicating disturbed soil ecosystems, at the higher concentrations (MC and MC/ 4) of Pb that had the most significant negative correlation coefficients for heavy metal concentrations and nematode community among the heavy metals. Therefore, the short-term effects of low-level heavy metal contamination on soil health can be analyzed by nematode community structures before the appearance of plant damages caused by the <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents,</b> heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{study on}} the Quercus ilex L. decay caused by biotic and <b>abiotic</b> <b>agents</b> has {{hypothesized}} alterations on endophytic and mycorrhizal fungal populations. Since holm oak is among the most representative Mediterranean species, that occurs widely in both urban and rural areas, in this work we preliminarly report these symbiotic fungal communities in asymptomatic seedlings, in order to compare these populations with those found in seedlings subjected to water and saline stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from twigs and leaves and identified by morphological and molecular analysis. The ectomycorrhizal status was evaluated on root samples randomly selected to calculate the percentage of not vital and vital ectomycorrhizal root tips. Anatomical structure of the mantle was observed to assign each mycorrhiza to a morphotype. A total of 11 fungal species were isolated and isolation frequency (IF) ranged between 0, 4 % and 16, 7 %: Alternaria alternata, Biscogniauxia nummularia, Bjerkandera adusta, Diaporthe chamaeropis, Gnomoniopsis sp., Neosetophoma samarorum, Peziza varia, Phoma pinodella, Septoria sp., Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum and a Mycelia sterilia with the highest IF. Among these, A. alternata, B. adusta and the sterile mycelium were isolated from both organs, while the other were found only on twigs or on leaves, suggesting a possible organ specificity. A total of 393 colonized root tips were present in analyzed roots, of which only the 32 % was vital. All examined tips were assigned to 2 different morphotypes. Further studies are also needed to understand the possible variability and role of these fungal communities on health status of host...|$|R
