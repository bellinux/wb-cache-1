5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the <b>arable</b> crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of <b>arable</b> land (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for <b>arable</b> agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for <b>arable</b> land in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E
5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} <b>arable</b> land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of <b>arable</b> land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{formed the}} bulk of the English economy {{at the time of the}} Norman invasion. Twenty years after the invasion, 35% of England was covered in <b>arable</b> land, 25% was put to pasture, 15% was covered by {{woodlands}} and the remaining 25% was predominantly moorland, fens and heaths. Wheat formed the single most important <b>arable</b> crop, but rye, barley and oats were also cultivated extensively. In the more fertile parts of the country, such as the Thames valley, the Midlands and the east of England, legumes and beans were also cultivated. Sheep, cattle, oxen and pigs were kept on English holdings, although most of these breeds were much smaller than modern equivalents and most would have been slaughtered in winter.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is {{intensive}} and highly mechanised, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Two thirds of production {{is devoted to}} livestock, the other to <b>arable</b> crops.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} {{now appears to}} be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. The perceived decline {{may be due to the}} loss of invertebrate-rich pastures and mixed farms through conversion to <b>arable</b> agriculture or more intensively managed grassland. Adult survival, clutch size and fledging success are all lower in <b>arable</b> landscapes than in areas with extensive pasture. In Finland, the loss of ancient forests is thought to have led to a local decline.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the <b>arable</b> or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. <b>Arable</b> farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, in Wales {{there were}} 1,048,000 {{hectares}} under permanent grass, a further 437,000 hectares were rough grassland, 87,000 hectares were woodland and 239,000 hectares were <b>arable</b> land (including temporary grassland). The number of horses for agricultural purposes are {{not mentioned in}} the statistics, but there were 290,000 dairy cows, 214,000 other cattle, 28,400 pigs and 9,739,000 sheep in the country. There were also 945 <b>arable</b> and horticultural holdings, 1,753 dairy farms, 12,650 beef and sheep farms, 95 specialist pig units and 426 specialist poultry units.|$|E
5|$|The main {{economic}} sector in Tubas is agriculture. There {{is a total}} of 150,000 dunams of <b>arable</b> land, of which 124,450 dunams are covered by forests and 10,604 dunams cultivated. Although the land is fertile, {{there is a lack}} of water for irrigation. The only spring used is the nearby Ein Far'a. Field crops account for 49% of the cultivable land, while fruit orchards account for 40% and vegetables make-up 11%. Israeli trenches around the neighboring villages of Ras al-Ahmar and Khirbet al-'Atuf prevent access to nearly 40% of Tubas' <b>arable</b> lands.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the chapter}} covers Pre-Roman, Western (i.e. Celtic) and Roman Britain. He {{estimates}} very roughly that 750,000 acres at most were in use as <b>arable</b> or grassland in Roman times, compared to 27 million acres in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A Carmelite priory {{was founded}} in 1354, but was {{demolished}} soon after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. The site passed to various people and was used for <b>arable</b> farming before a workhouse {{was built on the}} site in 1857, subsequently the Friarage Hospital which takes its name from the friary was built. Following development of the site in 2006, archaeologists uncovered the remains of eight monks along with other artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for <b>arable</b> cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. <b>Arable</b> cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As {{a percentage of the}} available <b>arable</b> land compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire {{proposed}} international mediation, Cuza {{took the}} initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In {{order to prevent}} further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek {{as well as those}} of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, one third of the <b>arable</b> land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total <b>arable</b> land in the state as a whole).|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, farming was {{the most}} {{important}} activity in the area, and farming, both <b>arable</b> and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived in}} Hvalstad, Asker, where {{he owned a}} nine decare small farm. The {{property}} included three equal parts of garden, forest and <b>arable</b> land. He often cut lumber from the forest to build his own furniture. At various times, he had rabbits, sheep, cows, calves, piglets and a fish pond of brown trout at his property. According to himself, he kept the livestock largely in protest against tax authorities, while also as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of people lost their homes, but many took {{this as an opportunity to}} rebuild stronger houses. With a new, structurally improved foundation, homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane. However, lack of <b>arable</b> crop land took away the jobs from many, decreasing an already low income even lower.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into <b>arable</b> production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In 'The Clearing of the Woodlands', Hoskins {{argues that}} before the 15th century England must have looked like one great forest, {{but most of the}} woods were cleared for <b>arable</b> or pasture in the 12th and 13th centuries. Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, <b>arable</b> farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly <b>arable.</b> The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial <b>arable</b> farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
5|$|It {{seems that}} most of the Romano-British sites were {{abandoned}} by the 5th century and the <b>arable</b> land reverted to scrub and woodland. Arriving in the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons began to clear the land again. Bletchley ("Blaeca's clearing") and Shenley ("Bright clearing") date from this period. Large settlements have been excavated at Pennyland and near Milton Keynes Village. Their cemeteries have been found at Newport Pagnell, Shenley and Tattenhoe.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Lincoln {{offers a}} wider variety of work, with its economy based mainly on public administration, commerce, <b>arable</b> farming and tourism. Over the past few years, Lincoln has also seen rapid {{development}} in its retail sector, in an attempt to compete with the neighbouring cities of Nottingham and Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's good <b>arable</b> and {{pastoral}} land is found {{mostly in the}} south and east of the country. Heavy rainfall, wind and salt spray, in combination with thin soil and overgrazing, made most of the western islands treeless. The terrain often made internal land communication difficult, encouraging a coastal network. In the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming. The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk. From the Bronze Age, <b>arable</b> land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re-growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and <b>arable</b> conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E
5|$|The islanders' {{livelihood}} {{was based}} on fishing (for white fish, herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of <b>arable</b> and pasture land fertilised by wrack on which sheep, cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in fachaich or ‘fatlings’ - shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{pedosphere}} is {{the outermost}} layer of Earth's continental surface and {{is composed of}} soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total <b>arable</b> land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3km2 of cropland and 3.4km2 of pastureland.|$|E
5|$|York {{lies in the}} Vale of York, a {{flat area}} of fertile <b>arable</b> land bordered by the Pennines, the North York Moors and the Yorkshire Wolds The city was built at the {{confluence}} of the Rivers Ouse and Foss on a terminal moraine left by the last Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|About 78% of {{the land}} surface of Wales is given over to {{agricultural}} use.), Wales area 20,779 km2 However, very little of this is <b>arable</b> land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep and cows. Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely <b>arable,</b> providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|By the Elizabeth period, Dunham Massey Castle {{had been}} demolished. Probably during the medieval period, Dunham Massey Hall became {{the home of}} the manorial lord, and a centre of power in the area. The hall was rebuilt in 1616, leaving no remains of the old medieval manor house. A mill at Dunham was {{documented}} in 1353, although the its present structure dates to the 1860s. It lies on the River Bollin, opposite Little Bollington. The first record of Dunham's deer park was also in 1353. The settlement at Dunham Woodhouse (named after an outlying lodge on the estate) dates from the 15th century. During the medieval period, the primary source of employment was agriculture, mainly <b>arable</b> farming.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South Vietnam {{to identify}} {{areas that were}} suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for <b>arable</b> land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss {{makes up}} the largest area of prime {{farmland}} in Greater Manchester, but farming on the moss is in decline. In 2003, {{it was reported that}} of the 54farms on the moss, occupying , almost half the area of the bog, only three were growing vegetables. Others had turned to <b>arable</b> farming, turf growing or horse livery instead of salad and vegetable crops. Chat Moss also contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in Greater Manchester.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the <b>arable</b> valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the <b>arable</b> land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|Examination of peat cores and pollen records {{indicates}} that soil erosion (suggesting clearance of woodland for agricultural purposes) {{was taking place}} in 3470 BC (the early Neolithic era); much later, from 2460 BC, evidence of <b>arable</b> cultivation exists. As the climate became damper, peat expanded its coverage {{at the expense of}} woodland, and post-glacial sea level changes left raised beaches around the coastline 18–45metres above the present sea-level, especially between Harris and A'Bhrideanach; Bronze Age artefacts, such as barbed-and-tanged arrowheads typical of the Beaker People, have been found in the machair which replaced it.|$|E
5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for <b>arable</b> land. Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of the capital Sydney, including one to find an overland route to Jervis Bay, an area which would later be incorporated into the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 Charles Throsby, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.|$|E
