5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early recipe, from 1902, {{suggests}} frying the skewered oysters <b>and</b> <b>bacon</b> in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by {{losses to}} the Akron Pros, the Triangles did not contend for the APFA trophy in 1920. The Triangles' {{performance}} of 5–2–2 {{would be the}} team's best before folding in 1929.

5|$|The keel for Louisiana {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 7 February 1903. Her {{completed}} hull was launched on 27 August 1904, and she was commissioned into the fleet on 2 June 1906. The ship then conducted a shakedown cruise {{off the coast of}} New England before being ordered to Cuba. She left the United States on 15 September with Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Assistant Secretary of State Robert Bacon aboard; they were requested as a peace commission by Cuban President Tomás Estrada Palma to suppress an insurrection in the country. Taft <b>and</b> <b>Bacon</b> helped to create a provisional government, during which time Louisiana remained in Cuba.

5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge <b>and</b> <b>bacon</b> and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had been}} {{painting}} for almost twenty years, Bacon steadfastly insisted that Three Studies was the fons et origo of his career. He destroyed many of his earlier canvasses, and tried to suppress those that had left his studio. Bacon was emphatic that no pre-1944 images be admitted into his canon, {{and most of the}} early art critics agreed with this position. The early publications of John Russell and David Sylvester open with the 1944 triptych, <b>and</b> <b>Bacon</b> insisted to his death that no retrospective should feature paintings pre-dating 1944.|$|E

Following this the Japanese withdrew back towards the mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations, and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river.
