5|$|Although {{designed}} as a liberal arts-oriented university, UCSC quickly acquired a graduate-level natural science research component with the appointment of plant physiologist Kenneth V. Thimann as the first provost of Crown College. Thimann developed UCSC's early Division of Natural Sciences and recruited other well-known science faculty and graduate students to the fledgling campus. Immediately upon its founding, UCSC was also granted <b>administrative</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the Lick Observatory, which established the campus as a major center for astronomy research. Founding members of the Social Science and Humanities faculty created the unique History of Consciousness graduate program in UCSC's first year of operation.|$|E
5|$|The Western Ganga {{society in}} many ways {{reflected}} the emerging religious, political and cultural developments of those times. Women became active in local administration because Ganga kings distributed territorial responsibility to their queens such as the feudal queen Parabbaya-arasi of Kundattur and the queens of King Sripurusha, Butuga II and feudal king Permadi. Inheritance of fiscal and <b>administrative</b> <b>responsibility</b> by the son-in-law, the wife or by the daughter is evident. The position of prime minister of King Ereganga II and position of nalgavunda (local landlord) bestowed upon Jakkiabbe, {{the wife of a}} fallen hero are examples. When Jakkiabbe took to asceticism, her daughter inherited the position.|$|E
5|$|When the Korean War {{broke out}} on 25June 1950, No.77 (Fighter) Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was based at Iwakuni, Japan. For the {{previous}} four years the squadron, equipped with North American P-51 Mustangs, had served with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Personnel were preparing to return to Australia when they were placed on standby for action over Korea; the squadron began flying missions as part of United Nations (UN) forces a week later. Following the landing at Inchon and the consequent advance northward of UN troops, No.77 Squadron relocated to Pohang, South Korea, on 12October 1950. It left behind its main support elements at Iwakuni. No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at the base on 20October and given <b>administrative</b> <b>responsibility</b> for all RAAF units operating during the conflict. This included No.77 Squadron and three newly formed components: No.30 Communications Flight (renamed No.30 Communications Unit the following month, No.30 Transport Unit in November 1951 and No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953), No.491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and No.391 (Base) Squadron. Apart from No.77 Squadron, the wing's units were all headquartered at Iwakuni.|$|E

The flight's original complement of two Dakotas and two Austers had been augmented in September 1950 by two more Dakotas from Australia. On 1November, the flight was designated No.30 Communications Unit.|$|E

The office had the status of a full ministry and was headed by officials of equal rank.

25|$|During this time, the Anglican Church assumed {{de facto}} <b>administrative</b> <b>responsibility</b> in the far-flung {{wilderness}} of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials {{and later the}} federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations – a decision which {{would come back to}} haunt it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, among other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language: the merits and demerits of that system in a broad sense, such as they were, have latterly been entirely overwhelmed by the issue of the wholly reprehensible abuse of some of its child wards by sexually disordered mission personnel. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga'a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 and was the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.|$|E
