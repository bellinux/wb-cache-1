Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>station,</b> while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
