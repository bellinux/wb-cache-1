All sixteen are held in the National Museum of Natural History as specimens USNM 107855 and USNM 107856. A few living specimens were taken to Wayland College (now Wayland Baptist University), but died within 17 hours for unknown reasons. Two of the females laid eggs before dying, one laying 3,000 and the other 8,000.|$|E

25|$|Viewed using calculus, {{the circle}} {{transition}} function T {{is simply a}} function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that T is differentiable. The transition map T, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> are differentiable on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a differentiable manifold. It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the quarter}} final, Sri Lanka met South Africans. The match {{was a shock}} to all the fans across the globe, where Sri Lanka scored 133 runs all out. Sanga scored 45 runs <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were {{struggled}} by South African impressive bowling attack- Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. South Africa won the match very easily, only one wicket fell. With this match, Sanga and Jayawardena ended their ODI career. This match gave Lankans, their first defeat without making for the semi-finals after 1999 World Cup.|$|E

[...] There was further difficulties in production as Zicree also hired a professional assistant director, but he walked off set during a night shoot early in the production and did not return. Cawley later said [...] "Marc is all about using this production to further his own career, a stark difference between his goal <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> who were there doing it, did we aspire to be a pro-looking production? Yup. And we were and are proud of it. Did we take salaries and/or compensation? Nope. That was a tough episode to shoot for many reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} and is cruciform in shape. [...] Its plan {{consists of a}} four-bay nave with north and south aisles, a south porch with two storeys, a central tower, north and south transepts, and a three-bay chancel, {{to the north of}} which is a two-storey treasury. [...] The tower is square below and octagonal above. [...] Both transepts are of three bays and the northernmost bay of the north transept was formerly a Lady chapel. [...] The other two bays were dedicated to Saint George. [...] The south transept was known as the Kingsley Chapel. [...] Pevsner, in addition to complaining about some aspects of Scott's restoration, comments on the abrupt change from the Decorated to the Perpendicular style, no doubt the consequence of the interruption to building work caused by the Black Death. [...] This is particularly so in the chancel where the side windows are [...] "very rich Decorated", with crocketed gables and highly decorated buttresses and pinnacles, while the seven-light east window, also under a crocketed gable, is [...] "pure Perpendicular". [...] The aisle windows and all the windows in the north transept are Decorated, while in the south transept one window is Decorated <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> are Perpendicular. [...] The bell-openings in the tower are Decorated. [...] Pevsner describes the tower as being the [...] "crowning motif" [...] of the church.|$|E

2500|$|A {{total of}} 41 {{compositions}} of Niccolò have survived with reliable attribution, {{the majority of}} them in the Squarcialupi Codex, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> from sources in Tuscany.

[...] The madrigals are all for two voices, except for one which uses three, and all are in a relatively conservative style, uninfluenced by contemporary French practice (thereby differing from the similar works of Landini). Sacchetti's records of his poetry that was set to music includes the titles of several other pieces by Niccolò that do not survive.|$|E

2500|$|Modern Turkey {{was founded}} by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk as secular (Laiklik, Turkish {{adaptation}} of French Laïcité), i.e. without a state religion, or separate ethnic divisions/ identities. The concept of [...] "minorities" [...] has only been accepted by the Republic of Turkey {{as defined by the}} Treaty of Lausanne of 1924 and thence strictly limited to Greeks, Jews and Armenians, only on religious matters, excluding from the scope of the concept the ethnic identities of these minorities as of others such as the Kurds who make up 15% of the country; others include Assyrians/Syriacs of various Christian denominations, Alevis <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Anti-parallel {{alignment}} {{is therefore}} not quite as serious as saturation but must still be avoided. It is theoretically possible with any number of CMGs; as long as some rotors are aligned parallel along a particular axis, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> point in exactly the opposite direction, there is no saturation but still no roll control about that axis. With three or more CMGs the situation can be immediately rectified simply by redistributing the existing total angular momentum among the rotors (even if that total is zero). [...] In practice the CMG control program will continually redistribute the total angular momentum to avoid the situation arising in the first place.|$|E

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that [...] "after many weeks had passed, some of the heathen [...] died of hunger, but some, having by then eaten their horses, broke out of the fortress, and joined battle with those who were on the east bank of the river. But, when many thousands of pagans had been slain, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> had been put to flight, the Christians [...] were masters of the place of death.

Finally, Húrin {{was the only one}} left, and during this very last phase of the battle he killed no fewer than seventy of Morgoth's soldiers. But Morgoth gave orders that Húrin was to be taken alive, and the corpses of Orcs eventually became so numerous that at the end he fell trapped beneath a pile of them. The battle thus ending, Gothmog bound him and dragged him to Angband.|$|E
2500|$|In {{relation}} to his later work, Northrop Frye sees All Religions are One and There is No Natural Religion as forming a fundamental {{statement of intent}} for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, [...] "a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon." [...] Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they [...] "contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art." [...] W.H. Stevenson calls them [...] "a very early statement of fundamental opinions [...] held all his life." [...] As {{an example of how}} Blake returned to the specific themes of All Religions, in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790), he writes [...] "the Poetic Genius was the first principle <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> merely derivative" [...] (12:22–24).|$|E

Yet the deeds of these men were such that they deserve to be praised for all time." [...] He claims that he was given a source for this period by Archdeacon Walter of Oxford, who presented him with a [...] "certain very ancient book written in the British language" [...] from which he has translated his history. He also cites Gildas and Bede as sources. Then follows a dedication to Robert, earl of Gloucester and Waleran, count of Meulan, whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.|$|E
