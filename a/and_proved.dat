The game sold over 70,000 arcade {{cabinets}} <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. Asteroids was widely imitated and directly influenced Defender, Gravitar, and many other video games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. GRM <b>and</b> <b>PROVE</b> were {{originally}} designed and implemented {{as part of}} the P-GRADE graphical parallel program development environment running on clusters. In the framework of the biggest European Grid project, the DataGrid project we investigated the possibility of transforming GRM <b>and</b> <b>PROVE</b> to a Grid monitoring infrastructure. This paper presents the results of this work showing how to separate GRM <b>and</b> <b>PROVE</b> from the P-GRADE system and to turn them into standalone Grid monitoring tools...|$|R

The {{marriage}} was resented by the Nansen children, <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> unhappy; an acquaintance writing of them in the 1920s said Nansen appeared unbearably miserable and Sigrun steeped in hate.|$|E
5|$|The City {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics, <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> less successful than The Hills.

The show has distributed all seasons to DVD.|$|E

40|$|Research {{across many}} {{countries}} reports that teaching the key ideas of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> {{to all students}} {{is not an easy}} task. This paper reports on the session of the BSRLM Geometry Working Group which examined current classroom material from the UK with the intention of uncovering the ‘opportunities for proof’ in geometry that are provided by such material. To carry out such an analysis three analytical frameworks are compared. Two of the analytical frameworks, while placing proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> in a wider context of learners’ mathematics, may not fully uncover the detail of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving.</b> The third analytical framework, while permitting a detailed analysis of explicit proof <b>and</b> <b>proving,</b> may not fully account for textbooks that devote most space to discussions of proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> and/or contain problems that implicitly provoke proof. This comparison reveals some of the complexity of textbook analysis and suggests that further work is needed on a suitable analytical framework...|$|R

5|$|After a slow start, {{in early}} 1942, Cascade {{began to take}} effect. As early as May, Axis {{intelligence}} began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%. In July the operation expanded. Clarke introduced more and more fictitious divisions {{and by the end}} of the year the Germans had accepted many of them as real formations. By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> that deception on a grand scale was a realistic strategy.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included developing {{a new version of}} the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E

In this research, the prospective teachers’ proof perceptions, the effect of proof perceptions to the process of proving; whether their attitudes towards proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> differentiate concerning their proof perceptions were studied. It was found that the types of proof perceptions of the prospective teachers had an effect on the process of <b>proving</b> <b>and</b> their attitudes towards proof <b>and</b> <b>proving</b> could change concerning their proof perception.

We also define stable multi-conclusion consequence relations and stable logics <b>and</b> <b>prove</b> that these systems have the finite model property.

Olaf, however, ultimately returned to Norway, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons.

5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|Dumbo, in {{production}} during {{the midst of}} the animators' strike, premiered in October 1941 <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> to be a financial success. The simple film only cost $950,000 to produce, half the cost of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, {{less than a third of}} the cost of Pinocchio, and two-fifths of the cost of Fantasia. Dumbo eventually grossed $1.6 million during its original release. In August 1942, Bambi was released, and as with Pinocchio and Fantasia, did not perform well at the box office. Out of its $1.7 million budget, it only grossed $1.64 million.|$|E

The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, <b>and</b> <b>proved</b> to be popular among children, teenagers, and adults.

He created a spacetime-oriented description of gravitational lensing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of Newtonian gravity.
