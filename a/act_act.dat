25|$|Until recently, {{there were}} tax {{advantages}} to living trusts in South Africa, {{although most of}} these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency <b>Act</b> (<b>Act</b> 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent {{at the time of}} transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).|$|E

2500|$|As {{soon as the}} <b>ACT</b> <b>act</b> {{had been}} passed, the Commonwealth {{launched}} a challenge {{to it in the}} High Court, which delivered judgment on 12 December 2013. As to the relation between the <b>ACT</b> <b>act</b> and federal legislation, the Court found that the <b>ACT</b> <b>act</b> was invalid and of [...] "no effect", because it was [...] "inconsistent", in terms of the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government Act 1988 (Cth), with the federal Marriage Act 1961 (Cth). It was inconsistent both because its definition of marriage conflicted with that in the federal act and because the federal act was exclusive, leaving no room for any other definition in legislation of a state or a territory. However, the Court went on to determine that the word [...] "marriage" [...] in Constitution s51(xxi) includes same-sex marriage, thus clarifying that there is no constitutional impediment to the Commonwealth legislating for same-sex marriage in the future. It can do so by amending the definition of [...] "marriage" [...] in the Marriage Act.|$|E
