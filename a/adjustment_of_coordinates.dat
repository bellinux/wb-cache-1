To get optimal movements of the control points it is important to define the station point with optimal precision. For this purpose thesis work is dealing with optimisation of geodetic measurements. In surveying the optimisation of measurements is carried out to assure some criteria. The criterion and the basic aim of thesis is to define such measurements' weights that their inclusion in adjustment causes the ellipsoid of station point to become a sphere. Therefore with a programme Matlab 7. 0 <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> station <b>coordinates</b> and second order optimisation were carried out.

The results <b>of</b> the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the transformation are the transformation parameters and residuals that is deviations <b>of</b> <b>coordinates</b> <b>of</b> points in the target coordinate system.

This paper presents evidence based on a data set of 33 daily international stock market indices. Initially, using established cointegration and multivariate GARCH frameworks, we report results that suggest correlations with the US have not in general exhibited an upward trend. The main exception to this is the G 7 economies, although even here the correlations declined over {{the last part of the}} sample. On a regional basis there is stronger evidence of rising correlations, notably in Europe, although again this evidence is not ubiquitous. Further, we also implement the recently developed non-parametric, model-free and realised variance methodology to generate correlation coefficients. This method overcomes deficiencies in both the cointegration and GARCH methods. The results here largely support those of the GARCH analysis. Finally, we use the time-varying correlation methods to form international portfolios and compare their performance to that of an equally weighted portfolio. Results suggest that accounting for time-variation is particularly beneficial for the larger markets but more marginal for the smaller markets. Our results thus suggest that there remains room for portfolio managers to obtain diversification benefits, while policy makers may need to take in account possible <b>adjustment</b> costs <b>of</b> <b>coordinated</b> action. financial cointegration; correlation; multivariate GARCH; realised volatility; international stock markets; financial market co-movement; time variation. ...|$|R

40|$|The 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion is {{the most}} widely used rat model of Parkinson's disease. A single {{unilateral}} injection of 6 -OHDA into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) selectively destroys dopamine neurons in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), removing more than 95 % of the dopamine innervation from target areas. The stereotaxic coordinates used to deliver 6 -OHDA to the MFB have been used in our laboratory successfully for more than 25 years. However, in recent years we have observed a decline in the success rate of this lesion. Previously regular success rates of > 80 % of rats lesioned, have become progressively more variable, with rates as low as 20 % recorded in some experiments. Having excluded variability of the neurotoxin and operator errors, we hypothesized that the change seen might be due to the use of smaller rats at the time of first surgery. An attempt to proportionally adjust the lesion coordinates base on head size did not increase lesion efficacy. However, in support of the small rat hypothesis it was observed that, using the standard coordinates, rat's heads had a “nose-up” position in the stereotaxic fame. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the nose bar to obtain a flat head position during surgery improved lesion success, and subsequent <b>adjustments</b> <b>of</b> the lesion <b>coordinates</b> to account for smaller head size led to a greatly increased lesion efficacy (> 90 %) as assessed by amphetamine induced rotation...|$|R

MethodsData quality control procedures were applied, including taxonomic standardization, removal <b>of</b> duplicates, and <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> geographical <b>coordinates.</b> Vegetation types and climate parameters {{were assigned to}} each sample. Modern pollen distribution maps were drawn using circle scattergrams. The plots of pollen percentages versus climate variables allowed quantitative estimates of climate values. The modern analogue technique (MAT) was used to predict modern biomes and climate parameters. ResultsPollen assemblages extracted from 2858 sites were used to model the geographical distribution of selected taxa and their relationships with climate. For most taxa, the reconstructed range fitted the observed geographical distribution rather well. Arboreal pollen (AP) and Pinus dominated the transition zone between forest and steppe. Use of the MAT revealed that the predicted and observed biomes matched in 71 % of the cases. The warm temperate evergreen broadleaf forest had the best agreement between predictions and observations. Climate values reconstructed using MAT were highly correlated with observed values in January temperature. The correlation coefficient of the temperature variables ranged from 0. 799 to 0. 930 and was as high as 0. 939 for precipitation.

40|$|A {{basic problem}} of visual {{perception}} {{is how we}} recognize objects after spatial transformations. Three central classes of findings have to be accounted for: (1) Recognition performance varies systematically with orientation, size, and position. (2) Recognition latencies are sequentially additive, suggesting analog transformation processes. (3) Orientation and size congruency effects indicate that recognition involves the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> a perceptual <b>coordinate</b> system. While existing models of object recognition are unable to account for all three types of findings, the data {{can be explained by}} a transformational model of recognition (TMR), which relies on coordinate transformations and multiple representations. Recognition is achieved by transforming a generic perceptual coordinate system that defines the correspondence between positions specified in memory and positions in the current visual field so that memory and input representations are aligned. TMR is an analog model of recognition, based on analog (image -like) representations and analog transformation processes. TMR is compatible with models in computational neuroscience proposing that object recognition involves coordinate transformations, implemented by neural gain (amplitude) modulation. These gain modulation processes correspond to transformations of receptive fields in upstream cortical areas. Coordinate transformations seem to underlie both object recognition and visuomotor control, and may be regarded as a general processing principle of the visual cortex. TMR discriminates between compensation processes in object recognition and mental imagery; coordinate transformations in recognition are more closely related to visuomotor control than to mental rotation.

Fitting a straight line to 3 D points, a process hardly noticed in least squares textbooks, is extremely useful in high-precision deformation check and a lot of industrial survey applications. © ASCE...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a theorethical model that tries to {{investigate}} the observable hysteresis process in the migration dynamic. In the model the migration choice depends {{not only on the}} wage differential, but also on a U-shaped benefit function of a community of homogenous ethnic individuals, modelled according to the "theory of clubs". The theoretical results, based on real option theory, explain that the observable "jumps" in the migration flows could depend on two variables: the number <b>of</b> <b>coordinated</b> immigrants and the dimension of the community. In fact, the migration choice is procrastinated until a critical mass is reached. Moreover, some possible rigidities in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the district dimension, as regards the optimal levels, can magnify the hysteresis process. ...|$|R
