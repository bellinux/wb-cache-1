40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} how common <b>serving</b> <b>bowls</b> containing food for multiple persons influence serving behavior and consumption {{and whether they}} do so independently of satiation and food evaluation. Methods: In this between-subjects experiment, 68 participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either <b>a</b> group <b>serving</b> pasta from <b>a</b> large-sized bowl (6. 9 -L capacity) or a medium-sized bowl (3. 8 -L capacity). Results: Analysis of covariance showed that when given <b>a</b> large-sized <b>bowl,</b> diners <b>served</b> 77 % more pasta (364. 0 versus 205. 5 g; P . 32). Conclusions and Implications: In contrast to those in studies involving larger-sized plates and spoons, people <b>serving</b> from larger <b>bowls</b> felt more satiated. These findings again highlight the role that external cues play in food consumption and show the importance of considering <b>serving</b> <b>bowl</b> size in nutrition education...|$|R
