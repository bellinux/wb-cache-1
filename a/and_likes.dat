50|$|Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory (1993) {{proposed}} that reward contains separable psychological components: wanting (incentive) <b>and</b> <b>liking</b> (pleasure). To explain increasing {{contact with a}} certain stimulus such as chocolate, there are two independent factors at work - our desire to have the chocolate (wanting) and the pleasure effect of the chocolate (liking). According to Robinson and Berridge, wanting <b>and</b> <b>liking</b> are two aspects of the same process, so rewards are usually wanted <b>and</b> <b>liked</b> to the same degree. However, wanting <b>and</b> <b>liking</b> also change independently under certain circumstances. For example, rats that do not eat after receiving dopamine (experiencing a loss of desire for food) act as though they still like food. In another example, activated self-stimulation electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus of rats increase appetite, but also cause more adverse reactions to tastes such as sugar and salt; apparently, the stimulation increases wanting but not liking. Such results demonstrate that our reward system includes independent processes of wanting <b>and</b> <b>liking.</b> The wanting component {{is thought to be}} controlled by dopaminergic pathways, whereas the liking component is thought to be controlled by opiate-benzodiazepine systems.|$|R
