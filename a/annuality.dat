This is also underlined by the EU Flood Directive. The flood related authorities therefore have to develop adjusted information tools which meet the demands of different user groups. This article presents the formative evaluation of flood hazard maps and web mapping services according to the specific requirements and needs of the general public using the dynamic-transactional approach as a theoretical framework. The evaluation was done by a mixture of different methods; an analysis of existing tools, a creative workshop with experts and laymen and an online survey. The currently existing flood hazard maps or web mapping services or web GIS still lack a good balance between simplicity and complexity with adequate readability and usability for the public. Well designed and associative maps (e. g. using blue colours for water depths) which can be compared with past local flood events and which can create empathy in viewers, can help to raise awareness, to heighten the activity and knowledge level or can lead to further information seeking. Concerning web mapping services, a linkage between general flood information like flood extents of different scenarios and corresponding water depths and real time information like gauge levels is an important demand by users. Gauge levels of these scenarios are easier to understand than the scientifically correct return periods or <b>annualities.</b> The recently developed Bavarian web mapping service tries to integrate these requirements...|$|R

40|$|An annual {{life history}} is {{often viewed as}} a model {{adaptation}} to arid environments. <b>Annuality</b> is predicted to have evolved in response to low adult survival and high seedling survival. In this study I evaluated the idea that increases in aridity should {{be associated with the}} evolution of an annual life history. I also investigated the correlated evolution of <b>annuality</b> and growth form. Ancestral character states for life history characters and climate variables were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny (obtained using plastid trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH and nuclear ETS sequences) of the genera Trichogyne and Ifloga (Asteraceae). Bayesian methods were used for phylogeny inference and maximum likelihood methods for ancestral state reconstructions. Only two phylogenetically independent contrasts were obtained and so the association between changes from <b>annuality</b> to perenniality and increases in aridity along branches of the tree were recorded and evaluated using Fisher's exact test. In order to account for ancestral character state reconstruction uncertainty, four different possible scenarios suggested by the maximum likelihood methods for the evolution of <b>annuality</b> were examined. This is the first molecular phylogeny of the group. Bayesian analysis of the sequence data places the Trichogyne+ Ifloga clade within the Gnaphileae. The genus Ifloga is shown to be paraphyletic. Trichogyne ambigua, as currently described, is polyphyletic and may contain two species. The origin of the Trichogyne+ Ifloga clade is within southern Africa and a northwards migration via the arid corridor is suggested to explain the disjunct distribution of the two Northern Hemisphere species. There is an association between the duration of the moisture growing season and the evolution of <b>annuality.</b> This is consistent with the idea that <b>annuality</b> is favoured by long drought periods making perennation difficult. The evolution of <b>annuality</b> was correlated with a non-woody, tufted, growth form.

40|$|There is scant {{information}} {{available on the}} occurrence of fire in the Eastern Tiers of Tasmania. Whole, very large and fire scarred eucalypt cross sections were used as source material for the reconstruction of a fire history for this region. Accurate dating of fire scars in Eucalyptus has been problematic due to the unreliable nature of the <b>annuality</b> of growth rings. Eucalypts have a proclivity for growth anomalies such as false and or missing rings. The <b>annuality</b> of eucalypt tree rings was assessed using dendrochronological techniques on a sub-set each of young trees 150 yrs (n = 27). A software program was developed to assist with data capture and analysis. “Detect Rings” identified ring boundaries and measured ring widths from high resolution photographs. However, the seven sampled eucalypt species (E. amygdalina, E. obliqua, E. dalrympleana, E. tenuiramis, E. delegatensis, E. pulchella, E. globulus), were not amenable to withinor between-tree cross-dating. Multiple radial ring counts from 104 large trees (photographs: n = 27, in situ: n = 77) were aggregated and tested for reliability with a mean error margin of ± 7 rings being calculated where tree age was estimated at > 200 years. Additional sources of error were progressively eliminated. The integrity of fire scar capture from thirteen sites, each with variable sample numbers, was addressed by the development and application of a sample size adjustment procedure analogous to the bootstrap. This process indicated that 9 - 10 sample trees per site were sufficient to detect {{a high proportion of}} fire events large enough to generate injurious fire scars. There was no effect on fire scar distribution resulting from tree age, species composition, landscape position, bark thickness, diameter over bark, slope or elevation.

40|$|The genetic {{architecture}} of various floral and morphological differences between Mimulus cupriphilus and Mimulus guttatus is investigated. M. cupriphilus {{is believed to}} have speciated from M. guttatus in the recent past. The two parent species, the F(1) and F(2), and two backcrosses were grown and scored for 23 different characters. The analysis of means revealed significant epistasis for a number of the floral characters, particularly those involving the length of parts. Dominance was generally toward M. guttatus, except for the characters related to flowering time. Analysis of the genetic correlations between characters revealed that there were at least four different polygenic genetic systems, governing flowering time, size of flower, number of spots on the corolla, and general size. An analysis of minimum gene number suggested that there were at least 3 - 7 genes controlling floral size, and a different three controlling floral spot number. Two other characters, corolla lobe shape and stem color, were produced by independent major gene differences. <b>Annuality</b> was also shown to be heritable. The two species appear to utilize the same gene for copper tolerance. The results are discussed in the light of current theories of speciation...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction] The first EU {{budget was}} drafted in 1988 under the {{so-called}} “Delors Package I. ” Its budgetary headings and monetary distribution have remained unchanged until 14 th July 2004, when the Commission adjusted its traditional model {{to a new}} system of headings to adapt the budget to an evolutionary economical environment. The budget of the European Union distinguishes itself from other international bodies by its exclusive system of the so-called “own resources. ” This system is composed of the revenues obtained by (1) the Common Customs duties collected under the external tariff; (2) the levies in imported agricultural products; (3) the Value Added Tax revenue; and (4) the Gross National Income based resources. The EU budget sets out and authorizes the total amount of revenues and expenditures annually deemed necessary by the European Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. However, the EU budget is a seven-year multi-annual spending plan articulated around a ¨financial framework¨ that ensures the control of the evolution of the budget expenditure. The budget is drafted and implemented under the ¨Financial Programming and Budget¨ Directorate General and is supervised by the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors. The EU budget not only rests on the three basic accounting principles: unity, <b>annuality</b> and balance, which guarantee its economic efficiency, but also on the composition of its revenues, the so-called “own resources. ...|$|E
30|$|The differing ecologies of the rufipogon {{perennial}} and nivara annual ecotypes of {{the wild}} rice imply differing modes of hunter-gatherer exploitation and the importance and intensity of early cultivation that was necessary (Fuller and Qin 2009). The perennial rufipogon would have normally been a fairly poor grain resource, with more metabolic energy invested in vegetative tissues. This necessitated human manipulation of soil and water environment to induce a drought response of higher grain productivity. Over time {{there would have been}} selection for more <b>annuality</b> and reduced vegetative growth (shorter and straighter growth habit), as well as increasing grain yields and grain size. Thus more intensive human efforts at managing the soil and water conditions of early cultivated rufipogon would have been repaid by increasing yields and the accumulation of domestication genes. The archaeological evidence from the Lower Yangtze supports this inferred process (Fuller and Qin 2009, 2010). By contrast, the annual O. nivara wild rices could have been exploited on a large scale without any serious cultivation, or selection of habit changes or domestication traits. This represents a “proto-indica” hypothesis (Fuller et al. 2010 a) in which intensive exploitation of proto-indica wild types, which probably included burning off competing vegetation and some broadcast sowing, could have taken place for millennia without the evolution of domesticated rice (Fuller 2011). In other words we would expect the adaptive syndrome of annual wild rice (Grillo et al. 2009) to have been reinforced through such proto-cultivation.|$|E
40|$|RONO: 00 Darnel (Lolium temulentum L.), {{the subject}} of this review, is botanically and {{culturally}} significant because of its evolutionary origin as a mimic weed of cereals and its reputation as a source of potent psychoactive toxins. Evidence from molecular phylogeny, palaeontology and archaeology allows the source and spread of darnel in time and space to be reconstructed. Contemporaneously with the progenitors of wheat and barley, at the dawn of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent region of Mesopotamia and the Eastern Mediterranean, darnel was derived from a perennial ancestor that was subject to the same human-mediated selection pressures as the earliest cereal species, and shares with them the domestication traits of <b>annuality,</b> self-fertility, high harvest index and non-shattering grains. Because it combines the characteristics of cereals with those of forage species of the Lolium-Festuca complex, L. temulentum is a useful experimental subject {{for the study of the}} physiology of temperate grasses. In particular, it has been a model for research on the control of flowering by day length, as well as investigations of vegetative development, resource allocation and responses to abiotic stresses. Recent studies of the chemical basis for darnel's noxious reputation reveal a complex picture in which endophytic fungi, nematodes and pathogenic bacteria separately or in combination account for the toxicity of the darnel grain. The relationship, and frequent historical conflation, of darnel and ergot poisoning is considered in detail. Finally, some examples of literary allusions to L. temulentum, from Aristophanes to Shakespeare, are given...|$|E
40|$|Evolved {{herbicide}} resistance (EHR) {{is an important}} agronomic problem and consequently a food security problem, as it jeopardizes herbicide effectiveness and increases the difficulty and cost of weed management. EHR in weeds was first reported in 1970 {{and the number of}} cases has accelerated dramatically over the last two decades. Despite 40 years of research on EHR, why some weeds evolve resistance and others do not is poorly understood. Here we ask whether weed species that have EHR are different from weeds in general. Comparing taxonomic and life history traits of weeds with EHR to a control group ("the world's worst weeds"), we found weeds with EHR significantly over-represented in certain plant families and having certain life history biases. In particular, resistance is overrepresented in Amaranthaceae, Brassicaceae and Poaceae relative to all weeds, and <b>annuality</b> is ca. 1. 5 times as frequent in weeds with EHR as in the control group. Also, for perennial EHR weeds, vegetative reproduction is only 60 % as frequent as in the control group. We found the same trends for subsets of weeds with EHR to acetolactate synthase (ALS), photosystem II (PSII), and 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate (EPSP) synthase-inhibitor herbicides and with multiple resistance. As herbicide resistant crops (transgenic or not) are increasingly deployed in developing countries, the problems of EHR could increase in those countries as it has in the USA if the selecting herbicides are heavily applied and appropriate management strategies are not employed.

40|$|For over {{a century}} and a half, public {{budgeting}} in Western industrialized countries has been predicted on a model that assumed a high level of resource mobilization for public purposes, strong public accountability, and bureaucratic control. This classical budget model, with its stress on <b>annuality,</b> unity, balance, and a regular budget cycle, replaced a pre-budgetary system based on continuity, decentralization, privatization, and flexibility. Although the pre-budgetary model had persisted for many hundreds of years, the introduction of budgeting was an enormous improvement. It emphasized public accountability against secrecy, democratic decision making against autocracy, regularity and control against opportunism and improvisation, and public norms against institutionalized corruption. Introduced as a tool for the financing and control of public agencies, the potential of the budget process was gradually recognized for other purposes, including planning, policy-making, and management. Yet even as the success of budgeting made it an unquestioned assumption of modern government, its own assumptions were under stress (Caiden, N. 1982). Whereas once it might have been imagined that public needs were finite and public resources infinite, the opposite now seemed more plausible: public demands were a bottomless pit and the revenues available to meet them were severely limited (Caiden, N. 1981). Moreover, while the budget cycle and its bureaucratic appendages were the accepted means for controlling government finances and maintaining public accountability, this linkage no longer appeared to be effective. By the 1980 s, not only did it seem that the promises of public budgeting remained unfulfilled, but it appeared that it was no longer even performing its basic functions effectively. In some respects, it almost seemed that things were going backward, to the bad old days of pre-budgeting.

40|$|Today, {{most studies}} of genetic {{variation}} utilise molecular markers, {{making it possible}} to detect variation at the DNA level. This has greatly facilitated studies of genetic variation in population and evolutionary genetics, systematics and transmission genetics. By studying the inheritance of molecular markers in crosses, it is possible to map the markers, i. e. to determine their genomic positions. Utilising mapped markers can make studies of genetic variation much more efficient. The present thesis explores several different applications of molecular markers requiring that the genomic positions be known, using beet (Beta vulgaris) as a model. Marker maps are often the basis for mapping genes of interest. Gene mapping studies usually focus on qualitative variation in traits determined by a single gene. Such genes are fairly easy to map in crosses segregating for the trait, although the resolution for the map position may be poor unless very large samples are studied. One method to increase the resolution is to use linkage disequilibrium mapping, which has been successfully employed in mapping several human disease genes. I have explored the possibility of using this method in plants as well, taking the gene for <b>annuality</b> in beets as an example. Mapping the genes responsible for variation in quantitative traits is much more complicated, since the genotypes in the genes cannot be observed directly. An example of the mapping of a quantitative trait, namely Cercospora resistance in beet, is included in the thesis. Utilising a high-density AFLP map, five genes were detected and mapped. Two different topics in population genetics that require mapped markers are presented. First, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium in both wild and cultivated beets is investigated. It is shown that linkage disequilibrium is only present between markers that are tightly linked. This result has important implications for an understanding both of the genetics underlying evolution and of how to conduct linkage disequilibrium mapping in beets. Secondly, I have studied the relation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination in natural populations of sea beets. The neutral theory predicts that genomic regions of high and low recombination should be equally variable. Results of empirical investigations in Drosophila are not in line with this prediction. Several non-neutral explanations have been invoked. Our study {{is one of the first}} on this topic in any other organism than Drosophila. The results show that the same positive correlation between levels of genetic variation and of recombination as in Drosophila is found in beets...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary <b>annuality</b> as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The {{budgetary}} {{process has}} recently attracted {{far less attention}} than the Plan and with a few notable exceptions, students of politics have shown {{little interest in the}} budgetary process. In France the budget is still the preserve of a few experts in the Faculties of Law whose research, however, is chiefly concerned with the legal aspects of the process and pays little attention to its administrative and political implications. Some have also argued that with the development of a sophisticated planning machinery the budgetary process loses most of its previous importance as a process for the taking of crucial economic and political decisions. Although {{it is true that the}} existence of the Plan has far reaching and complex repercussions on the Government bugetary policy - some of which are mentioned in the thesis - it remains that in France the Plan is not a substitute for the budget. Indeed, from the point of view of the Government, the budget is still the main and in many cases the only channel for the enactment of policies both at the governmental and parliamentary levels. The Plan's objectives can be achieved only if the policies of the annual budgets are in accordance with them. Hence, when the budget is prepared and discussed participants are conscious that much is still at stake. The aim of the thesis is to describe the French budgetary process as it operates today: how economic and financial decisions are made in the framework of that process. Who intervenes, when and for what purposes? The budgetary process needs to be approached as an administrative and governmental decision making process rather than a purely legislative or accounting process. We do not neglect the latter aspects but we consider that, in France as in many other countries, budgeting is more concerned with the question of how to take the right economic and financial decisions than with the question as to whether public funds are spent according to appropriations. Hence, our approach differs from that of most French writers who start with the assumption - legally correct - that the budget is decided in Parliament and then conclude, comparing the IVth and the Vth Republics that Parliament has lese decision making power now than under the previous Republic. As a result, they neglect the administrative and governmental parts of the process and these are now, as in England, the crucial ones. We do not pretend to be in a position to unveil every decision in the administrative and governmental stages for this is largely an internal process. But, mainly because civil servants and parliamentarians have shown great understanding for our research, we hope to have been able to make some inway into it. In some cases we have had to rely on a limited amount of information and some iinterpretations may well appear as tentative, but as G. Devaux, a former Head of the Budget Division aad author of a revealing book on the French financial administration has remarked: "Je cours le risque d'être accusé d'interpréter l'histoire. Mais je crois que les erreurs historiques les plus lourdes sont commises par ceux qui se dérobent a toute tentative d'interprétation". Budgeting is a traditional function of the State. It has given rise to well entrenched rules and habits. The progressive evolution and transformation of the budgetary process as well ae the impact of the reforms of the Vth Republic can only be understood in their historical context. Budgeting takes place within a legal and constitutional framework, for unlike planning, the budgetary process is by tradition a formal process. For example, decisions must be taken within precise constitutional time limits and must be expressed by way of well defined words and figures. These rules are known to civil servants, parliamentarians, interest groups, etc. and their skillful use may put some participants in a better position to influence decisions. Moreover, some of these rules (<b>annuality,</b> equilibrium of the budget, etc.) are the object of much controversy and political discussion. Occasionally, we deal with some of these questions for they deepen an understanding not only of the budgetary process but also of French politics. The process itself consists in the annual exercise of drafting and voting the budget. It is therefore necessary to follow the budget through its various stages, from the first tentative projection to the final version as approved by Parliament, and to describe the nature and functions of the various bodies which intervene in the making of the budget, during its elaboration and vote. Many jurists and economists tend to forget that budgetary decisions are answers to central political questions -"who gets what and how". However, when the budget is prepared and discussed, participants in the process fight hard either to get the funds they need for the initiation and continuation of the policies they are interested in or, as in the case of the Ministry of Finance, to maintain their control over Government activities. To see how the process looks from the inside we have interviewed more than sixty participants in the budgetary process to discover their aims, attitudes and strategies - officers of spending ministries, staff of various Division in the Ministry of Finance (particularly in the Budget Division and cabinet of the Minister of Finance), officers of the Planning Commissariat, advisers in the offices of the Prime Minister and the President, parliamentary staff and parliamentarians. We have been allowed to consult files at the Division of the Budget, in the cabinet of the Minister of Finance, and even at the Elysée, as well as in the parliamentary committees. Some of this information is secret, but we have reproduced some confidential documents in the appendix. Finally, since bugeting is an annual process, there is something to be learned from a case study of one budget. The last chapter traces the administrative, governmental and parliamentary progress of the 1967 budget. It shows how the system works when a particular budget has to be prepared and voted aud illustrates several aspects of our earlier analysis. It also deals more fully with the parliamentary stage of the budgetary process. We hope therefore, for the first time in any language, to have shown how the French budgetary process actually works as an exercise in executive and administrative decision making, how the institutions of the Vth Republic really function in this central matter of Government and how it looks to those actively engaged in the process itself. </p...|$|E
