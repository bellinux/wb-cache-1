50|$|It is advantageous, in some cases, for {{a program}} to exhibit nondeterministic {{behavior}}.The behavior of a card shuffling program used {{in a game of}} blackjack, for example,should not be predictable by players — even if the source code of the program isvisible. The use of a pseudorandom number generator is often not sufficient to ensure thatplayers are unable to predict the outcome of a shuffle. A clever gambler might guess precisely the numbers the generator will choose and so determine the entire contents <b>of</b> the deck <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> time, allowing <b>him</b> to cheat; for example, the Software Security Group at Reliable Software Technologies was able to do this for an implementation of Texas Hold 'em Poker that is distributed by ASF Software, Inc, allowing them to consistently predict the outcome <b>of</b> hands <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> time. These problems can be avoided, in part, {{through the use of a}} cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator, but it is still necessaryfor an unpredictable random seed to be used to initialize the generator. For thispurpose a source of nondeterminism is required, such as that provided by a hardware random number generator.|$|R

Kovalainen finished 16th and Glock 17th, though a glut of penalties - including one for Glock who was deemed to have blocked Hispania's Sakon Yamamoto - meant that Kovalainen would start the race thirteenth on the grid. Elsewhere, Michael Schumacher narrowly missed the cut for the final session and qualified eleventh, his retroactive penalty meaning he would start the race in 21st; the German was unconcerned following weather forecasts that predicted rain. Nico Rosberg qualified twelfth, but a gearbox change <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> qualifying netted <b>him</b> a five-place grid penalty of his own. Jaime Alguersuari and Vitantonio Liuzzi qualified thirteenth and fourteenth respectively, but would start the race from eleventh and twelfth by virtue of the Mercedes penalties. Alguersuari's Scuderia Toro Rosso team-mate Sébastien Buemi finished the session 16th overall, but was issued a three-place penalty for blocking Rosberg, but penalties to Schumacher, Rosberg and Glock negated his and the Swiss driver started the race in 16th.|$|R
