5|$|Ants perform many {{ecological}} {{roles that}} are beneficial to humans, including {{the suppression of}} pest populations and <b>aeration</b> of the soil. The use of weaver ants in citrus cultivation in southern China {{is considered one of}} the oldest known applications of biological control. On the other hand, ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses.|$|E
5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and <b>aeration,</b> dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via <b>aeration,</b> thereby oxidising the rock's pyrite. Pyrite contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil <b>aeration,</b> enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 <b>aeration</b> pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
25|$|Surface aerators are {{commonly}} quoted {{as having an}} <b>aeration</b> efficiency of 0.5 - 1.5kg O2/kWh, diffused <b>aeration</b> as 1.5 - 2.5kg O2/KWh. Deep Shaft claims 5 – 8kg O2/kWh.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia (NH3) {{is highly}} toxic {{to fish and}} the level of ammonia {{discharged}} from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via <b>aeration</b> prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the <b>aeration.</b>|$|E

25|$|Pumice {{is mixed}} with soil to provide good <b>aeration</b> for the plants. It is also used for {{hydroponics}} as a soilless growing medium.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation of FeII compounds, e.g. the {{precipitation}} of iron(II) salts as hydroxides {{followed by}} oxidation by <b>aeration</b> where careful control of the pH determines the oxide produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{activated}} sludge {{process is a}} type of wastewater treatment process for treating sewage or industrial wastewaters using <b>aeration</b> and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa.|$|E
25|$|Package {{plants are}} {{commonly}} variants of extended <b>aeration,</b> {{to promote the}} 'fit & forget' approach required for small communities without dedicated operational staff. There are various standards to assist with their design.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} {{secondary treatment}} processes, {{most of the}} electricity is used for <b>aeration,</b> pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of sewage sludge. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment.|$|E
25|$|Water {{movement}} {{can also}} be important in simulating a natural ecosystem. Aquarists may prefer anything from still water up to swift , depending on the aquarium's inhabitants. Water movement can be controlled via <b>aeration</b> from air pumps, powerheads, and careful design of internal water flow (such as location of filtration system points of inflow and outflow).|$|E
25|$|Aquaria {{became more}} widely popular as houses had an {{electricity}} supply after World War I. Electricity allowed artificial lighting, {{as well as}} <b>aeration,</b> filtration, and heating of the water. Initially, amateur aquarists kept native fish (with the exception of goldfish); the availability of exotic species from overseas further increased {{the popularity of the}} aquarium. Jugs made from a variety of materials were used to import fish from overseas, with a bicycle foot pump for <b>aeration.</b> Plastic shipping bags were introduced in the 1950s, making it easier to ship fish. The eventual availability of air freight allowed fish to be successfully imported from distant regions. In the 1960s, metal frames made marine aquaria almost impossible due to corrosion, but the development of tar and silicone sealant allowed the first all-glass aquaria made by Martin Horowitz in Los Angeles, CA. The frames remained, however, though purely for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|Crevice {{corrosion}} is a localized form of corrosion {{occurring in}} confined spaces (crevices), {{to which the}} access of the working fluid from the environment is limited. Formation of a differential <b>aeration</b> cell leads to corrosion inside the crevices. Examples of crevices are gaps and contact areas between parts, under gaskets or seals, inside cracks and seams, spaces filled with deposits and under sludge piles.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen {{exchange}} at {{the surface}} is an important constraint, and thus the surface area of the aquarium matters. Some aquarists claim that a deeper aquarium holds no more fish than a shallower aquarium with the same surface area. The capacity can be improved by surface movement and water circulation such as through <b>aeration,</b> which not only improves oxygen exchange, but also waste decomposition rates.|$|E
25|$|Bins need holes or mesh for <b>aeration.</b> Some people add a spout or {{holes in}} the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection. The most common {{materials}} used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood. Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay {{and need to be}} replaced.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of wastewater and biological mass is {{commonly known as}} mixed liquor. In all activated sludge plants, once the wastewater has received sufficient treatment, excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatant is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge. Part of the settled material, the sludge, is returned {{to the head of the}} <b>aeration</b> system to re-seed the new wastewater entering the tank. This fraction of the floc is called return activated sludge (R.A.S.).|$|E
25|$|A new {{development}} of the activated sludge process is the Nereda process which produces a granular sludge that settles very well (the sludge volume index is reduced from 200-300 to 40 mL/g). A new process reactor system is created {{to take advantage of}} this quick settling sludge and is integrated into the <b>aeration</b> tank instead of having a separate unit outside. About 30 Nereda wastewater treatment plants worldwide are operational, under construction or under design, varying in size from 5,000 up to 858,000 person equivalent.|$|E
25|$|For {{conventional}} {{sewage treatment}} plants, around 30 {{percent of the}} annual operating costs is usually required for energy. The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, constructed wetlands have a lower energy requirement than activated sludge plants, as less energy {{is required for the}} <b>aeration</b> step. Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their sewage sludge treatment process with anaerobic digestion can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.|$|E
25|$|The flavour {{of the tea}} {{can also}} be altered by pouring it from {{different}} heights, resulting in varying degrees of <b>aeration.</b> The art of elevated pouring is used principally by people in Northern Africa (e.g. Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Libya and Western Sahara), but also in West Africa (e.g. Guinea, Mali, Senegal) and can positively alter the flavour of the tea, {{but it is more}} likely a technique to cool the beverage destined to be consumed immediately. In certain cultures, the tea is given different names depending on the height from which it is poured.|$|E
25|$|Bournville Lane Baths were {{unusual in}} that they {{featured}} an <b>aeration</b> and filtration system for the water which was extracted from a mains supply. This meant that the baths {{did not need to}} be emptied and refilled. This system was modern and the system was later installed in all swimming baths controlled by local authorities meaning that King's Norton and Northfield District Council were the first local authority in the country to use such a system. The Baths were built in 1910 to a design by John P. Osborne. The building is Grade II listed.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{where more}} land is available, sewage is treated in large round or oval ditches {{with one or}} more {{horizontal}} aerators typically called brush or disc aerators which drive the mixed liquor around the ditch and provide <b>aeration.</b> These are oxidation ditches, often referred to by manufacturer's trade names such as Pasveer, Orbal, or Carrousel. They have the advantage that they are relatively easy to maintain and are resilient to shock loads that often occur in smaller communities (i.e. at breakfast time and in the evening).|$|E
25|$|Sewage liquor is {{run into}} deep tanks with {{diffuser}} grid <b>aeration</b> {{systems that are}} attached to the floor. These are like the diffused airstone used in tropical fish tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the open equilibrium scenario above, many swimming pools are managed by addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to about 2 mM as a buffer, then control of pH through use of HCl, NaHSO4, Na2CO3, NaOH or chlorine formulations that are acidic or basic. In this situation, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is far from equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Progress towards equilibrium through outgassing of CO2 is slowed by (i) the slow reaction H2CO3 ⇌ CO2(aq) + H2O; (ii) limited <b>aeration</b> in a deep water column and (iii) periodic replenishment of bicarbonate to maintain buffer capacity (often estimated through measurement of ‘total alkalinity’).|$|E
25|$|Activated sludge is {{a common}} suspended-growth method of {{secondary}} treatment. Activated sludge plants encompass a variety of mechanisms and processes using dissolved oxygen to promote growth of biological floc that substantially removes organic material. Biological floc is an ecosystem of living biota subsisting on nutrients from the inflowing primary clarifier effluent. These mostly carbonaceous dissolved solids undergo <b>aeration</b> to be broken down and either biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide or converted to additional biological floc of reproducing micro-organisms. Nitrogenous dissolved solids (amino acids, ammonia, etc.) are similarly converted to biological floc or oxidized by the floc to nitrites, nitrates, and, in some processes, to nitrogen gas through denitrification. While denitrification is encouraged in some treatment processes, denitrification often impairs the settling of the floc causing poor quality effluent in many suspended <b>aeration</b> plants. Overflow from the activated sludge mixing chamber is sent to a secondary clarifier where the suspended biological floc settles out while the treated water moves into tertiary treatment or disinfection. Settled floc is returned to the mixing basin to continue growing in primary effluent. Like most ecosystems, population changes among activated sludge biota can reduce treatment efficiency. Nocardia, a floating brown foam sometimes misidentified as sewage fungus, is {{the best known of}} many different fungi and protists that can overpopulate the floc and cause process upsets. Elevated concentrations of toxic wastes including pesticides, industrial metal plating waste, or extreme pH, can kill the biota of an activated sludge reactor ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Pure oxygen {{activated}} sludge <b>aeration</b> systems are sealed-tank reactor vessels with surface aerator type impellers mounted within the tanks at the oxygen atmosphere-mixed liquor surface interface. The amount of oxygen entrainment, or DO (Dissolved Oxygen), {{can be controlled}} by a weir adjusted level control, and a vent gas oxygen controlled oxygen feed valve. Oxygen is generated on site by cryogenic distillation of air, pressure swing adsorption, or other methods. These systems are used where wastewater plant space is at a premium and high sewage throughput is required as high energy costs are involved in purifying oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} time a wine spends in the barrel is {{dependent}} on the varietal and finished style the winemaker desires. The majority of oak flavoring is imparted in the first few months the wine is in contact with oak, while longer term exposure adds light barrel <b>aeration,</b> which helps precipitate phenolic compounds and quickens the aging process. New World Pinot noir may spend less than a year in oak. Premium Cabernet Sauvignon may spend two years. The very tannic Nebbiolo grape may spend four or more years in oak. High end Rioja producers will sometimes age their wines up to ten years in American oak to get a desired earthy cedar and herbal character.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and soil <b>aeration</b> due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with <b>aeration.</b> A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the drip course of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the quicklime, which reacted violently to water.|$|E
25|$|The process uses a {{salt bath}} of alkali cyanate. This is {{contained}} in a steel pot that has an <b>aeration</b> system. The cyanate thermally reacts with {{the surface of the}} workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of vascular plant roots within soil depends on plant form, the {{spatial and temporal}} availability of water and nutrients, and the physical properties of the soil. The deepest roots are generally found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands. The deepest observed living root, at least 60 metres below the ground surface, was observed during the excavation of an open-pit mine in Arizona, USA. Some roots can grow as deep as the tree is high. The majority of roots on most plants are however found relatively {{close to the surface}} where nutrient availability and <b>aeration</b> are more favourable for growth. Rooting depth may be physically restricted by rock or compacted soil close below the surface, or by anaerobic soil conditions.|$|E
25|$|Aerial roots: roots entirely {{above the}} ground, {{such as in}} ivy (Hedera) or in epiphytic orchids. Many aerial roots, are used to receive water and {{nutrient}} intake directly from the air - from fogs, dew or humidity in the air. Some rely on leaf systems to gather rain or humidity and even store it in scales or pockets. Other aerial roots, such as mangrove aerial roots, are used for <b>aeration</b> and not for water absorption. Other aerial roots are used mainly for structure, functioning as prop roots, as in maize or anchor roots or as the trunk in strangler fig. In some Epiphytes - plants living above the surface on other plants, aerial roots serve for reaching to water sources or reaching the surface, and then functioning as regular surface roots.|$|E
25|$|Avocados can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking roughly four to {{six years}} to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing. The offspring {{is unlikely to be}} identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil <b>aeration</b> or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.|$|E
