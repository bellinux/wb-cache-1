This engine was unsuitable for regular passenger car use, mainly due to its relatively small displacement and power output.|$|R
50|$|Some IFVs are amphibious and <b>air</b> <b>transportable.</b> A few, {{such as the}} Soviet BMD series or the Chinese ZBD2000, can be {{deployed}} by a parachute system from aircraft directly into battle. Because of their usually lighter weight compared to main battle tanks, IFVs can be transported by {{a wider variety of}} cargo aircraft, and they can cross bridges that heavier vehicles could not.|$|R
