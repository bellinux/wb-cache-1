25|$|Example: Suppose we {{have six}} schools with populations of 150, 180, 200, 220, 260, and490 {{students}} respectively (total 1500 students), <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to use student population {{as the basis}} for a PPS sample of size three.

We then generate a random start between 1 and 500 (equal to1500/3) and count through the school populations by multiples of 500. If our random start was 137, we would select the schools which have been allocated numbers 137, 637, and1137, i.e. the first, fourth, and sixth schools.|$|E

500|$|Fearing that {{introducing}} the character as an [...] " [...] to the boys" [...] would hinder {{their chances of}} successfully integrating her into the series, the writers intended that Ruby should be [...] "a character in [...] own right" [...] and deemed her an antagonist [...] "with [...] own interests and [...] own motives" [...] rather than a love interest to Sam or Dean, which they felt had been their mistake in their introduction of the widely disliked Jo Harvelle in the second season. While they were not planning on a romance between Ruby and either of the Winchesters in the third season, however, they were open to the possibility in the future, with Kripke saying, [...] "If the chemistry is there, {{and we see the}} sparks, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it to happen, and the fans want it to happen, it'll happen." [...] Due to [...] "protective and occasionally nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant to introduce Ruby in [...] "small doses".

500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what I think is going to sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|Along with coaching, Harry Sinden {{was given}} the task of {{selecting}} Team Canada, {{which would be the}} first true [...] "team" [...] composed of NHL all-stars. When Sinden announced the list of 35 Canadian players on July 12, one of the conditions of playing was revealed; that players would have to have a signed NHL contract by August 13. His list of players included Bobby Hull, who by that time had already signed with the rival World Hockey Association (WHA) league. Three other players Sinden named: Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and J. C. Tremblay had not yet signed with the WHA, but would do so and become ineligible. The condition had been negotiated between the NHL and Hockey Canada, and the NHL would not relent. The condition was widely criticized, including by the NHL's own Harold Ballard, the Toronto Maple Leafs owner and a harsh opponent of the WHA. Ballard felt that the series was the [...] "unofficial world series of hockey <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to win". Phil Reimer, a governor of Hockey Canada, resigned over the matter. Prime Minister Trudeau made a personal appeal, but Doug Fisher, chairman of Hockey Canada refused to re-open the agreement between the NHL and Hockey Canada.|$|E
500|$|On May 3, 2013, just a {{month before}} the film's premiere, {{producers}} announced that Al Pacino had left the film over creative differences about how his character should come to life. At the time of his departure, Pacino's character had already been fully voiced and animated. Chris Renaud, co-director of the film, commented on Pacino's departure: [...] "So we don't want an unhappy actor, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> something that is well-realized on all sides. If you don't see eye to eye, sometimes it's easier to (part company) and move on from there." [...] Benjamin Bratt, who had already been considered before Pacino, stepped in to voice Eduardo. Chris Meledandri, producer of the film, admitted that he was not [...] "aware of any of the major animated films of the last 15 years that has brought an actor in at such a late stage". Due to the finished animation, Bratt had to match his timing exactly to the character's mouth movement. Initially, during his five-day recording, he tried to imitate Pacino's voice, but found it impossible, saying [...] "no one can out-Al Pacino Al Pacino". He ended up only using Pacino as an inspiration, and resolved to go with his own interpretation of the character. His work was commended by Variety, saying: [...] "You'd never guess he wasn't the filmmakers' first choice." ...|$|E
