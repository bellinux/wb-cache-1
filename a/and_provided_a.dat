This link was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time.|$|E

US-59 was changed to follow the present-day route in 1951.

The following month, the Indian Army undertook several operations in the north-west of Naushahra to stop further advances by the Pakistani forces.

Soldiers were deployed in small groups on possible enemy approaches.|$|E
5|$|Deir al-Balah was {{captured}} by the British Army following the surrender of Khan Yunis on 28 February 1917. By April an aerodrome and an army camp were established there and Deir al-Balah became a launching point for British forces against Ottoman-held Gaza and Beersheba {{to the north and}} northeast, respectively. Of the 25 British war cemeteries dating from World War I, one of the six largest was built in Deir al-Balah in March 1917. It continued to be used until March 1918 and contains a total of 724 graves. Deir al-Balah became a part of the British Mandate of Palestine starting in 1922. A municipal council to administer the town was established by the British authorities in 1946, but it had limited jurisdiction over civil affairs <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> few basic services.|$|E

The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs.

Hemmemas fought in the first and second battles of Svensksund.

5|$|However, once {{he learned}} that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his {{relationship}} to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to Amélie of Leuchtenberg. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lorenzo quickly {{developed}} a closed eyewall, which was observed on radar <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>a</b> peak intensity estimate of 80mph (130km/h) at 0000UTC on September28. The cyclone maintained vigorous and symmetric convection across the center, although the structure deteriorated slightly before Lorenzo crossed the coast near Tecolutla, Veracruz at 0500UTC that day, with winds estimated around 75mph (120km/h). After making landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical depression intensity. Progressing inland, the circulation became difficult to locate as the convection diminished to rainbands along the coast. Within 19hours after moving ashore, {{the circulation of}} Lorenzo dissipated, therefore ending its duration as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
