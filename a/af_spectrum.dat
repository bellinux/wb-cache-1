40|$|In {{patients}} with atrial fibrillation (AF), the fibrillatory frequency trend and the time-dependent spectral characteristics can be investigated using a spectral profile technique. The spectral profile is updated by fitting each short-time spectrum. The {{aim of this}} study is to develop model-based means for stricter control on the update of the spectral profile. A spectral model defined by a superposition of Gaussian functions is suggested for describing the fundamental and harmonics of the atrial waves during AF, thereby accounting for basic characteristics of the typical <b>AF</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The model parameters are obtained from weighted least squares fitting of the model to the observed spectrum. The method was tested on simulated signals as well as on 48 ECG recordings from 15 {{patients with}} persistent AF. Using simulated signals, we assessed the accuracy in terms of magnitude and width or the spectral peaks. For SNR = 0 dB, the maximum normalized error was less than 0. 2 when estimating magnitude of both the fundamental and the harmonics, whereas it was less than 0. 15 for the fundamental and 0. 7 for the harmonics with respect to the estimation of the width. We observed a marked Improvement while tracking the main fibrillatory frequency as the error was reduced by more than 50 % In comparison with the original method. Analyzing ECGs, reliable spectral profiles were obtained In all recordings, even In those cases (5 / 48) that were not well characterized by the original method...|$|E

Interestingly, unusual NRM directions were found at several depths by stepwise AF demagnetizations, manifested by significantly large departures {{from the direction of}} today’s axial dipole field. On the other hand, stepwise TH demagnetizations show more complex behavior resulting in the identification of multiple directional components, where two distinct components with TH steps between 120 and 240 – 320  °C (LTC 1), and between 240 – 320 and 520 – 580  °C (HTC 1), respectively, are predominant in all specimens analyzed. The low-temperature components (LTC 1  s) generally indicate normal-polarity directions presumably within the secular variation range in the normal Brunhes Chron, whereas the high-temperature components (HTC 1  s) often have unusual directions including negative inclinations and reversed directions, particularly in the[*]~[*] 13 – 34 cmcd (~[*] 17.6 – 18.8  ka in inferred age) and possibly below[*]~[*] 53  cmcd (before[*]~[*] 20.2  ka).

Some differences in directional behavior between AF and TH demagnetizations could be interpreted to result from incomplete separation, by the AF demagnetization, of the two remanence components with strongly overlapping <b>AF</b> <b>spectra</b> each other.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) are strongly {{dependent on the}} internal stress related to stress-controlled regions and to closure domains associated with defects. The contribution of internal stress to the low-temperature {{magnetic properties}} of magnetite was tested using annealed and unannealed multi-domain (MD) magnetites. During low-temperature cooling, a room temperature-induced saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) increased abruptly at the Verwey transition (Tv 122 K). In particular, the absolute intensity jump (?VJ, defined as the jump in SIRM at Tv upon cooling) resulted from the high-coercivity fraction of MD grains. We observe that annealing significantly reduces internal stress and thus decreases the average microcoercivity. Comparison of the alternating field (<b>AF)</b> demagnetization <b>spectra</b> of ?VJ both for annealed and unannealed magnetites directly links ?VJ to the internal stress. It is likely that removal of the closure domain associated with stress-controlled regions was dominant when the peak AF was less than the average micromagnetic coercivity hc, resulting in a net increase of ?VJ with increasing AF. However, when the AF exceeded the hc threshold, ?VJ decreased because the stress-controlled regions were demagnetized. Such observations could therefore be useful for estimating the hc of MD magnetite. <br/...|$|R

It would be beneficial to have a noninvasive multimodal optical device for diagnosing early stage caries in vivo. In this research, the author develops and proposes an optical device which utilizes multiple modalities to screen for, and diagnose early stage dental caries. A clinical prototype device is developed and tested in a clinical setting to verify its suitability for in vivo use. To develop a screening technique {{that can be used to}} alert the clinician to an area of suspected caries, an ultrathin scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) was used. Enhanced image resolution of tooth surfaces was obtained using a short-wavelength 405 nm illumination laser using the SFE. In addition, enamel with demineralization of varying depths were also imaged with 405 nm, 444 nm, 532 nm, and 635 nm illumination lasers. Contrast between sound and demineralized enamel was quantitatively computed for each imaging modality. For shallow demineralization, the image contrast with respect to sound enamel was greatest for the 405 nm reflected image. Furthermore, images obtained with a shallow penetration depth illumination laser (405 nm) provided the greatest detail of surface enamel topography since the reflected light does not contain contributions from light reflected from greater depths within the enamel tissue. Multilayered Monte Carlo simulations were also performed to confirm the experimental results. To quantitatively determine health of the tooth enamel, the author developed a simple and robust autofluorescence (AF) technique that uses the dental <b>AF</b> <b>spectra</b> from 405 nm and 532 nm laser excitation and computes a ratio of the integrated areas of the spectra. The 405 / 532 nm AF ratio was obtained from healthy as well as unhealthy enamel regions of teeth. A clear distinction between the ratios for healthy enamel and unhealthy enamel was seen. The author has developed a multimodal optical clinical prototype by combining the high contrast and high surface resolution SFE imaging modality with the quantitative AF modality. The device can be used to quickly image and screen for any signs of demineralized enamel by obtaining high-resolution and high-contrast surface images using a 405 -nm laser as the illumination source, as well as obtaining autofluorescence and bacterial fluorescence images. When a suspicious region of demineralization is located, the device also performs dual laser fluorescence spectroscopy using 405 -nm and 532 -nm laser excitation. An autofluorescence ratio of the two excitation lasers is computed and used to quantitatively diagnose enamel health. The device was tested on in vivo patients as well as extracted teeth with clinically diagnosed carious lesions. The device was able to provide detailed images which highlighted the lesions identified by the clinicians.

In the D/AR switching, switching between direct communication and cooperative AF relay is done so that the channel capacity is maximized. In the SDASA, the transmit SC signal spectrum is divided into sub-blocks, to each of which {{a different set of}} subcarriers (resource block) is adaptively allocated. We evaluate the achievable channel capacity by the Monte-Carlo numerical computation method. It is shown that the proposed D/AR switching can reduce the transmit power by about 4 (2) dB compared to the direct communication (the cooperative AF relay) for the 1 %- outage capacity of 4. 0 bps/Hz.

The ferromagnetic spin-wave has a small temperature independent gap of 0. 25 meV and a reduced (compared to other rare-earth Fe 2 Laves phases) stiffness constant of D = 155 (5) me V-A 2. The strong fluctuations around the AF wavevector give rise to a spin wave dispersion relationship that can be followed across the reduced AF Brillouin zone. The gap in the <b>AF</b> excitation <b>spectrum</b> is ~ 1 me V at 15 K, and rises to ~ 5 meV above 100 K. At low temperature with a window of +- 20 GHz observe an apparent static component of ~ 0. 05 muB superimposed on the ferromagnetic component of 1. 2 muB per Fe. The spatial correlations of these AF fluctuations extends over many unit cells at low temperature. Our measurements have not detected any response directly from the Ce moments, so we assume that their response is spread over a wide energy range. Mossbauer spectra show an anomalous behavior of the Lamb-Mossbauer factor as a function of temperature, and also show that the magnetic system is not saturated even at a large (5 T) fields, suggesting that short-range AF order may persist to higher temperatures than the medium-range order observed in the neutron experiments.

40|$|Introduction Intravenous {{ibutilide}} is used {{to convert}} atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR) due to its Class III antiarrhythmic mechanisms. However, the effects of ibutilide on local electrograms (EGMs) during AF have not been elucidated. Methods and Results We used EGM analysis techniques to characterize how ibutilide administration changes the frequency, morphology, and repeatability of AF EGM signals, thereby providing insight into ibutilide's antiarrhythmic mechanism of action. AF recordings were collected from 21 patients with AF, {{both before and after}} ibutilide administration. The effects of ibutilide on the following AF EGM parameters were assessed: (1) dominant frequency (DF), (2) variations in EGM amplitude and overall morphology, (3) repetition of EGM patterns, and (4) complexity of the <b>AF</b> frequency <b>spectra.</b> When comparing pre- versus post-ibutilide administration EGMs, DF decreased from 5. 45 Hz to 4. 02 Hz (P < 0. 0001). There was an increase in the variability of both AF EGM amplitudes (P = 0. 003) and overall AF EGM morphologies (P = 0. 003). AF EGM pattern repetitiveness decreased (P = 0. 01), and the AF frequency spectral profile manifested greater complexity (P = 0. 02). Conclusions Novel EGM signal analysis techniques reveal that ibutilide administration causes increased complexity in the atrial electrical activation pattern with decreasing rate. These findings may be explained by the progressive destabilization of higher frequency, more homogeneous primary drivers of AF over the course of ibutilide administration, and/or less uniform propagation of atrial activation, until AF maintenance becomes more difficult and either transforms to atrial tachycardia or terminates to SR...|$|R

In this study, patients with dissociated left and right atrial rhythms were studied {{in order to identify}} which surface electrocardiographic (ECG) leads that most closely reflect the left atrial activity. Methods: Two consecutive patients with atrial tachycardia confined to the left atrial appendage (LAA) detected during catheter ablation of AF were included (2 men, 54 and 72 years old). A 12 -lead ECG was recorded simultaneously with electrograms from the right and left atrial appendages (RAA/LAA). <b>AF</b> frequency <b>spectra</b> were calculated from all 12 leads using spatiotemporal QRST cancellation and Welch periodogram.

We have measured their radial velocities by cross-correlation of high resolution (R~ 6000) <b>AF</b> 2 /WYFFOS <b>spectra</b> of the gravity sensitive NaI doublet at 8183, 8195 Angstroms. The total sample contained 117 objects of which 54 have sufficient signal-to-noise to detect NaI at an equivalent width of 3 Angstroms, however we only detect NaI in 38 of these. This implies that very low-mass members of this young group display weaker NaI absorption than similarly aged objects in the Upper Scorpius OB association. We develop a technique to assess membership using radial velocities {{with a range of}} uncertainties that does not bias the selection when large uncertainties are present. The resulting membership probabilities are used to assess the issue of exclusion in photometric selections, and we find that very few members are likely to be excluded by such techniques. We also assess the level of contamination in the expected pre-main sequence region of colour-magnitude space brighter than I = 17. We find that contamination by non-members in the expected PMS region of the colour-magnitude diagram is small. We conclude that although radial velocity alone is insufficient to confirm membership, high signal-to-noise observations of the NaI doublet provide the opportunity to use the strength of NaI absorption in concert with radial velocities to asses membership down to the lowest masses, where Lithium absorption no longer distinguishes youth.

40|$|An {{important}} parameter for {{the characterization}} of strong ground motion at high-frequencies (> 1 Hz) is kappa, κ, which models a linear decay of the acceleration <b>spectrum,</b> <b>a(f),</b> in log-linear space (i. e. a(f) = A 0 exp(- π kf) for f>f E where f is frequency, f E is a low frequency limit and A 0 controls the amplitude of the spectrum). κ is a key input parameter in the stochastic method for the simulation of strong ground motion, which is particularly useful for areas with insufficient strong-motion data to enable the derivation of robust empirical ground motion prediction equations, such as mainland France. Numerous studies using strong-motion data from western North America (WNA) (an active tectonic region where surface rock is predominantly soft) and eastern North America (ENA) (a stable continental region where surface rock is predominantly very hard) have demonstrated that κ varies with region and surface geology, with WNA rock sites having a κ of about 0. 04 s and ENA rock sites having a κ of about 0. 006 s. Lower κs are one reason why high-frequency strong ground motions in stable regions are generally higher than in active regions for the same magnitude and distance. Few, if any, estimates of κs for French sites have been published. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study is to estimate κ using data recorded by the French national strong-motion network (RAP) for various sites in different regions of mainland France. For each record, a value of κ is estimated by following the procedure developed by Anderson and Hough (Bull Seismol Soc Am 74 : 1969 - 1993, 1984) : this method is based on the analysis of the S-wave spectrum, which has to be performed manually, thus leading to some uncertainties. For the three French regions where most records are available (the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Côtes-d'Azur), a regional κ model is developed using weighted regression on the local geology (soil or rock) and source-to-site distance. It is found that the studied regions have a mean κ between the values found for WNA and ENA. For example, for the Alps region a κ value of 0. 0254 s is found for rock sites, an estimate reasonably consistent with previous studies...|$|R

Conclusions: Measurements made from all four spectral estimators were in agreement as to whether {{the means and standard deviations}} in three spectral parameters were greater in CFAEs acquired from paroxysmal or in persistent AF patients. Since the measurements were consistent, use of two or more of these estimators for power spectral analysis can be assistive to evaluate CFAE more objectively and accurately, which may lead to improved clinical outcome. Since the most significant differences overall were achieved using the NSE and NSH estimators, parameters measured from their spectra will likely be the most useful for detecting and discerning electrophysiologic differences in the AF substrate based upon frequency analysis of CFAE...|$|R
40|$|As the {{wireless}} communication technologies evolve {{and the demand}} of wireless services increases, spectrum scarcity becomes a bottleneck that limits {{the introduction of new}} technologies and services. Spectrum sharing between primary and secondary users has been brought up to improve spectrum efficiency. In underlay spectrum sharing, the secondary user transmits simultaneously with the primary user, under the constraint that the interference induced at the primary receiver is below a certain threshold, or a certain primary rate requirement has to be satisfied. Specifically, in this thesis, the coexistence of a multiple-input single-output (MISO) primary link and a MISO/multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secondary link is studied. The primary transmitter employs maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and single-user decoding is deployed at the primary receiver. Three scenarios are investigated, in terms of the interference from the primary transmitter to the secondary receiver, namely, weak interference, strong interference and very strong interference, or equivalently three ranges of primary rate requirement. Rate splitting and successive decoding are deployed at the secondary transmitter and receiver, respectively, when it is feasible, and otherwise single-user decoding is deployed at the secondary receiver. For each scenario, optimal beamforming/precoding and power allocation at the secondary transmitter is derived, to maximize the achievable secondary rate while satisfying the primary rate requirement and the secondary power constraint. Numerical results show that rate splitting at the secondary transmitter and successive decoding at the secondary receiver does significantly increase the achievable secondary rate if feasible, compared with single-user decoding at the secondary receiver. In overlay spectrum sharing, different from underlay spectrum sharing, the secondary transmitter can utilize the knowledge of the primary message, which is acquired non-causally (i. e., known in advance before transmission) or causally (i. e., acquired in the first phase of a two-phase transmission), to help transmit the primary message besides its own message. Specifically, the coexistence of a MISO primary link and a MISO/MIMO secondary link is studied. When the secondary transmitter has non-causal knowledge of the primary message, dirty-paper coding (DPC) can be deployed at the secondary transmitter to precancel the interference (when decoding the secondary message at the secondary receiver), due to the transmission of the primary message from both transmitters. Alternatively, due to the high implementation complexity of DPC, linear precoding can be deployed at the secondary transmitter. In both cases, the primary transmitter employs MRT, and single-user decoding is deployed at the primary receiver; optimal beamforming/precoding and power allocation at the secondary transmitter is obtained, to maximize the achievable secondary rate while satisfying the primary rate requirement and the secondary power constraint. Numerical results show that with non-causal knowledge of the primary message and the deployment of DPC at the secondary transmitter, overlay spectrum sharing can achieve a significantly higher secondary rate than underlay spectrum sharing, while rate loss occurs with the deployment of linear precoding instead of DPC at the secondary transmitter. When the secondary transmitter does not have non-causal knowledge of the primary message, and still wants to help with the primary transmission in return for the access to the spectrum, it can relay the primary message in an amplify-and-forward (AF) or a decode-and-forward (DF) way in a two-phase transmission, while transmitting its own message. The primary link adapts its transmission strategy and cooperates with the secondary link to fulfill its rate requirement. To maximize the achievable secondary rate while satisfying the primary rate requirement and the primary and secondary power constraints, in the case of <b>AF</b> cooperative <b>spectrum</b> sharing, optimal relaying matrix and beamforming vector at the secondary transmitter is obtained; in the case of DF cooperative spectrum sharing, a set of parameters are optimized, including time duration of the two phases, primary transmission strategies in the two phases and secondary transmission strategy in the second phase. Numerical results show that with the cooperation from the secondary link, the primary link can avoid outage effectively, especially when the number of antennas at the secondary transceiver is large, while the secondary link can achieve a significant rate. Power is another precious resource besides spectrum. Instead of spectrum efficiency, energy-efficient spectrum sharing focuses on the energy efficiency (EE) optimization of the secondary transmission. The EE of the secondary transmission is defined as the ratio of the achievable secondary rate and the secondary power consumption, which includes both the transmit power and the circuit power at the secondary transmitter. For simplicity, the circuit power is modeled as a constant. Specifically, the EE of a MIMO secondary link in underlay spectrum sharing is studied. Three transmission strategies are introduced based on the primary rate requirement and the channel conditions. Rate splitting and successive decoding are deployed at the secondary transmitter and receiver, respectively, when it is feasible, and otherwise single-user decoding is deployed at the secondary receiver. For each case, optimal transmit covariance matrices at the secondary transmitter are obtained, to maximize the EE of the secondary transmission while satisfying the primary rate requirement and the secondary power constraint. Based on this, an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that MIMO underlay spectrum sharing with EE optimization can achieve a significantly higher EE compared with MIMO underlay spectrum sharing with rate optimization, at certain SNRs and with certain circuit power, at the cost of the achievable secondary rate, while saving the transmit power. With rate splitting at the secondary transmitter and successive decoding at the secondary receiver if feasible, a significantly higher EE can be achieved compared with the case when only single-user decoding is deployed at the secondary receiver. Moreover, the EE of a MIMO secondary link in overlay spectrum sharing is studied, where the secondary transmitter has non-causal knowledge of the primary message and employs DPC to obtain an interference-free secondary link. Energy-efficient precoding and power allocation is obtained to maximize the EE of the secondary transmission while satisfying the primary rate requirement and the secondary power constraint. Numerical results show that MIMO overlay spectrum sharing with EE optimization can achieve a significantly higher EE compared with MIMO overlay spectrum sharing with rate optimization, at certain SNRs and with certain circuit power, at the cost of the achievable secondary rate, while saving the transmit power. MIMO overlay spectrum sharing with EE optimization can achieve a higher EE compared with MIMO underlay spectrum sharing with EE optimization. Aufgrund der rasanten Entwicklung im Bereich der drahtlosen Kommunikation und der ständig steigenden Nachfrage nach mobilen Anwendungen ist die Knappheit von Frequenzbändern ein entscheidender Engpass, der die Einführung neuer Funktechnologien behindert. Die gemeinsame Benutzung von Frequenzen (Spektrum-Sharing) durch primäre und sekundäre Nutzer ist eine Möglichkeit, die Effizienz bei der Verwendung des Spektrums zu verbessern. Bei der Methode des Underlay-Spektrum-Sharing sendet der sekundäre Nutzer zeitgleich mit dem primären Nutzer unter der Einschränkung, dass für den primären Nutzer die erzeugte Interferenz unterhalb eines Schwellwertes liegt oder gewisse Anforderungen an die Datenrate erfüllt werden. In diesem Zusammenhang wird in der Arbeit insbesondere die Koexistenz von Mehrantennensystemen untersucht. Dabei wird für die primäre Funkverbindung der Fall mit mehreren Sendeantennen und einer Empfangsantenne (MISO) angenommen. Für die sekundäre Funkverbindung werden mehrere Sendeantennen und sowohl eine als auch mehrere Empfangsantennen (MISO/MIMO) betrachtet. Der primäre Sender verwendet Maximum-Ratio-Transmission (MRT) und der primäre Empfänger Einzelnutzerdecodierung. Für den sekundären Nutzer werden außerdem am Sender eine Datenratenaufteilung (rate splitting) und am Empfänger entweder eine sukzessive Decodierung – sofern sinnvoll – oder andernfalls eine Einzelnutzerdecodierung verwendet. Im Unterschied zur Methode des Underlay-Spektrum-Sharing kann der sekundäre Nutzer beim Verfahren des Overlay-Spektrum-Sharing die Kenntnis über die Nachrichten des primären Nutzers einsetzen, um die Übertragung sowohl der eigenen als auch der primären Nachrichten zu unterstützen. Das Wissen über die Nachrichten erhält er entweder nicht-kausal, d. h. vor der Übertragung, oder kausal, d. h. während der ersten Phase einer zweistufigen Übertragung. In der Arbeit wird speziell die Koexistenz von primären MISO-Funkverbindungen und sekundären MISO/MIMO-Funkverbindungen untersucht. Bei nicht-kausaler Kenntnis über die primären Nachrichten kann der sekundäre Sender beispielsweise das Verfahren der Dirty-Paper-Codierung (DPC) verwenden, welches es ermöglicht, die Interferenz durch die primären Nachrichten bei der Decodierung der sekundären Nachrichten am sekundären Empfänger aufzuheben. Da die Implementierung der DPC mit einer hohen Komplexität verbunden ist, kommt als Alternative auch eine lineare Vorcodierung zum Einsatz. In beiden Fällen verwendet der primäre Transmitter MRT und der primäre Empfänger Einzelnutzerdecodierung. Besitzt der sekundäre Nutzer keine nicht-kausale Kenntnis über die primären Nachrichten, so kann er als Gegenleistung für die Mitbenutzung des Spektrums dennoch die Übertragung der primären Nachrichten unterstützen. Hierfür leitet er die primären Nachrichten mit Hilfe der Amplify-And-Forward-Methode oder der Decode-And-Forward-Methode in einer zweitstufigen Übertragung weiter, währenddessen er seine eigenen Nachrichten sendet. Der primäre Nutzer passt seine Sendestrategie entsprechend an und kooperiert mit dem sekundären Nutzer, um die Anforderungen an die Datenrate zu erfüllen. Nicht nur das Spektrum sondern auch die Sendeleistung ist eine wichtige Ressource. Daher wird zusätzlich zur Effizienz bei der Verwendung des Spektrums auch die Energieeffizienz (EE) einer sekundären MIMO-Funkverbindung für das Underlay-Spektrum-Sharing-Verfahren analysiert. Wie zuvor wird für den sekundären Nutzer am Sender eine Datenratenaufteilung (rate splitting) und am Empfänger entweder eine sukzessive Decodierung oder eine Einzelnutzerdecodierung betrachtet. Weiterhin wird die EE einer sekundären MIMO-Funkverbindung für das Overlay-Spektrum-Sharing-Verfahren untersucht. Dabei nutzt der sekundäre Nutzer die nicht-kausale Kenntnis über die primären Nachrichten aus, um mittels DPC eine interferenzfreie sekundäre Funkverbindung zu erhalten...|$|R
