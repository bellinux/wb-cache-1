25|$|Low-allergen {{foods are}} being developed, as are {{improvements}} in {{skin prick test}} predictions; evaluation of the <b>atopy</b> patch test; in wasp sting outcomes predictions and a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.|$|E
25|$|In {{children}} {{who are at risk}} for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having <b>atopy),</b> atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist.|$|E
25|$|The {{allergic}} diseases—hay {{fever and}} asthma—have {{increased in the}} Western world over the past 2–3 decades. Increases in allergic asthma and other atopic disorders in industrialized nations, it is estimated, began in the 1960s and 1970s, with further increases occurring during the 1980s and 1990s, although some suggest that a steady rise in sensitization has been occurring since the 1920s. The number of new cases per year of <b>atopy</b> in developing countries has, in general, remained much lower.|$|E
25|$|In {{people with}} predisposing lung diseases—such as {{persistent}} asthma or cystic fibrosis (or rarer {{diseases such as}} chronic granulomatous disease or Hyper-IgE syndrome)—several factors lead to {{an increased risk of}} ABPA. These include immune factors (such as <b>atopy</b> or immunogenic HLA-restricted phenotypes), as well as genetic factors (such as CFTR gene mutations in both asthmatics and cystic fibrosis patients). By allowing Aspergillus spores to persist in pulmonary tissues, it permits successful germination which leads to hyphae growing in mucus plugs.|$|E
25|$|In the past, some {{research}} suggested that geographic tongue {{was associated with}} diabetes, seborrheic dermatitis and <b>atopy,</b> however newer research does not corroborate these findings. Others suggest allergy as a major factor, e.g. to nickel sulphate. Some studies have reported a link between geographic tongue and psoriasis, although 90% {{of children who are}} diagnosed with geographic tongue do not develop psoriasis. Again however, modern research studies do not support any link between psoriasis and geographic tongue. Lesions that are histologically indistinguishable from geographic tongue may also be diagnosed in reactive arthritis (arthritis, uveitis/conjunctivitis and urethritis).|$|E
25|$|Food allergy is a non-seasonal {{disease with}} skin and/or {{gastrointestinal}} disorders. The main complaint is pruritus. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. There is no breed, sex or age predilection, although some breeds are commonly affected. Before {{the onset of}} clinical signs, the animals have been fed the offending food components {{for at least two}} years, although some animals are less than a year old. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases (<b>atopy</b> / flea-allergic dermatitis). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with an elimination diet. Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).|$|E
25|$|Changes {{in rates}} {{and types of}} {{infection}} alone however, {{have been unable to}} explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and fecal-oral pathogens, such as hepatitis A, Toxoplasma gondii, and Helicobacter pylori (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of <b>atopy</b> by more than 60%, and an increased rate of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma. It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation. Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.|$|E
25|$|Although genetic factors govern {{susceptibility}} to atopic disease, increases in <b>atopy</b> have occurred within too {{short a time}} frame to be explained by a genetic change in the population, thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes. Several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased rate; increased exposure to perennial allergens due to housing changes and increasing time spent indoors, and changes in cleanliness or hygiene that {{have resulted in the}} decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism, coupled with dietary changes, obesity and decline in physical exercise. The hygiene hypothesis maintains that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections. It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic {{urticaria}} {{has been}} seen {{in a few cases}} of CD. and are likely the result of fortuitous allergies to wheat, or allergies secondary to GSE. <b>Atopy</b> disorders {{have been found to be}} more common in celiacs and in first degree relatives. Celiac disease is associated with a number of epidermal conditions including Psoriasis ...|$|E
2500|$|Contact sensitivity, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and {{urticaria}} {{appear to}} be related phenomena the cause of which is generally {{believed to be the}} hydrophobic prolamin components of certain Triticeae, Aveneae cultivars, in wheat one of these proteins is ω-gliadin (Gli-B1 gene product). A study of mothers and infants on an allergen-free diet demonstrated that these conditions can be avoided if wheat sensitive cohort in the population avoid wheat {{in the first year of}} life. As with exercise induced anaphylaxis aspirin (also: tartrazine, sodium benzoate, sodium glutamate (MSG), [...] sodium metabisulfite, tyramine) may be sensitizing factors for reactivity. Studies of the wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis demonstrate that <b>atopy</b> and EIA can be triggered from the ingestion of that aspirin and probably NSAIDs allow the entry of wheat proteins into the blood, where IgE reacts within allergens in the dermal tissues. Some individuals may be so sensitive that low dose aspirin therapy can increase risk for both <b>atopy</b> and WDEIA.|$|E
2500|$|Low pH environments {{have been}} {{associated}} with antimicrobial activity and dogs have among the highest skin pH levels of any domesticated animal. Malassezia pachydermatis is most commonly isolated from areas of the skin and ears with higher pH levels. Therefore canine colonization may occur more readily due to the skins increased alkalinity. Samples have been collected from the ears, skin, vagina, and [...] anal sacs. Canine infection often co-occurs with <b>atopy</b> and other allergic disorders. In contrast, felines are rarely infected by M.pachydermatis but when Malassezia spp. dermatitis does occur, it is not typically associated with any other conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, <b>atopy.</b> Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E
2500|$|Skin {{diseases}} are {{very common in}} dogs. [...] <b>Atopy,</b> a chronic allergic condition, is thought to affect up to 10 percent of dogs. [...] Other skin diseases related to allergies include hot spots and pyoderma, both characterized by secondary bacterial infections, food allergy, ear infections, and flea allergy dermatitis. [...] Canine follicular dysplasia is an inherited disorder of the hair follicles resulting in alopecia (baldness). [...] Mange is an infectious skin disease caused by mites. [...] Endocrine diseases such as hypothyroidism and Cushing's syndrome can also manifest as skin problems like alopecia or recurring bacterial infections. Another class of integumentary malady is hygromas, a swelling typically {{on or near the}} elbow joint. Nutrition may also play a role in skin disease, as deficiencies in certain nutrients may result in scaling, redness, oiling, balding, and/or itching of the skin. Some nutrients that are particularly important to maintain healthy levels of for skin benefits include: vitamin A and B, essential faty acids, zinc, and proteins. Physical elements of certain dog breeds also affect susceptibility of individuals to skin problems. For instance, skin-fold dermatitis is a skin infection commonly found in breeds such as the bulldog, due to their excess amounts of loose skin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atopy</b> (atopic {{syndrome}}) is a syndrome {{characterized by}} {{a tendency to be}} “hyperallergic”. A person with <b>atopy</b> typically presents with {{one or more of the}} following: eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis (hay fever), or allergic asthma. Some patients with <b>atopy</b> display what is referred to as the “allergic triad” of symptoms, i.e. all three of the aforementioned conditions. Patients with <b>atopy</b> also have a tendency to have food allergies, allergic conjunctivitis, and other symptoms characterized by their hyperallergic state. For example, eosinophilic esophagitis is found to be associated with atopic allergies.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people with}} AD {{have a family}} history of <b>atopy.</b> <b>Atopy</b> is an immediate-onset {{allergic}} reaction (type 1 hypersensitivity reaction) that manifests as asthma, food allergies, AD or hay fever.|$|E
5000|$|Atopic {{reactions}} {{are caused by}} localized hypersensitivity reaction to an allergen. <b>Atopy</b> appears to show a strong hereditary component. One study concludes {{that the risk of}} developing atopic dermatitis (3%) or <b>atopy</b> in general (7%) [...] "increases by a factor of two with each first-degree family member already suffering from atopy". As well, maternal stress and perinatal programming is increasingly understood as a root cause of <b>atopy,</b> finding that [...] "...trauma may be a particularly robust potentiator of the cascade of biological events that increase vulnerability to <b>atopy</b> and may help explain the increased risk found in low-income urban populations.” ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Atopy</b> {{may have}} a {{hereditary}} component, although contact with the allergen or irritant must occur before the hypersensitivity reaction can develop. Maternal psychological trauma in utero {{may also be a}} strong indicator for development of <b>atopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{a strong}} genetic {{predisposition}} toward atopic allergies, especially on the maternal side. Because of the strong familial evidence, investigators have tried to map susceptibility genes for <b>atopy.</b> Genes for <b>atopy</b> (C11orf30, STAT6, SLC25A46, HLA-DQB1, IL1RL1/IL18R1, TLR1/TLR6/TLR10, LPP, MYC/PVT1, IL2/ADAD1, HLA-B/MICA) tend {{to be involved in}} allergic responses or other components of the immune system. C11orf30 seems to be the most relevant for <b>atopy</b> as it may increase susceptibility to poly-sensitization.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} of the small remote far South Atlantic Ocean island of Tristan da Cunha (266 permanent, genetically isolated residents) suffers a high prevalence of <b>atopy</b> and asthma. The CysLTR1 gene product variant, 300G/S (i.e. amino acid glycine replaces serine at the 300 position of the CysLTR1 protein), {{has been shown to}} be significantly associated with <b>atopy</b> in this population. The CysLTR1 300S variant exhibited significant increased sensitivity to LTD4 and LTC4 suggesting that this hypersensitivity underlies its association with <b>atopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Atopy</b> is a {{predisposition}} toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atopy</b> allergies {{start with}} itching, biting, hair loss and face rubbing. Other {{symptoms}} may be papules, which are small red bumps, or pustules, which are small pimple-like lesions. <b>Atopy</b> allergies are typically caused by fleas, {{but can also}} be caused by airborne, chemical, and {{by many of the}} common products found in your home.|$|E
50|$|C11orf30 {{has been}} shown to {{associate}} with <b>atopy</b> and susceptibility to poly-sensitisation.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the SPINK5 gene {{may result}} in Netherton syndrome, a {{disorder}} characterized by ichthyosis, defective cornification, and <b>atopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|There may be {{a genetic}} {{predisposition}} to the condition. People who develop OFG often {{have a history of}} <b>atopy,</b> such as childhood asthma or eczema.|$|E
50|$|Health issues include normal {{hereditary}} {{problems such}} as epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and <b>atopy.</b> Also common is cryptorchidism, which occurs in about 10% of all male dogs.|$|E
50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{examined}} possible links with <b>atopy</b> and exposure to infection early in life, use of hormones and fertility drugs, and maternal use of hair dye.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} kinds of dog allergies dogs may be suffering from. The five main allergies include food allergies, flea allergies, bacteria, contact, and <b>atopy</b> allergies.|$|E
5000|$|Risk Factors for asthma in {{children}} include: Babies born too early, born by C-section, Having <b>Atopy,</b> Allergens, Exposure to smoke and pollution, having {{a parent who}} has Asthma, and genetics.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>atopy</b> has various definitions, in general, it {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of elevated levels of total and allergen-specific IgE in the serum, leading to positive skin-prick tests to common allergens.|$|E
5000|$|... 927T/C (nucleotide thymine replaces {{cytosine}} {{at position}} 97 of the CysLTR1 gene) gene polymorphism in the coding region of CysLTR1 {{has been shown}} to be predictive of the severity of <b>atopy</b> (i.e. a predisposition toward developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions), but not associated with asthma, in a population of 341 Caucasians in afflicted sib-pair families from the Southampton area in the United Kingdom. This <b>atopy</b> severity was most apparent in female siblings but the incidence of this polymorphism is extremely low and the functionality of the 927T/C gene and its product protein are as yet unknown.|$|E
50|$|HES is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion, after clonal eosinophilia (such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA-fusion induced hypereosinophelia and leukemia) and reactive eosinophilia (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, <b>atopy,</b> hypoadrenalism, tropical eosinophilia, or cancer) have been ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Allergic {{conjunctivitis}} is {{a frequent}} condition as it is estimated to affect 20 {{percent of the population}} on an annual basis and approximately one-half of these people have a personal or family history of <b>atopy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Low-allergen {{foods are}} being developed, as are {{improvements}} in {{skin prick test}} predictions; evaluation of the <b>atopy</b> patch test; in wasp sting outcomes predictions and a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.|$|E
50|$|Severe {{and chronic}} eczema qualifies {{as one of}} the most {{frequent}} occupational illnesses. Patients should therefore be referred to an occupational-dermatological specialist as soon as possible. Patients with a history of neurodermitis, hay fever, or allergic asthma often develop hand eczema. These sicknesses reflect the individual's particular susceptibility or genetic predisposition to react over-sensitively to various environmental influences. This is described as <b>atopy</b> or <b>atopy</b> diathesis. Atopic diathesis is frequently accompanied by genetically conditioned problems with the skin's protective barriers, which causes a weakening of the skin's resistance against irritating substances and moisture, as well as easier penetration by allergens, which may lead to the development of contact allergies.|$|E
50|$|In {{children}} {{who are at risk}} for developing allergic diseases (defined as at least one parent or sibling having <b>atopy),</b> atopic syndrome can be prevented or delayed through 4-month exclusive breastfeeding, though these benefits may not persist.|$|E
