The thesis stresses {{the use of}} testing methods under operational like conditions as these are more representative of closed loop systems, such as machining systems, as compared to conventional testing methods.

The instrument uses electromagnetic excitation and displacement sensors for analysis of rotating milling tools subject to load. A graphical tool for displaying and analysing rotor displacement was developed in conjunction with this.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in the Netherlands shows a seasonal trend, with a peak {{in spring and}} a trough in autumn. Possible causes of this peak are winter crowding and a seasonal decrease in immune competence in spring. A third explanation may be a reporting bias. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of winter crowding by a time-series analysis of notification data. DNA fingerprinting clustering status can differentiate between recent and remote infections. Seasonality in clustered cases would reflect enhanced transmission in winter and/or seasonally lowered immunity, while seasonality in unique cases would only reflect seasonally lowered immunity. METHODS: We fitted (seasonal) <b>auto-regressive</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> <b>models</b> to culture-positive TB notifications in the Netherlands (1993 – 2008) to assess seasonality. We then used seasonal trend Loess decompositions to derive the seasonal pattern, and compared the heights of the seasonal peaks. RESULTS: Clustered and unique EPTB notifications showed a seasonal trend that was absent in clustered and unique PTB notifications. The seasonal peak in clustered EPTB cases was not significantly higher than in unique EPTB cases. CONCLUSIONS: The similar timing and height of the seasonal peak of clustered and unique EPTB cases suggests that winter crowding is unlikely to cause the seasonal trend in notifications...|$|R

40|$|A common {{technique}} to deploy linear prediction to non- stationary signals is time segmentation and local analysis. Variations {{of a process}} within such a segment cause inac- curacies. In this paper, we model the temporal changes of linear prediction coefficients (LPCs) as a Fourier series. We obtain a compact description of the vocal tract model limited by the predictor order and the maximum Doppler frequency. Filter stability is guaranteed by all-pass filtering, deploying the human ear’s insensitivity to absolute phase. The period- icity constraint induced by the Fourier series is counteracted by oversampling in the Doppler domain. With this approach, the number of coefficients required for the vocal tract model- ing is significantly reduced compared to a LPC system with block-wise adaptation while exceeding its prediction gain. As a by-product {{it is found that}} the Doppler frequency of the vocal tract is in the order of 10 Hz.

40|$|This paper advocates Riemannian multi-manifold {{modeling}} in {{the context}} of network-wide non-stationary time-series analysis. Time-series data, collected sequentially over time and across a network, yield features which are viewed as points in or close to a union of multiple submanifolds of a Riemannian manifold, and distinguishing disparate time series amounts to clustering multiple Riemannian submanifolds. To support the claim that exploiting the latent Riemannian geometry behind many statistical features of time series is beneficial to learning from network data, this paper focuses on brain networks and puts forth two feature-generation schemes for network-wide dynamic time series. The first is motivated by Granger-causality arguments and uses an <b>auto-regressive</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> <b>model</b> to map low-rank linear vector subspaces, spanned by column vectors of appropriately defined observability matrices, to points into the Grassmann manifold. The second utilizes (non-linear) dependencies among network nodes by introducing kernel-based partial correlations to generate points in the manifold of positive-definite matrices. Capitilizing on recently developed research on clustering Riemannian submanifolds, an algorithm is provided for distinguishing time series based on their geometrical properties, revealed within Riemannian feature spaces.

This is done by benchmarking four different NN designs representing a higher-order neural network (HONN), a Psi Sigma Network and a recurrent neural network with the classic multilayer perception (MLP) and some traditional techniques, either statistical such as an <b>auto-regressive</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> <b>model,</b> or technical such as a moving average convergence/divergence model, plus a naive strategy. More specifically, the trading performance of all models is investigated in a forecast and trading simulation on the EUR/USD ECB fixing time series over the period 1999 - 2007 using the last one and half years for out-of-sample testing, an original feature of this paper. We use the EUR/USD daily fixing by the ECB as many financial institutions are ready to trade at this level and it is therefore possible to leave orders with a bank for business to be transacted on that basis.
