25|$|When the war finally ended, Hamilton was <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> place. Women had {{permanently}} {{entered the}} paid workforce. The lean {{times of the}} Great Depression were over—and veterans {{were going to make}} sure that happened.|$|E
25|$|The Multnomah {{was one of}} {{the first}} steamboats to operate on the Willamette and Yamhill rivers. This vessel should not be {{confused}} with the Multnomah, a steamboat built in Portland, Oregon in 1885, which was larger and of <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> design.|$|E
25|$|Off {{the field}} Wojcicki had <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{vision for the}} product, and {{introduced}} an entirely new look for the team, as well as aiming to make game days a far more family oriented outing. He himself was just a recent convert to the game, having only attended a handful of games during the prior season {{at the urging of}} his young sons.|$|E
50|$|She was {{a member}} of Group Two of the first British A-class of {{submarines}} (<b>a</b> second, <b>much</b> <b>different</b> A-class submarine appeared {{towards the end of the}} Second World War). Like the other members of her class, she was built at Vickers Barrow-in-Furness.|$|R

If he hadn't she threatened divorce.|$|R
25|$|Peppers {{are highly}} nutritious. They have more Vitamin C than an orange, and a typical bell pepper {{contains}} more than 100% of the daily recommended value for Vitamin C. They also have relatively high amounts of Vitamin B6. Fresh fruit is 94% water. Dried pepper fruit has <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> nutritional value due to the dehydration and concentration of vitamins and minerals.|$|E
25|$|The album's {{recording}} was <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> affair {{from the}} first two—likely because of the band's constantly changing dynamic. The traditional country {{of the first two}} albums, especially Faithless, was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to Wilco's 1999 album Summerteeth. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including The Replacements' Tommy Stinson and The Smashing Pumpkins' James Iha.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Sauer planted a second {{vineyard}} about 3/4 {{of a mile}} west of Red Willow named Les Vignes de Marcoux after his mother's maiden name, Marcoux. This vineyard with it soft rolling hills had <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> topography than the steeper slopes of Red Willow. It was planted to newer clones {{of some of the}} Red Willow varieties but also to newer varieties such as Aglianico, Barbera and Carménère.|$|E

25|$|Reed and the Light Horse {{returned}} to Trenton with their captives mounted behind, probably to <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> reception by Continental infantrymen. The prisoners were separately interrogated, and revealed that General Grant had reinforced British troops at Princeton, that the force assembled there comprised over 8,000 trained soldiers, {{and that the}} British intended to advance on Trenton. This was critical intelligence; at the time, Washington commanded only 4,700 men, {{many of whom were}} new recruits, and all of whom were poorly equipped.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there was}} no orchestra, {{there was no}} space {{separating}} the audience from the stage. The audience could stand {{directly in front of}} the elevated wooden platform. This gave them the opportunity to look at the actors from <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> perspective. They would have seen every detail of the actor and hear every word he said. The audience member would have wanted that actor to speak directly to them. It was a part of the thrill of the performance, as it is to this day.|$|E
25|$|SH-67 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} on May 21, 1936, {{serving in the}} same capacity—connecting US 75 to US 64 south of Tulsa—as it does now, though with <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> route. The original SH-67 began at US-75 in Mounds (US-75 at the time using the present-day route of US-75ALT) and continuing east through far southern Tulsa County, reaching US-64 south of Bixby. The first extension to SH-67 occurred just over one month into the highway's life, on June 23, 1936. This extended the designation north along US-75 to Sapulpa. From here, it ran concurrent with US-66 out of town, splitting from US-66 to follow present-day SH-33 (which at this time followed SH-51 en route to downtown Tulsa) and {{coming to an end}} in Drumright.|$|E
50|$|Developers later {{started to}} work on J.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars. It was {{originally}} planned to be the Enhanced Edition of the game but thanks to success on Indiegogo, it became <b>a</b> remake with <b>much</b> <b>different</b> gameplay and story. The release date is scheduled for 2014.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designated}} as 1 Sagittarii by Flamsteed, {{but is now}} {{often referred to as}} 11 Sagittarii. Flamsteed's 11 Sgr actually refers to <b>a</b> <b>different,</b> <b>much</b> fainter star.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} not written by Shaw, but rather instead {{was written by}} Dame [...] "Dangerous" [...] Edwards and Keenan Foster. The {{original}} intent was to allow Too Short to adapt <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more <b>different</b> flow and rap to different subject matter. The song also contains a subliminal MC Hammer diss, who was another Oakland emcee that was high-charting, with his more pop-oriented content.|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Joseph Ligambi was {{released}} from prison after he successfully appealed his murder conviction and was acquitted at retrial. After 10 years in prison, Ligambi returned to <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> Mafia family that saw two violent regime changes and the family under the control of a group of young mobsters. Ligambi, who is Borgesi's uncle, was a Scarfo era soldier when he was imprisoned in 1987 and was also mentored by Merlino's father, Salvatore. Upon his release, Ligambi went right back to work for the crime family. He was well respected among his peers for staying strong when {{sentenced to life in prison}} instead of betraying his crime family to the authorities to escape prison time. When Merlino and company were arrested, Merlino named Ligambi acting boss of the family. Ligambi continued as acting boss after their convictions on racketeering related crimes in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines present <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{situation for}} the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E
25|$|Before {{recording}} By the Way (2002), the Chili Peppers {{decided that}} they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. In the past, Rubin had given the band creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Originally the album was headed in <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> direction than the final production. The album {{started out as a}} group of fast, hardcore punk songs, which Rubin rejected. Frusciante also wanted a darker, 1980s UK pop/new wave sound mixed in with 1980s hardcore. The recording process was tough for Flea, who felt like an outsider in the band and that his role was being diminished due to a musical power struggle with Frusciante. Flea wanted to create more funk-inspired songs, while Frusciante felt that the band had overused their funk side. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two eventually worked out all their problems.|$|E
50|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>much</b> faster paced remix, by Soulwax, which samples The B-52s song 52 Girls throughout. This remix {{ended up}} on their remix album 'Most of the Remixes'.|$|R
25|$|Some of Canis's chansons use a cantus-firmus technique, {{in which}} Canis takes a line {{or two of}} music from a {{pre-existing}} chanson, including examples by Janequin, Claudin de Sermisy, and Gombert, and reworks it in <b>a</b> contrapuntal texture <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the original, but using the same words.|$|R
50|$|In time, {{an empire}} may change from one {{political}} entity to another. To wit, the Holy Roman Empire, a German re-constitution of the Roman Empire, metamorphosed into various political structures (i.e., federalism), and eventually, under Habsburg rule, re-constituted {{itself as the}} Austrian Empire, <b>an</b> empire of <b>much</b> <b>different</b> politics and vaster extension.|$|R
500|$|While {{there were}} already {{successful}} African-American sportscasters, Scott blended hip-hop culture and sports {{in a way that}} had never been seen before on television. He talked {{in the same manner as}} fans would at home. [...] ESPN director of news Vince Doria told ABC: [...] "But Stuart spoke <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> language... that appealed to a young demographic, particularly a young African-American demographic." [...] Michael Wilbon wrote that Scott allowed his personality to infuse the coverage and his emotion to pour out.|$|E
500|$|Lukather {{describes}} 1997's Luke as <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{and more}} [...] "introspective" [...] album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection {{of many of}} Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences {{come out on the}} album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song [...] "The Pump". [...] The song [...] "Hate Everything About U" [...] was released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Jesse Schedeen gave Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, {{noting that}} the Flash episode was [...] "saddled with the setup" [...] while [...] "Arrow gets {{to have fun with}} the payoff." [...] He felt the pace and storyline issues in [...] "Legends of Tomorrrow," [...] the Flash episode, were {{resolved}} satisfactorily. [...] The inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it [...] "a larger scope and an added sense of drama". As well, the Ollie subplot allowed Stephen Amell [...] "to show <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> and more vulnerable side to his character". Alisdair Wilkins awarded the episode a B+ noting [...] "how much better the show's entire dynamic is this season compared with last year". [...] He added that [...] "Legends Of Yesterday" [...] shows Oliver's conflict between keeping his friends safe and recognizing he cannot be victorious without them.|$|E
30|$|Reservoir {{evaluation}} {{needs the}} data of many kinds of rocks, which have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more <b>different</b> porosity and permeability. The well logs have varieties of responses based on different kinds of rocks’ characteristic. And the lithology data is mainly carried out by cores recovery in lab which is very expensive and its interpretation is time consuming, so accurate identification of lithology from geophysical well log data {{plays a significant role}} in reservoir evaluation.|$|R
2500|$|She was {{the lead}} ship of the first British A-class {{submarines}} (<b>a</b> second, <b>much</b> <b>different</b> A-class [...] appeared {{towards the end of}} the Second World War), and the only one to have a single bow torpedo tube. She was actually sunk twice: first in 1904 when she became the first submarine casualty, with the loss of all hands; however, she was recovered, but sank again in 1911, this time when she was unmanned. The wreck was discovered in 1989 and is now a protected wreck.|$|R
5000|$|The gaita sanabresa {{features}} a single drone. The scale of this chanter {{is distinct from}} others in Spain, in <b>A</b> mode (Eolic) <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the gaita alistana of Aliste in D Mode (Doric) {{as well as the}} [...] "Gaita Mirandesa" [...] from Portugal. In playing, the fingering is generally open, though some players use semi-closed touches.|$|R
500|$|Although Noel rejoined Oasis a {{few weeks}} later, the band's {{management}} and handlers were worried. With an album's worth of songs already demoed, the general feeling among the Gallaghers was that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that [...] "in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move {{would have been to}} take {{the rest of the year}} off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you're a band and you've got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it." [...] Morris expressed opposite sentiments, arguing that [...] "It was a mistake on everyone's part, management very much included, that we didn’t record Be Here Now in the summer of 1996. It would have been <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> album: happy probably." [...] He described the Mustique demos as [...] "the last good recordings I did with Noel" [...] and had a good rapport with Gallagher before Knebworth, regarding the concert as having changed things for the worse.|$|E
500|$|Broken was {{followed}} by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992. The only track that was left off {{the final version of the}} release is Butch Vig's remix of [...] "Last" [...] (the outro of the [...] "Last" [...] remix is heard in [...] "Throw This Away", which also includes Vig's remix of [...] "Suck"). [...] The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11kHz file, [...] "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). [...] Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying [...] "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>much</b> <b>different</b> {{origin of}} the song was told on The Howard Stern Show in November 2011. Chris Martin {{explained}} to Stern that he was impersonating Neil Young while entertaining guests when he came across the first chord of the song, which stuck {{with him for a}} bit; then in a Neil Young voice he sang [...] "look at the stars". Martin went on to further explain that the word [...] "yellow" [...] has absolutely no meaning whatsoever and while writing the rest of the song he tried his best to change [...] "yellow" [...] to something else since every lyric before yellow made no sense but in the end the word [...] "yellow" [...] just sounded right. Martin also told Stern that through the years depending on the attitude and manner of whoever interviews him, he would make up some story about a song or album titles just {{to move on to the}} next question. Martin applauded Stern saying [...] "I like you, Howard, so that's the first time I've ever told anyone the truth behind 'Yellow'." ...|$|E
50|$|Because {{each course}} is different, {{handlers}} are allowed a short walk-through before the competition starts. During this time, all handlers competing {{in a particular}} class can walk or run around the course without their dogs, determining how they can best position themselves and guide their dogs {{to get the most}} accurate and rapid path around the numbered obstacles. The handler tends to run <b>a</b> path <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the dog's path, so the handler can sometimes spend quite a bit of time planning for what is usually a quick run.|$|R
50|$|Ughill Hall is a {{substantial}} stone residence which has been much altered over the years, it existed in <b>a</b> form <b>much</b> <b>different</b> from the present day building in the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042-1066). For many years it was {{the home of the}} Marriottts. In more recent times the hall was owned by Charles Vickers who used it as a summer shooting lodge and then by Mr. Lomas the owner of some of the mines in the surrounding area. The adjacent Ughill Hall farm is still a working farm.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} the Bounce Tour in August 2003, Bon Jovi {{embarked}} on a side project; originally intending to produce an album consisting of live acoustic performances, the band ended up rewriting, re-recording and reinventing 12 of their biggest hits in <b>a</b> new and <b>much</b> <b>different</b> light. Bon Jovi's [...] compilation album This Left Feels Right was released in November 2003.|$|R
