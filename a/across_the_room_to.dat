Half of the participants were assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|E
500|$|Two other {{episodes in}} the Buffy canon are also based on, or have {{elements}} of, fairy tales: [...] "Killed by Death", where only sick children {{can see a}} demon who sucks away their lives, and [...] "Gingerbread", where a demon takes on the forms of Hansel and Gretel to create a moral panic in Sunnydale. [...] "Hush" [...] is often compared to these episodes because they contain similar elements. Whedon intended The Gentlemen to be Brothers Grimm-like monsters, with Giles {{playing the role of}} the wise man, Buffy the princess, and Tara the [...] "little girl wandering through the woods". In this incarnation, however, Buffy is a swashbuckling princess whose scream saves the town. Instead of being the damsel in distress she is the hero, breaking through a boarded-up window in the belfry, then grabbing a rope and swinging <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> kill one of The Gentlemen's footmen by smashing her feet into his chest.|$|E
2500|$|Furtively, Godvino {{enters the}} room while a party is {{progressing}} in interior rooms. [...] He laments that Mina has not contacted him in any way and, in a pre-arranged plan, leaves a letter within {{the pages of a}} book to which he has a key. [...] However, unseen by Godvino, Briano has entered and observes Godvino's actions. He grows suspicious: [...] "a friend of Aroldo?", he wonders. [...] The guests flow into the room and Godvino is absorbed within the group. [...] They all express their joy at Aroldo's return. [...] Briano approaches Aroldo and explains what he has seen, pointing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> Enrico, Mina's cousin, as the one who planted the letter and who then picked up the book. [...] But he is amongst the group and is dressed {{in the same way as}} Godvino, so there is some confusion. [...] Suspicion falls on Enrico as Aroldo reveals that his honour has been betrayed. He tells of a similar situation in Palestine: Aria: Vi fu in Palestina / [...] "In Palestine there was once a certain man....", and confronts Mina, since he knows that she has a key to the book and [...] he believes that it too contains a secret letter. Mina's attempts to stall fail, and Aroldo breaks open the locked book and a letter drops from it to the floor. [...] Quickly stepping forward, Egberto picks it up stating that no one shall see it. [...] Aroldo is angry and Mina defends her father. Knowing the real culprit, Egberto confronts Godvino and demands that they meet in the churchyard.|$|E
60|$|Parlay skipped with {{astonishing}} nimbleness <b>across</b> <b>the</b> crowded <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> barometer on the wall.|$|R
60|$|Something <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> seemed <b>to</b> attract his {{attention}} {{and his voice}} trailed off. He inspected this for some time with bland interest, then turned to Adams once more.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} felt that she could walk; she tottered back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and her {{twitching}} fingers were once more fumbling with the bolts.|$|R
60|$|Hough led Neale <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> {{where he}} could look into the dance-hall.|$|E
60|$|I walked {{straight}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> {{the telephone and}} called up the agency.|$|E
60|$|He moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> throw open a window. Her eyes {{followed}} him wonderingly.|$|E
60|$|Pritchard wheeled an easy-chair <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{and called}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiter.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the very}} first glimpse of me the boy jumped up from <b>the</b> table, bounded <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> ran <b>to</b> me with his hands out, and, blushing, said, [...] "Don't you know me?" ...|$|R
50|$|Dawn {{launched}} {{an invitation to}} Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.|$|R
60|$|Her {{mother took}} her by the shoulders, and pushed her <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> her aunt.|$|E
60|$|Jesson looked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> Drexley, who {{was leaning}} against the wall with folded arms.|$|E
60|$|The man at {{the window}} {{suddenly}} dropped the curtain and spoke <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> them all.|$|E
60|$|But {{they could}} waste {{no time in}} investigating. The burning brands were {{dropping}} around them, and they leaped <b>across</b> <b>the</b> printing <b>room</b> <b>to</b> where they saw another passageway. This had a door, but the barrier stood wide open.|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed not}} to hear him. She had caught Mrs. Seventon's eye <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and rose <b>to</b> her feet.|$|R
6000|$|CRAMPTON. Well, {{perhaps as}} I am {{considerably}} the oldest person present, I--- (He finishes the sentence by sitting {{down a little}} rheumatically in the operating chair. Meanwhile, Philip, having studied him critically during his passage <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> nods <b>to</b> Dolly; and Dolly nods to Gloria.) ...|$|R
60|$|Derek roused himself, {{and looked}} gloomily <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> where he stood, warming his legs at the blaze.|$|E
60|$|Mademoiselle rose at {{once and}} shook out her skirts. She kissed her hand <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> her friend.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis withdrew precipitately, {{closing the}} door behind him. Mr. Weatherley glanced <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> where Arnold was standing.|$|E
60|$|To prove {{my words}} I opened the door, {{and he saw}} what the flood was doing. Nevertheless, he rose and tottered several times <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> trying <b>to</b> revive his strength. Though every bit of him was aching, I saw {{that he would make}} the attempt.|$|R
5000|$|A breakfast {{area was}} created {{on the south}} end of the kitchen by framing in an {{existing}} enclosed patio. The original breakfast area had shared space with the laundry. At the same time, the kitchen cabinetry was slightly modified and <b>the</b> stove moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new breakfast area.|$|R
60|$|The Duke paused, {{in his way}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> crowded {{reception}} <b>rooms,</b> <b>to</b> {{speak to}} his host, Sir Edward Bransome, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.|$|R
60|$|Kendricks motioned {{with his}} head <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> where the little woman with the {{blackened}} eyebrows was eating her dinner.|$|E
60|$|The telephone-bell, tinkling sharply, rescued Sally {{from the}} {{necessity}} of a reply. She forced herself <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> answer it.|$|E
60|$|And then of {{a sudden}} a Latin book was hurled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> land on a bureau, just missing the glass.|$|E
60|$|She {{rose and}} walked <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> by herself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window. As she passed Mr. Clare, {{the old man}} {{stretched}} out his claw-like fingers and caught her fast by the arm before {{she was aware of}} him.|$|R
6000|$|She {{made her}} best curtsy to Mrs. Dawson; she twittered, [...] "I won't have my husband leaving me so soon! I'm going over {{and pull the}} wretch's ears." [...] She rose with a jeune fille bow. She was self-absorbed and self-approving because she had {{attained}} that quality of sentimentality. She proudly dipped <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interest and commendation of all beholders, sat {{on the arm of}} Kennicott's chair.|$|R
60|$|He {{began at}} once a {{systematic}} search of the dressing-table, and after that of the writing-table in <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In one of the drawers he found a letter sealed; this he brought at once <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and handed <b>to</b> Miss Trelawny.|$|R
60|$|She came <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> {{the couch}} where I was sitting talking to Emily, {{and put her}} arm around my neck.|$|E
60|$|He had led her <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> one beyond, where already His Royal Highness {{was waiting}} for the {{beautiful}} Lady Blakeney.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a sharp}} tapping at the door. I moved <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> open it. Arthur {{threw his}} hat upon the table.|$|E
60|$|And {{tripping}} <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> daintily <b>to</b> {{a little}} mother-of-pearl inlaid desk, {{she opened it}} with a silver key, and took out two or three papers crumpled and rather stained with green, which she submitted to her friend. Laura took them and read them. They were love-verses sure enough--something about Undine--about a Naiad--about a river. She looked at {{them for a long}} time; but in truth the lines were not very distinct before her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Archie {{took another}} drink of ice-water to steady his shaking nerve-centers, pulled down his waistcoat, {{straightened}} his tie, and then, with {{something of the}} air of a Roman gladiator entering <b>the</b> arena, tottered <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Lucille turned <b>to</b> entertain the perplexed music-publisher.|$|R
50|$|Zoning and Hierarchy of spaces:An attempt of zoning is noticeable. Service {{areas are}} grouped {{together}} and {{located at the}} rear {{side of the building}} and stairs are at corners. A gradual sequences of spaces unfolds as we go up to the stairs on the transitional space- <b>the</b> veranda, <b>across</b> <b>the</b> living <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedrooms and beyond that the open interior court and then to the service blocks.|$|R
