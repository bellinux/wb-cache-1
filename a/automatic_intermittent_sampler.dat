The aim of this analysis was to compare estimates of longitudinal prevalence based on <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> at regular intervals with 24 - or 48 -hour recall, with estimates based on continuous surveillance. Methods: Based on 2 real datasets from Brazil and Guatemala, we developed a simulated dataset representing the diarrhea morbidity of 10, 000 individuals followed over 365 days. Results: Both the model and the real datasets showed that the standard deviation of the longitudinal prevalence increases with decreasing numbers of days sampled, so that a study sampling only a fraction of days would require a larger sample size. However, due to the correlation of diarrhea between consecutive days, sampling at 7 - to 14 -day intervals results in relatively small loss of precision and power compared with daily morbidity records, especially when the average diarrheal episode is long. A study based on morbidity data for every seventh day may require only a 5 %- 24 % larger sample size than a study with daily records, depending on the average duration of episodes. Using a recall period of 48 hours instead of 24 hours increases power if the average episode is short. Conclusions: The results question the necessity of continuous surveillance to estimate longitudinal prevalence. In addition to savings in cost and staff time, <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> of morbidity may improve validity by minimizing recall error and reducing the influence of surveillance on participants' behavior...|$|R

Transforming Z into R using relations that have been derived for other scales results in a bias and added uncertainty.

Existing Z-R relations were employed to investigate the behavior of aggregated Z-R relations with scale, the aggregation bias, and the variability of the estimated rain rate. The prefactor and the exponent of aggregated Z-R relations systematically diverge with scale, showing a break that is event-dependent in the temporal domain and nearly constant in space. The systematic error associated with the aggregation bias at a given scale can become of the same order as the corresponding random error associated with <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling.</b> The bias can be constrained by including information about the variability of Z within a certain scale of aggregation, and is largely captured by simple functions of the coefficient of variation of Z.

The present study compared {{this approach to}} the standard negative expiratory pressure (NEP) method. In total, 21 COPD patients were studied by applying both techniques to the same breath and in 15 patients the measurements were repeated after bronchodilator. For each patient and condition five NEP tests were performed and independently scored by three operators unaware of the FOT results. In 180 tests, FOT classified 53. 3 % as flow limited. On average, the operators scored 27. 6 % of tests flow limited and 47. 6 % non-flow limited, but could not score 24. 8 %. The methods disagreed in 7. 9 % of cases; in 78 % of these the NEP scores differed between operators. Bronchodilation reduced NEP and DX̄rs scores, with only the latter achieving significance. Averaging the operators 9 NEP scores, a threshold between 24. 6 – 30. 8 % of tidal volume being flow limited by NEP produced 94 % agreement between methods. In conclusion, when negative expiratory pressure and forced oscillation technique were both available they showed good agreement. As forced oscillation technique is automatic and can measure multiple breaths over long periods, it is suitable for monitoring expiratory flow limitation continuously and identifying patients 9 breathing close to the onset of expiratory flow limitation, where <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> may be unrepresentative...|$|R
