40|$|In an {{important}} {{article in the}} Yale Law Journal, James Pfander and Daniel Birk claim that adverseness is not required by Article III for cases arising under federal law. This Article takes the position that Pfander and Birk have not {{made the case for}} reconsidering adversity requirements for Article III cases. Adverseness may be present when there is adversity of legal interests, even when adverse argument is not present. From this perspective, a number of Pfander and Birk’s examples of non-contentious jurisdiction manifested adverseness. In rem-type proceedings such as bankruptcy and prize cases required the determination of <b>adverse</b> <b>interests,</b> <b>in</b> situations where impediments often existed to voluntary extrajudicial resolution. Service or notice in some form was generally provided, which gave opportunities for <b>adverse</b> argument. <b>In</b> addition, the issuance of warrants, while ex parte, involved <b>adverse</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> a context where predeprivation notice would undermine the utility of the proceeding, notice occurred on execution of the warrant, and opportunity for argument was then often available. Pfander and Birk’s examples of pension and naturalization determinations are not as readily characterized as adverse. The Court, however, treated federal judges’ pension determinations as appropriate, if at all, as the work of individual commissioners rather than Article III judges. Naturalization petitions are perhaps Pfander and Birk’s best example of non-contentious jurisdiction, but the Court explicitly approved the practice as appropriate under Article III only after provisions for notice to, and potential appearance by, the United States...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in electricity consumption {{has led to}} a sharp {{increase in}} energy demand which has risen environmental and sustainability concerns. To address this issue, there have been incentives, in some countries, to the deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity production. Departing from a real case study, a framework for investment appraisal of a SHP project under the Portuguese present market conditions is proposed and applied. The study departed from the discounted cash-flow evaluation, complemented by both sensitivity and risk analyses, in order to identify the main sources of risk and to assess the probability and impact of each risk event. The results obtained show that {{in the context of a}} regulated tariff the project is worthwhile due to a positive NPV. However, if electricity had to be sold at market prices, the project becomes unprofitable. The results put also in evidence the vulnerability of the investment to an <b>adverse</b> change <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Future SHP plant investments should take into account the need to operate in a free market and to compete with technologies based on fossil fuels or large hydro...|$|R

40|$|Modelling term-structure {{dynamics}} is {{an important}} component in measuring and managing the exposure of portfolios to <b>adverse</b> movements <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Model selection from the enormous term-structure literature is far from obvious and, to make matters worse, a number of recent papers have called into question the ability of some of the more popular models to adequately describe interest rate dynamics. The author, in attempting to find a relatively simple term-structure model that does a reasonable job of describing interest rate dynamics for risk-management purposes, examines two sets of models. The first set involves variations of the Gaussian affine term-structure model by modestly building on the recent work of Dai and Singleton (2000) and Duffee (2002). The second set includes and extends Diebold and Li (2003). After working through the mathematical derivation and estimation of these models, the author compares and contrasts their performance on a number of in- and out-of-sample forecasting metrics, their ability to capture deviations from the expectations hypothesis, and their predictions in a simple portfolio-optimization setting. He finds that the extended Nelson-Siegel model and an associated generalization, what he terms the "exponential-spline model," provide the most appealing modelling alternatives when considering the various model criteria.

40|$|Positions in {{financial}} instruments expose the owner to market risk, {{which refers to}} the possibility of loss in the market value of the positions due to <b>adverse</b> changes <b>in</b> <b>interest</b> rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices. The most extensively used risk measure in market risk management in banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is Value-at-Risk (VaR). This measure is an estimate of the largest potential loss due to market movements over a specified time interval with a given level of confidence. A proper introduction to the mathematical theory of VaR is given in this Thesis. The accuracy of the forecasts from the risk model is of great importance to the financial organization, because the external regulatory requirements, the internal risk management practices and the level of risk in the business depend on the estimates produced by the model. The systematic evaluation of the accuracy of the forecasts produced by the risk model is called backtesting. It is a regulatory prerequisite for the use of internal VaR model for market risk management in a bank. The major objectives of this Thesis are (i) to give an overview of different backtesting methods and the properties that are included in backtesting, and (ii) to formulate backtesting to a detailed process from an organizational perspective. The process formulation will address real life problems i...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Genomic and transcriptomic studies {{underpin}} much {{investigation in}} biology {{and should be}} included routinely in clinical trials such as vaccine studies to provide new insight into the development of immunity and the genetic basis for <b>adverse</b> reactions. <b>Interest</b> <b>in</b> collecting and storing genetic material for subsequent high-throughput meta-analyses has increased substantially in recent years. Participants in clinical trials represent an important and invaluable source of clinical material and data. METHODS: Here, {{the experience of a}} single center in obtaining informed consent for the collection and long-term storage of genetic material from children, adolescents and adults, involved in clinical vaccine trials is presented and discussed. RESULTS: In 11 completed vaccine studies involving almost 3000 individuals, high rates of consent (in excess of 96 %) for biobanking and future genetic testing were obtained. Rates were high for participants from all age groups; however, there was a significant increase toward greater uptake by older study participants. CONCLUSIONS: These high acceptance rates demonstrate that participants (and parents of young children) in vaccine studies are willing to consent and engage in genetic research, which provides support for routinely collecting genetic material in research involving healthy participants such as clinical vaccine trials...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} rimonabant’s {{withdrawal}} from the European market due to its <b>adverse</b> effects, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the development of drugs based on CB 1 antagonists is revamping {{on the basis of}} the peculiar properties of this class of compounds. In particular, new strategies have been proposed for the treatment of obesity and/or related risk factors through CB 1 antagonists, i. e. by the development of selectively peripherally acting agents or by the identification of neutral CB 1 antagonists. New compounds based on the lead CB 1 antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant have been synthesized with focus on obtaining neutral CB 1 antagonists. Amongst the new derivatives described in this paper, the mixture of the two enantiomers (# 1;) - 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -(2 -cyclohexyl- 1 -hydroxyethyl) - 4 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazole ((# 1;) - 5), and compound 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 3 -[(Z) - 2 -cyclohexyl- 1 -fluorovinyl]- 4 - methyl- 1 H-pyrazole ((Z) - 6), showed interesting pharmacological profiles.

They also significantly decreased lipid accumulation and the expressions of two major adipogenesis factors, PPARγ and C/EBPα, in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. In addition, the PG-VN combination had synergistic effects compared with the mixture of extracts of PG and VN on inhibition of PPARγ and C/EBPα expressions at lower doses.
