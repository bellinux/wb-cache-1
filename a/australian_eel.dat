40|$|For some time, stanniocalcin (STC) {{has been}} {{described}} as a homodimeric glycoprotein that is involved in calcium and phosphate regulation. This hormone was first discovered within small kidney-associated endocrine glands, referred to as the corpuscles of Stannius (CS), that occur only in certain rayfinned fishes (Actinopterygii), the holostean and teleostean fishes. Recently, it was revealed that several mammalian tissues also contain STC and that STC mRNA expression is also present in many tissues and organs. Similar to the function in fish, mammalian STC plays a role in mineral metabolism. Primary structures of fish STC have been determined only in basal and generalized teleosts, such as several salmonid species and the <b>Australian</b> <b>eel.</b> Knowledge of the primary structure of STC in both more ancient and more derived actinopterygians would help in our understanding of the evolution of this molecule. At the same time, sequence comparison of STC could assist in our view of the taxonomic relationship of the various groups of fishes. The present report describes recent data that are part of...|$|E
40|$|Eels have an {{uncommon}} catadromic life cycle with exceptional migratory patterns to their spawning grounds several thousand kilometres away: the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) travels over 5, 500 km to the Sargasso Sea (Schmidt 1923; McCleave and Kleckner 1987; Tesch 1982; Tesch and Wegner 1990); the American eel (A. rostrata) migrates over 4, 000 km {{also to the}} Sargasso Sea (Castonguay and McCleave 1987; McCleave and Kleckner 1987; Tesch and Wegner 1990); the <b>Australian</b> <b>eel</b> (A. aus-tralis) travels over 5, 000 km into the Pacific Ocean to spawn (Jellyman 1987); and the Japanese eel (A. japonica) travels over 4, 000 km to an area near the Marianna Islands in the Philippines to spawn (Tsukamoto 1992). Evidently such long distance swimming will place those fishes under extra stress caused by the long starvation period, the high energy cost of the journey, and the many changes in the environment such as salt water, darkness, high pressure, and low temperatures, among other stress factors. Stress is often a basis for disease in eel, especially in intensive eel culture (Haenen and Engelsma, 2005 unpublished finding). Nowadays, global transport of live fishes for aquaculture has facilitated the global spread of pathogens from diseased to healthy stocks. Within the last few decades, aquaculture has become an important production branch in our society. Its global production {{has more than doubled}} between 1986 and 1996 in tonnage and value, and over one quarter of human fish consumption at world scale is now produced in aquaculture (Naylor et al. 2000). The Netherlands {{is one of the leading}} eel producing & trading countries (Heinsbroek and Kamstra 1995). Blanc (1997) showed that nearly 100 pathogens have been introduced into European water bodies since the introduction of aquaculture. Worldwide many diseases are known in both wild and cultured eel. Parasites, for example trematodes, Anguillicola crassus(nematode), and Myxidium giardi (myxosporean) occur naturally in wild eel populations, mostly in low numbers, without causing mortality (Køie 1988; Van Banning and Haenen 1990; Borgsteede et al. 1999). However, under culture conditions, with eels kept in high densities, they may be harmful. Eel pathogenic bacteria like Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio anguillarum, Pseudomonas anguillisepticaand Edwardsiella tardamay also cause disease, especially when a stress factor is involved or when the eel is injured (Veenstra et al. 1993; Austin and Austin 1999; Haenen and Davidse 2001). As far as we know, the clinical signs are often more severe under culture conditions compared to in the wild...|$|E

5000|$|The fish {{assemblage}} of the Snowy River below Jindabyne are clearly {{divided into two}} components. This division is based on that which occurred in the upper catchment (above Snowy Falls) {{and that in the}} lower catchment (below Snowy Falls). [...] The major differences between the two zones were the low abundance or absence of diadromous migratory fish (except eels) and the greater abundance of short-finned eel and trout in the upper catchment, and the greater abundance of Australian smelt, congoli and long-finned eel below Snowy Falls. These upper and lower Snowy River zone differences were greater than the differences between un-regulated tributary streams and the highly regulated main channel of the Snowy River within either zone. In the upper catchment, river blackfish, brown trout and short-finned eel were more abundant in un-regulated tributaries, whilst long-finned eel and goldfish were more abundant in the regulated upper part of the Snowy River.

This investigation was conducted to determine apparent digestibility coefficients of available plant and animal meals for the juvenile <b>Australian</b> short-finned <b>eel</b> (Anguilla australis australis Richardson). The suitability of a modified Guelph-type settlement faecal collector in eel digestibility studies was assessed. Animal by-product (meat; blood; poultry) and plant protein (soybean; canola; corn gluten; lupin; field pea) meals were mixed with a reference diet and marker (0. 3 : 0. 69 : 0. 01) and the resultant test diets fed to the juvenile eels (3. 15 plus or minus 0. 42 g) at 5 % BW/d. The reference diet and all the test diets were accepted and consumed at the fed ration. Apparent digestibility coefficients for crude protein (ADCCP) for all test ingredients were between 0. 85 and 0. 97. However, apparent digestibilities for dry matter (ADCDM) and energy (ADCkJ) were significantly (P< 0. 0001) higher for animal by-products than for plant proteins except for corn gluten meal. This was explained by the higher content of nitrogen free extractives in the former plant proteins. There were significant (P< 0. 01) positive correlations between ADCDM and ADCkJ (r = + 0. 98), ADCDM and ADCCP (r = + 0. 62) and between ADCCP and ADCkJ (r = + 0. 55).

The present study was undertaken to gain a preliminary understanding of basic husbandry requirements for rearing of juvenile A. australis (glass eels and elvers) in tanks and earthen ponds. Newly caught glass eels were successfully acclimated to culture conditions. During tank culture trials, specific growth rates (SGR) and survival rates ranged from − 2. 1 to 2. 8 % day − 1 and 52 % to 100 % respectively. Glass eels weaned onto a commercial eel diet exhibited a significantly greater SGR and survival rate than those weaned onto a commercial trout diet. Glass eels weaned onto an eel diet over a 15 -day period grew slightly faster than eels weaned over a 5 -day period, but survival rates were not significantly different for each treatment. SGRs (up to 2. 8 % day − 1) were significantly higher for glass eels fed at 9 and 12 % day − 1 than at 6 % day − 1. Stocking densities between 2. 5 kg m − 3 and 30 kg m − 3 did not influence either SGR or survival rates. SGRs were significantly higher for glass eels cultured at 25 °C than at lower temperatures.

The present experiments were conducted on glass <b>eels</b> of the <b>Australian</b> shortfin <b>eel,</b> when the effectiveness of four types of readily available fish roe (European carp, mirror dory, orange roughy and warehou) were evaluated over a 42 -day period, in the laboratory. After 28 days the eels did not show an interest in orange roughy and mirror dory roe, and these two treatments were discontinued to avoid mortality. In all treatments there was a decrease in mean weight during this period, but the survival was over 99 %. In the 28 th to 42 nd day period the mean weight and specific growth rate of glass eels reared on European carp and warehou roe increased, but the differences between these two treatments were not significant. The physical features of the roe and the oocytes thereof, the proximate composition, amino acid and fatty acid composition indicated major differences amongst the roe types, particularly with regard to the amount of n− 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the ratio of n− 3 to n− 6. European carp and warehou roe (and oocytes) had a significantly higher arachidonic acid (AA- 20 : 4 n− 6; over 60 % of PUFA) content and a considerably lower n− 3 to n− 6 ratio (n− 3 to n− 6 ratio being 1. 32, 5. 92, 3. 77 and 2. 67 for roe types, and 1. 25, 4. 83, 2. 91 and 2. 42 for oocytes, of European carp, mirror dory, orange roughy and warehou, respectively), than in the other two roe types.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the mechanisms by which nitric oxide (NO) regulates the dorsal aorta and the intestinal vein of the <b>Australian</b> short-finned <b>eel</b> Anguilla australis. NADPH diaphorase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry using a mammalian endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS) antibody could not demonstrate NOS in the endothelium of either blood vessel; however, NOS could be readily demonstrated in the endothelium of the rat aorta that {{was used as a}} control. Both blood vessels contained NADPH diaphorase positive nerve fibres and nerve bundles, and immunohistochemistry using a neural NOS antibody showed a similar distribution of neural NOS immunoreactivity in the perivascular nerves. In vitro organ bath physiology showed that a NO/soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) system is present in the dorsal aorta and the intestinal vein, since the soluble GC inhibitor oxadiazole quinoxalin - 1 (ODQ; 10 – 5 mol l – 1) completely abolished the vasodilatory effect of the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 10 – 4 mol l – 1). In addition, nicotine (3 x 10 – 4 mol l – 1) mediated a vasodilation that was not affected by removal of the endothelium. The nicotine-mediated dilation was blocked by the NOS inhibitor, Nω-nitro-arginine (L-NNA; 10 – 4 mol l – 1), and ODQ (10 – 5 mol l – 1). More specifically, the neural NOS inhibitor, Nω-propyl-L-arginine (10 – 5 mol l – 1), significantly decreased the dilation induced by nicotine (3 x 10 – 4 mol l – 1). Furthermore, indomethacin (10 – 5 mol l – 1) did not affect the nicotine-mediated dilation, suggesting that prostaglandins are not involved in the response. Finally, the calcium ionophore A 23187 (3 x 10 – 6 mol l – 1) caused an endothelium-dependent dilation that was abolished in the presence of indomethacin. We propose the absence of an endothelial NO system in eel vasculature and suggest that neurally derived NO contributes to the maintenance of vascular tone in this species. In addition, we suggest that prostaglandins may act as endothelially derived relaxing factors in A. australis. <br /...|$|R

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the growth of elvers (5. 4 g ± 0. 1 initial weight) fed with diets of varying protein and lipid content, and to assess the potential of using soya-bean meal as a dietary ingredient. A 10 week experiment was conducted at 24 (± 1. 0) °C by rearing fish, in 60 L conical fibre glass tanks using a closed recirculation system. Diets having protein concentrations of 40 or 50 % (by dry weight) were tested at three lipid levels (15, 20, 25 %); diets being designated P 40 L 15, P 40 L 20, P 40 L 25, P 50 L 15, etc. All these diets contained 5 % soya-bean meal. In addition P 50 L 20 diets were formulated to contain 10 and 20 % soya-bean meal in the diet (Diets S 1 & S 2). Shortfin eel grew best on the P 50 L 15 diet, with an average specific growth rate of 2. 26 %. Food conservation ratio (FCR) and Protein efficiency ratio (PER) ranged from 1. 21 (P 50 L 15) to 2. 12 (P 40 L 25), and 0. 92 (P 50 L 25) to 1. 65 (P 50 L 15), respectively. Based on all criteria the best growth performance of shortfin eel was on the P 50 L 15 diet, followed by P 40 L 20 and P 40 L 15.

Apparent percent protein and energy digestibilities of the diets were not significantly (P> 0. 05) affected by the lipid source, but the lipid digestibility was. The percent apparent lipid digestibility was lowest in the LO diet (90. 2 ± 0. 6) and highest in the CLO diet (95. 6 ± 0. 2). Not all the fatty acids present in any one diet were recovered in the faecal samples. In diets with CLO, only three saturates (out of five), five monoenes and six (out of 11) PUFAs were detected in faecal samples. With all the diets, 20 : 0 and 22 : 0, {{and none of the}} n − 6 HUFA were detected in the faecal samples. The digestibility of all the fatty acids, except 18 : 3 n − 3, was lowest in the diet with LO, and significantly so (P > 0. 05) from the other diets. In shortfin eel, there was a trend for the digestibility of saturated fatty acids of diets with the animal oil as the lipid source to decrease with increasing chain length, and in diets with vegetable oil to increase initially and then decrease. A somewhat comparable trend was also evident in respect of monoenes. When the digestibility of different categories of fatty acids is considered, the digestibility of saturates, monoenes, unsaturates, n − 6, PUFA, HUFA and total fatty acid digestibilities of LO diet were the lowest, and differed significantly (P < 0. 05) from those of the CLO and SFO diets, except in the case of n − 3 fatty acids. <br /...|$|R

30|$|Due {{to their}} mysterious life history and {{economic}} importance, freshwater eels (Anguilla spp.) {{have been the}} focus of much scientific research for decades. However, despite these efforts, most of the aspects of their early life history are still not completely understood. In the past three decades, dramatic declines in glass eel recruitment of temperate species like the American (Anguilla rostrata), European (Anguilla anguilla), Japanese (Anguilla japonica), and <b>Australian</b> (Anguilla australis) <b>eels</b> have raised concerns (Jellyman et al. 2000; Hoyle and Jellyman 2002; Tatsukawa 2003; Dekker 2008; Richkus and Whalen 2000). The reasons for the declines are unclear but are probably due to reductions in spawning stocks (Jansen et al. 2007; Winter et al. 2007; Clevestam et al. 2011), overfishing (Tzeng et al. 1995; Moriarty and Dekker 1997; Jellyman et al. 2000; Hoyle and Jellyman 2002; Briand et al. 2003; Chisnall et al. 2003; Dekker 2003; Lin et al. 2010), growth habitat and access reductions (Busch et al. 1998; Haro et al. 2000; McCleave 2001; McCleave and Jellyman 2004; Verreault et al. 2004; Graynoth et al. 2008), pollution (Amiard-Triquet et al. 1988; Robinet and Feunteun 2002; Palstra et al. 2006; van Ginneken et al. 2009), swim bladder and gill parasites and viral infections (Haenen et al. 2002; Szekely et al. 2002; Kirk 2003; Sures and Knopf 2004; van Ginniken et al. 2005; Han et al. 2008, 2009 a; Sasal et al. 2008; Parker et al. 2011), global climate change (Castonguay et al. 1994; Kimura et al. 2001; Casselman 2002; Knights 2003; Han et al. 2006, 2009 b; Friedland et al. 2007; August and Hicks 2008; Bonhommeau et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009), and the solar cycle (Tzeng et al. 2012). To understand the declines, it is necessary to study the early life history of anguillid eels. The life history of eels during the continental growth phase is well documented, but knowledge of the marine larval life stage from the spawning ground to the estuary is still fragmented (McCleave 1993; Cheng and Tzeng 1996; Wang and Tzeng 2000; Tzeng 2003; Edeline et al. 2009; Miller 2009). Early life history information is very important because it is a key factor in understanding possible reasons for recruitment success or failure of anguillid eels and also for their artificial propagation.|$|R
