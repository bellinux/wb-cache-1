Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, <b>and</b> <b>Bond</b> establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{adhesive}} resistance of metallic brackets bonded to temporary crowns made of acrylic resin after different surface treatments. METHODS: 180 specimens {{were made of}} Duralay and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30) according to surface treatment <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> material: G 1 - surface roughening with Soflex <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 2 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 3 - application of monomer <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Duralay; G 4 - roughening with Soflex <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond XT; G 5 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond XT and G 6 : application of monomer <b>and</b> <b>bonding</b> with Transbond. The results were statistically assessed by ANOVA/Games-Howell. RESULTS: The means (MPa) were: G 1 = 18. 04, G 2 = 22. 64, G 3 = 22. 4, G 4 = 9. 71, G 5 = 11. 23, G 6 = 9. 67. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) ranged between 2 and 3 on G 1, G 2 and G 3 whereas in G 4, G 5 and G 6 it ranged from 0 to 1, showing that only the material affects the pattern of adhesive flaw. CONCLUSION: The surface treatment and the material influenced adhesive resistance of brackets bonded to temporary crowns. Roughening by aluminum blasting increased bond strength when compared to Soflex, in the group bonded with Duralay. The bond strength of Duralay acrylic resin was superior to that of Transbond XT composite resin...|$|R
