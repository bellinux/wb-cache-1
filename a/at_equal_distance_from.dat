40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{triangle}} formed by three points each on a Fermat {{line of a}} given triangle, and <b>at</b> <b>equal</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the vertices. For two specific values of the common distance, the triangle degenerates into a line. The two resulting lines are the axes of the Steiner ellipse of the triangle. 1. The Fermat lines This paper is on {{a variation of the}} theme of Bottema [2]. Bottema studied the triangles formed by three points each on an altitude of a given triangle, <b>at</b> <b>equal</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the respective vertices. See Figure 1. He obtained many interesting properties of this configuration. For example, these three points are collinear when the common distance is R ± d, where R is the circumradius and d the distance between the circumcenter and the incenter of the reference triangle. The two lines containing the two sets of collinear points are perpendicular to each other at the incenter, and are parallel to the asymptotes of the Feuerbach hyperbola, the rectan-gular hyperbola through the vertices, the orthocenter, and the incenter. See Figure 2. ...|$|R

This geometry problem {{which is the}} major focus of the talk today dates back to at least 1815, when it appeared as question 1029 in The Gentleman’s Diary. One of the solvers was W. G. Horner whose name is associated with Horner’s Method of approximating zeros of polynomials. In R. A. Johnson’s treatise of 1929 [11], a proof by Mackay from the 1884 proceedings of the Edinburg Math Society {{is given to the}} more general theorem: Theorem. Given a complete quadrangle inscribed in a circle, if any line cuts two opposite sides <b>at</b> <b>equal</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the center of the circle, it cuts each pair <b>at</b> <b>equal</b> <b>distances</b> <b>from</b> the center.

A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|R
