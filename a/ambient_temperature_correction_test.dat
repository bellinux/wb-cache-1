40|$|Photochemical {{transformation}} of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) has been studied {{for more than two}} decades. Usually, laboratory or "in-situ" experiments are used to determine photodegradation variables. A common problem with these experiments is that the photodegradation experiments are done at higher than <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Five laboratory experiments were done to determine the effect of temperature on photochemical degradation of DOM. Experimental results showed strong dependence of photodegradation on temperature. Mathematical modeling of processes revealed that two different pathways engaged in photochemical {{transformation of}} DOM to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) strongly depend on temperature. Direct oxidation of DOM to DIC dominated at low temperatures while conversion of DOM to intermediate particulate organic carbon (POC) prior to oxidation to DIC dominated at high temperatures. It is necessary to consider this strong dependence when the results of laboratory experiments are interpreted in regard to natural processes. Photodegradation experiments done at higher than <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> will necessitate <b>correction</b> of rate constants...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{describe}} {{the effect of}} <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on metabolic rate after thermal injury. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Thermal injury induces a hypermetabolic state, which is reported to increase with the extent of burn. The magnitude of this response is further influenced by <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> METHODS: The resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 22, 28, 32, and 35 C. It was indexed to a calculated basal metabolic rate in normal volunteers and adult patients with burns involving at least 20 % of the {{total body surface area}} who had no evidence of systemic infection. These measurements were performed between postburn days 6 and 21. RESULTS: The effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on metabolic rate was measured in 44 burn patients and 8 normal volunteers. Burn size ranged from 20 to 97 % total body surface area with a mean of 44 +/- 18. 5 % total body surface area. Metabolic rate did not change significantly in control subjects as <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied (p< 0. 05). Regression analysis showed that burn size and <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> were significant determinants (p< 0. 01) of metabolic rate in the patients and that together these factors accounted for 55 % of the variation observed (df adj. r(2) = 0. 55) across the range of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> studied. Metabolic rate was independent of burn size at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 32 and 35 C (p< 0. 02) and increased by a factor of 1. 5 X basal metabolic rate. A further increase in metabolic rate, which was positively correlated with burn size, resulted from nonshivering thermogenesis at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> 28 and 22 C. The magnitude of this response was greatest at 22 C. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the hypermetabolic response to thermal injury is maximal in burns as small as 20 % total body surface area and that an additional burn size-dependent increase in metabolic rate results from heat loss at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> below thermoneutrality...|$|R
