[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Bu çalışmada İTÜ Hafif Ticari Helikopterinin tork tüpü yapılması amaçlanmıştır. Helikopterlerde bulunan ve daha önce İTÜ-ROTAM’da tasarımı ve testleri yapılmış tork tüpleri incelenmiştir. İTÜ-HTH’ı hakkında genel bilgiler verilmiştir. İTÜ-HTH, altı yolcu,iki pilot kapasiteli tek motorlu helikopterdir. İTÜ-HTH’ın en önemli özellikleri güvenirliği, kullanım kolaylığı,düşük ses seviyesi, maliyetidir. Yataksız hub sistemine ve kompozit palalara sahip olması, yüksek Anadolu platosunda yüksek irtifa görevlerini rahatlıkla yerine getirebilecek olması, düşük ana rotor dönüş devrinin sonucu olarak düşük uç hızına ve düşük ses seviyesine sahip olması İTU-HTH’ı rakiplerinden ayıran özelliklerdir. İTÜ-HTH havada asılı kalma, düşük hızda seyir uçuşu, uzun mesafe uçuşu gibi farklı görevleri yapabilmek için tasarlanmıştır. İTÜ-HTH ticari uygulamalar, kamu uygulamaları ve kişisel uygulamalar için kullanılabilir. İTÜ-HTH’ı oluşturan gövde, iniş takımı, uçuş kontrol sistemi,itki sistemi, güç aktarma sistemi, yakıt sistemi, elektrik sistemi ve ana rotor sistemi hakkında bilgiler verilmiştir. İTÜ-HTH’ın farklı uçuş şartları altında performans analizleri yapılmıştır. Tasarım isterleri doğrultusunda, farklı uçuş şartları altında çalışabilecek tork tüp tasarımı yapılmıştır. Tork tüpünün sonlu elemanlar modeli oluşturulmuştur. Sonlu elemanlar modeline uygun sınır şartları ve kuvvetlerin uygulanması ile sonlu elemanlar analizleri tamamlanmıştır. Analiz sonucu oluşan gerilme değerleri incelenmiştir. Tork tüpünün üretimi için teknik resimleri hazırlanmıştır. Pala kesiti üzerine tork tüp montajı yapılmıştır. İTÜ-ROTAM’da bulunan yapı laboratuvarında MTS Test cihazı ve yardımcı ekipmanlar yardımıyla tork tüpünün yapısal testleri {{standart}} ve ekstrem uçuş şartları olmak üzere iki farklı durum için yapılmıştır. Yapısal testlerde, aerodinamik momentleri modellemek amacıyla çelik kiriş kullanılmıştır. Standart uçuş şartları etkisinde, tork tüpünün 75 uçuş saati (1500000 çevrim) süresince kırıma uğramaması için yorulma testi yapılmıştır. Merkezkaç testi standart uçuş şartları yorulma testleri sonrasında yapılmıştır. Tork tüpe merkezkaç kuvvetin iki ve üç katı kuvvet uygulanarak çekilmiştir. Standart uçuş şartları testlerinde elde edilen gerilme değerleri, emniyetli akma gerilmesi değerinden düşüktür. Ekstrem uçuş şartlar etkisinde tork tüpün statik ve yorulma testleri yapılmıştır. Ekstrem uçuş testlerinde elde edilen gerilme değerleri, emniyetli akma gerilmesi değerinden düşüktür. Testler sırasında tork tüp üzerinde tasarım problemleri görülmüştür. Tasarım probleminin giderilmesi için tork tüp tasarımı üzerinde değişiklik yapılmıştır. Bundan sonraki çalışmalarda tasarımda yapılan değişikliklerden dolayı, yapılan sonlu elemanlar analizlerinin tekrarlanması gerekmektedir. Sonlu elemanlar analizlerin tamamlanması ile beraber, üretim için teknik resimler güncellenerek, üretim gerçekleştirilmelidir. Tork tüpünün üretiminin tamamlanması ile tasarım üzerinde yapılan değişikliklerden dolayı, bazı yapısal testler yapılarak tork tüp tasarımının güvenilirliği sağlanmalıdır. The aim of {{the project}} is designing of a <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> of the helicopter. Firstly, Torque tupe systems were investigated and also <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> that were tested in İTU-ROTAM, were examined. General informations of ITU-LCH were explained. ITU-LCH is designed as a six passenger, two pilot, single engine conventional helicopter. Critical attritubes of the ITU-LCH have been identified as; safety,affordability,ease of use,lower noise levels, high reliability, low cost maintainability. Main features of the ITU-LCH have been identified as; high altitude operation capability over the high Anatolian Plateau, beaeringless hub system design, composite rotor blades, lower rotor RPM with lower tip speed and hence lower noise levels, lower disc loading with relatively lower power requirement. ITU-LCH designed to be versatile {{in its ability to}} perform operations such as hover,low speed loiter and long range cruise for a variety of mission profiles such as; personal travel applications, commercial applications, corporate applications and government applications. General informations about components and systems of ITU-LCH were given such as; fuselage, landing gear, flight control system, propulsion system, transmission system,fuel system, electrical system and rotor system. The performance analysis of ITU-LCH was taken in different flight conditions. As the criteria of torque tupe design, attact angle of rotor blade conversion and effect of aerodynamic moments on rotor blade were investigated due to the performance analysis. <b>Torque</b> <b>tube</b> angle change must be around ± 15 °. In spite of the results of design criteria, <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> design that easily assemblied to the rotor blade were completed. ITU-LCH has four blades so there are four <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> on rotor system. During the helicopter works, <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> should not crash. <b>Torque</b> <b>tube</b> included some parts such as; blade root shaft, tube input part, tubes, tubes’ stand, flexible couplins and blade cutaway part. Spherical bearing is on the blade root shaft. Displacements in the axial direction are restricted and freedom of the rotation provided. Tube input part and tubes transfer the force from swashplate mechanisim to blade. Tube input part rotates ± 15 °. Tubes’ stand connects tubes and flexible couplings. Flexible coupling, is rigid in the direction of torsion, is flexible in the direction of bending. Flexible couplings works as a multi-tier spring system. Blade cutaway part connects flexible couplings and blade. Material of blade root shaft, tube input part, tubes, tubes stand is aluminium. Material of flexible couplings and blade cutaway part is steel. Finite element model of <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> were prepared. Appropriate boundary conditions of finite element model and finite element analysis with force application were carried out. The tensile strength values of <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> parts obtained by finite element analysis lower than the safe yield stress value. Therefore, It can be said that structural design of <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> is safe. In order to produce <b>torque</b> <b>tube,</b> technical drawings were prepared. 5 ABM prepared list of the necessary materials for production of <b>torque</b> <b>tube.</b> After the production, <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> were assemblied on the test blade. Structural tests of <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> were done by MTS tests equipment and other test equipments in ITU-ROTAM Structural Laboratory. Structural tests of <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> were done for standard flight conditions and extreme flight conditions. During the standard flight conditions tests, force applied to <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> which is assembled to blade. Blade angle of attack changed because of force. Boundary conditions were seen during this test. Steel beam’s dimension was calculated for the model of aerodynamic moment. Steel beam were tested in the MTS test equipments. Test results are as same as calculation of beam. Strain gages were glued high stress value point on <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> parts using finite element analysis. <b>Torque</b> <b>tube</b> should work during minimum 75 hours (1500000 cycles) on helicopters. <b>Torque</b> <b>tube</b> on test blade connected steel beam with shaft. Helicopter rotation speed is 5. 2 Hz. However, fatigue test were done at 1. 5 Hz because of the MTS test equipments condition so fatigue test finished after 300 hours. Fatigue test were stopped after some cycles and strain values were evaluated using strain gages because any changing on <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> parts have been seen. After the fatigue tests, stress values on the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> is lower than reliable yield stress. After the fatigue test of standard flight conditions, centrifugal test were done. Axial force, is two and three times centrifugal force, applied to <b>torque</b> <b>tube.</b> After the tests, stress on the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> is low. Stress on the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> is lower than reliable yield stress. For extreme flight conditions, steel beam’s dimensions were calculated again for model of the high aerodynamic moments. Static structural tests and fatigue test were done. During the static tests, <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> with high aerodynamic moments effects were done so strain values were read by strain gages. Fatigue tests continued during 2000 cycles. After the static tests and fatigue test, there is any broken part. After these tests, <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> is reliable for flight During the tests, design problems have been noticed. As a result of the force which applied to the <b>torque</b> <b>tube,</b> the angular variation of the torque pipe input part {{is not the same as}} angular variation of the angle of attack. However, angular variation of the angle of attack will be enough if the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> works like this. The other design problem is related to adaptor which is between <b>torque</b> <b>tube’s</b> tubes and tube input part. Torsion occurred on the <b>torque</b> <b>tube’s</b> tube because of the angular variation, Thus corrosion and erosion on the thread, is between tube input part and adaptor, occurred. Design of tube input part and adaptor changed because of design problem. The joint between this two parts is done shape instead of thread Finally, the finite element analysis will be repeated for the new design of <b>torque</b> <b>tube.</b> If the analysis results are suitable, the technical drawings will be updated and the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> will be produced. After the production, new <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> design will be tested because of the modifications. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the lock <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R

The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> linkages to the swash plate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement. Some UH-1Hs have been modified to replace the tail rotor control cables with <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> similar to the UH-1N Twin Huey.|$|R

5000|$|Buick {{started using}} coil springs in the 1930s {{and used the}} <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> as the main rear axle {{locating}} arm. This suspension design became a Buick [...] "engineering trademark" [...] until it was dropped with the 1961 model year full-sized models.|$|R
50|$|The {{transaxle}} {{was also}} redesigned. A <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> connected {{the engine and}} transmission, rather than allowing them to float free on the body as before.

5000|$|During the Dynaflow era, many of Buick’s unique {{engineering}} features ranked smoothness above {{most other}} design and marketing objectives.

Moreover, Buick’s <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> [...] "live axle" [...] rear suspension design, which incorporated a rigid drive shaft {{with just one}} single universal joint ("U-joint") at {{the front end of}} the driveshaft, was said to amplify the harshness of contemporary automatic shifting transmissions.
