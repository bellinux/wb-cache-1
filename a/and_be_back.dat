25|$|Lea {{combined}} {{his football}} career with {{working as a}} postman – he sometimes started work at 5.30 a.m., did an 18-mile round on foot, and then caught the 9.20 train to an away match. After the match, {{he would return to}} Chester after the last train to Wrexham had departed, so had to walk home <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> on duty next morning. By 1900, he was reckoned to have walked over 80,000 miles {{in the service of the}} Post Office.|$|E
25|$|The {{season began}} poorly for the Irish {{with a loss}} at BYU. Despite Brady Quinn {{improving}} at the quarterback position and completing over 50percent of his passes for 265yards, the Irish only managed to gain 11yards rushing. They next faced a highly ranked Michigan team at home and Willingham stated that an improved running game would be important if the Irish were {{to be able to}} beat the Wolverines. Darius Walker answered Willingham in his first collegiate game, gaining 115yards and scoring two late touchdowns to lead the Irish in the upset. The Irish were rejuvenated with this win, and they rallied to move to 3–1 on the season with wins over Michigan State and Washington. Some in the media began comparing Willingham to some of Notre Dame's legendary coaches and said the team would win seven or eight games in the season <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> in national championship contention by 2005.|$|E
500|$|In these conditions, Shackleton {{decided to}} try to reach help, using one of the boats. The nearest port was Stanley in the Falkland Islands, [...] away, but made {{unreachable}} by the prevailing westerly winds. A better option was to head for Deception Island, at the western end of the South Shetland chain. Although it was uninhabited, Admiralty records indicated that this island held stores for shipwrecked mariners, and was also visited from time to time by whalers. However, reaching it would also involve a journey against the prevailing winds—though in less open seas—with ultimately no certainty when or if rescue would arrive. After discussions with the expedition's second-in-command, Frank Wild, and ship's captain Frank Worsley, Shackleton decided to attempt to reach the whaling stations of South Georgia, to the north-east. This would mean a much longer boat journey, of [...] across the Southern Ocean, in conditions of rapidly approaching winter, but with the help of following winds it appeared feasible. Shackleton thought that [...] "a boat party might make the voyage <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> with relief within a month, provided that the sea was clear of ice, and the boat survive the great seas".|$|E
