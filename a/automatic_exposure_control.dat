50|$|The Olympus 35RC is a 35 mm {{rangefinder}} camera {{manufactured by}} Olympus in Japan in the 1970s. It {{claimed to be}} the smallest 35 mm rangefinder with <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> and manual override.|$|E
50|$|The Sharp SX862 {{features}} a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus. <b>Automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> {{and a high}} intensity LED light enable close up photography in low-light conditions. It also offers VGA quality video recording and playback.|$|E
50|$|The {{illuminance}} E {{is controlled}} by the f-number but also depends on the scene luminance. To avoid confusion, some authors (Ray 2000, 310) have used camera exposure to refer to combinations of camera settings. The 1964 ASA standard for <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>controls</b> for cameras, ASA PH2.15-1964, took the same approach, and also used the more descriptive term camera exposure settings.|$|R
25|$|From the Riga to Minox B, {{the film}} counter counts up to 50, while from Minox BL, C, to TLX, the film counter counts down from 36/30/15. For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter speed dial sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.|$|R

50|$|The glass {{lenses and}} <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> of the Nimslo made it {{well suited for}} this purpose, unlike similar cameras such as the Nishika that {{typically}} sported plastic lenses and limited adjustability, relying on the latitude of the print film to give good results under varied lighting conditions.|$|E
50|$|Current cameras do {{not allow}} direct setting of EV, and cameras with <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> {{generally}} obviate the need for it. EV can nonetheless be helpful when used to transfer recommended exposure settings from an exposure meter (or table of recommended exposures) to an exposure calculator (or table of camera settings).|$|E

30|$|CT is {{used for}} the {{assessment}} of aortic wall thickness and regularity, aortic diameter, mural calcifications and aortic branches. Bi-phasic CT is typically performed, including non-enhanced CT of the chest (40  mA, 100  kVp) [8]. The non-enhanced scan is used to exclude intramural haematoma and to show intramural calcification, particularly in cases of long-standing vasculitis. Therefore, it can be omitted in patients younger than 40  years of age. A contrast-enhanced scan of both the aorta and pulmonary arteries is typically the second step in the aortic assessment. <b>Automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> modulation <b>controlling</b> the tube current with an mA range of 200 – 500 and kilovoltage setting of 100  kVp is recommended for adequate assessment of the thoracic aorta [9]. To enhance the aorta and pulmonary arteries simultaneously, triggering at the level of left atrium is recommended with an injection rate of not less than 4  ml/s, and an overall injection of at least 100  ml of IV contrast is required [8]. ECG-gated CTA can be considered for better imaging of the ascending aorta [10]. Transverse images in conjunction with coronal, sagittal and curved reformats are helpful for assessment of the extent and severity of vessel wall involvement. CT angiography can also be used as a follow-up tool to assess the treatment response and/or activity of the disease [5].|$|R
50|$|The K1000 accepts any {{non-dedicated}} {{hot shoe}} mounted or PC terminal X-sync electronic flash for guide number manual or flash mounted sensor <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control.</b> The Vivitar 283 (guide number 120, ASA 100/feet; 37, DIN 21/meters), favoured by many photographers {{for the same}} reasons as the K1000, has an even longer life span of 1974-2004. The K1000 is also old enough to use flash bulbs, with a maximum synchronization speed of 1/30th second.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Control</b> (AEC) is an X-ray {{exposure}} termination device. A {{medical radiography}} x-ray exposure is always initiated by a human operator but an AEC detector {{system may be}} used to terminate the exposure when a predetermined amount of radiation has been received. The intention of AEC is to provide consistent x-ray image exposure, whether to film or a digital detector. AEC systems may also automatically set exposure factors such as the X-ray tube tube current and voltage.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon SB-M {{dedicated}} flash {{is designed}} specifically for the FM10, {{but it will also}} accept any other nondedicated hot shoe mounted flash for guide number manual or flash mounted sensor <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> - the venerable Vivitar 283 (guide number 120, ASA 100/feet; 37, DIN 21/meters) was still available new a quarter century after its introduction in 1975. The FM10 does not accept a motor drive; film is only advanced manually via a thumb lever.|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{curriculum}} {{strategies can}} be used to conduct an effective photography program without the expense usually associated with _a darkroom. Three methods {{can be used}} to eliminate the need for a. darkroom facility: outside vendors, an emulsion that can be user-processed without access to a darkroom (slide or transparency film), and emulsions that self-develop outside the camera (instant print film). All three strategies emphasize the picture-taking rather than the mechanical processes of producing a viewable result. If an outside vendor is used, students need instruction on how to seek out services, how to evaluate services, and how to place orders. Advantages are a wider range of services, lower costs, better quality, and time for other aspects of photography. Disadvantages may be cost, turn-around time, nd loss of control over end result. Advantages of the user-processed emulsion are the need for some darkroom experiences, reduced time, lower costs, and control over end result. Disadvantages are processing errors, variations, and no quality controls. Advantages of instant print film are immediacy, low cost, and good results. A disadvantage is that the cameras using this film are usually <b>automatic</b> for <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> and sometimes for focusing. (Resources and sources are cited.)

5000|$|... 1964: Kodak Retina Reflex IV (USA/West Germany): first SLR with {{standard}} ISO hot shoe atop the pentaprism housing for direct flash mounting and synchronization. Was a 35 mm, leaf shutter design. A flash {{is a necessary}} accessory for auxiliary or fill light in dim or high contrast conditions. The first camera {{with any kind of}} hot shoe connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO hot shoe). Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to mount flashes but a PC cable socket to sync them. The ISO hot shoe became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with <b>automatic</b> flash <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s. Note, although the hot shoe had been de facto standardized in the 1950s, the International Organization for Standardization did not promulgate its ISO 518 hot shoe specification until 1977.|$|R

50|$|The Magic, {{although}} {{intended for}} amateur photographers, was relatively expensive at 435 DM. It featured an <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> system {{driven by a}} coupled selenium light meter which could select shutter speeds from 1/30 sec to 1/300 sec and apertures from f/3.5 to f/22. There were only two manual controls: one for focusing, the other for selecting either a shutter speed of 1/30 sec (for flash photography), or Bulb (for long-exposure night photography). Its successor, the Magic II, cost 498 DM and also featured manual exposure control.|$|E
50|$|The Standard Output Sensitivity (SOS) technique, {{also new}} in the 2006 version of the standard, {{effectively}} specifies that the average level in the sRGB image must be 18% gray plus or minus 1/3 stop when the exposure is controlled by an <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> system calibrated per ISO 2721 and set to the EI with no exposure compensation. Because the output level is measured in the sRGB output from the camera, it {{is only applicable to}} sRGB images—typically JPEG—and not to output files in raw image format. It is not applicable when multi-zone metering is used.|$|E
50|$|When {{the number}} of {{photographs}} taken by astronauts during the EVAs of all Apollo missions is divided by the duration {{of all of the}} EVAs, one arrives at a figure of 1.19 photos per minute. That is one photo per 50 seconds. Discounting time spent on other activities results in one photo per 15 seconds for Apollo 11. This is even more remarkable because many places in the photographs are miles apart and would have taken considerable travel time to reach, especially in bulky pressure suits. Moreover, the cameras were equipped with neither a viewfinder nor <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control,</b> which means that taking good pictures would take considerably longer.|$|E
5000|$|As its 16mm cameras {{had been}} growing {{increasingly}} large through the addition of more features, Minolta introduced a new and much smaller model, the 16 MG, in 1966. It lacked <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure,</b> but included a light meter and match-needle that were almost as {{easy to use and}} offered the added bonus of manual <b>exposure</b> <b>control.</b> The aperture and shutter speed were set at the same time using a single [...] "exposure" [...] dial. The meter was a selenium unit, which did not require a battery and hence allowed the camera to be made smaller. The 16 MGS of 1970 was similar but used single-perforated film, which allowed the negative size to be increased and picture quality improved.|$|R

50|$|Radiation, most {{commonly}} {{in the form}} of X-rays, is used frequently in society in order to produce positive outcomes. The primary use of radiation in healthcare is in the use of radiography for radiographic examination or procedure, and in the use of radiotherapy in the treatment of cancerous conditions. Radiophobia can be a fear which patients experience before and after either of these procedures, it is therefore the responsibility of the healthcare professional at the time, often a Radiographer or Radiation Therapist, to reassure the patients about the stochastic and deterministic effects of radiation on human physiology. Advising patients and other irradiated persons of the various radiation protection measures that are enforced, including the use of lead-rubber aprons, dosimetry and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Control</b> (AEC) is a common method of informing and reassuring radiophobia sufferers.|$|E
5000|$|With Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super B, when in {{automatic}} mode, when {{changing the}} shutter speed, the camera automatically selects the right aperture {{according to the}} value indicated by the built in selenium meter needle.In the beginnings of exposure automation (ca. 1960) the instruments were even used for setting exposure settings directly, mainly for automatic aperture setting. A simple method for this was called [...] "trap-needle"; pressing the shutter release mechanically gripped the meter needle, then moved an aperture control up to hit the needle, setting the aperture to a value controlled by the meter.This kind of attempt to automate exposure setting was common in an era were precision mechanical engineers didn't know any limits of complication so that even further steps were gone to use selenium photo cells to control all exposure settings, or to control them more exactly with help of electro-mechanical aids. Heinz Waaske's SLR construction Edixa Electronica was such a costly attempt. The construction problem was the low electric power delivered by the photo cell. It was a precision mechanical wonder that a handful of cameras were made which had <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> driven by a selenium meter, without need of further electronic or electromechanical support, for example the Optima.|$|E
5000|$|Starks {{claimed that}} Nishika {{also made a}} 3 lens camera, {{but there is no}} {{evidence}} that such a camera ever existed outside his article. It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>control,</b> compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, adjustable focus with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E
