A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E

50|$|The {{strangeness of}} {{the paradox of}} {{entailment}} {{comes from the fact}} that the definition of validity in classical logic does not always agree with the use of the term in ordinary language. In everyday use validity suggests that the premises are consistent. In classical logic, the additional notion of soundness is introduced. <b>A</b> sound <b>argument</b> is <b>a</b> valid <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> all true premises. Hence <b>a</b> valid <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inconsistent set of premises can never be sound. A suggested improvement to the notion of logical validity to eliminate this paradox is relevant logic.|$|R

5|$|Ben Arfa {{was born}} into a family with a {{football}} history. His father was the former Tunisian international footballer Kamel Ben Arfa. Ben Arfa began his career in France at ASV Châtenay-Malabry. After two years at the club, he moved a few miles north to Montrouge CF 92. In 1998, Ben Arfa joined sporting club AC Boulogne-Billancourt. The following year, he was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. While at Clairefontaine, he was a part of A la Clairefontaine, a documentary series which chronicled the lives of some of France's top young footballers during their time at the academy. During the series, an episode showed Ben Arfa getting into <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> Abou Diaby. While training at Clairefontaine during the weekdays, he played for FC Versailles on the weekends.|$|E
5|$|British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{could be}} repaired within six months, and the Admiralty ordered further carrier-borne strikes against the battleship. First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham {{did not believe}} that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. The commander of the Home Fleet, Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser, initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitzs defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. Following <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> Cunningham, Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again. Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord, many of the Home Fleet's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten. This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced.|$|E
5|$|Circa 1930, Gabriel had <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> {{one of the}} Jesuits, and as {{a result}} the Mugabe family were {{expelled}} from the mission village by its French leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubiere. They settled in a village about seven miles away, although the children were permitted to remain at the mission primary school, living with relatives in Kutama during term-time and returning to their parental home at weekends. Around the same time, Robert's older brother Raphael died, likely of diarrhoea. In early 1934, Robert's other older brother, Michael, also died, after consuming poisoned maize. Later that year, Gabriel left his family in search of employment at Bulawayo. He subsequently abandoned Bona and their six children and established a relationship with another woman, with whom he had three further offspring.|$|E

5|$|Feller {{started the}} 1952 season with three wins {{in his first}} five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also allowed only one hit. Feller {{struggled}} {{for the rest of}} the season, and after <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager Al López shut Feller down for the season. He finished the season with a 9–13 record and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, beating an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 on the year, earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>with</b> the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
