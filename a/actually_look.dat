500|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 26, 1910. The film likely saw a wide national release, advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Not only are the leading roles well portrayed, but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> and act their parts. There is a pleasing, symmetrical competence in the whole cast." [...] The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement, [...] "The story ends there without a suspicion of anybody {{falling in love with}} anybody else, a restraint which will be duly appreciated." [...] Bower's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production. The previous film A Dainty Politician concluded with romance and the next release An Assisted Elopement took the romance element further with two sets of parents trying to get their children to marry each other.|$|E

2500|$|Cirque du Soleil {{utilized}} a {{new type}} of digital screen printing in order to design many costumes for Kà, examples of which {{can be seen in the}} Forest People, Archers, and the Counselor's Son. [...] The Forest People's costumes rely on printing the performers' body definitions onto the actual fabric to enhance the appearance of making their skin <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> like it is truly blue and green. [...] Inspiration was drawn from the African Maasai warriors' ritual scar markings. [...] As for the Archers, skin-toned Tactel was selected and tattoo designs were printed on it to make the Archers' tattoos look truly realistic. [...] They also have moulded rubber toes attached to their shoes, giving the appearance that they are barefoot. [...] Tattooing techniques used for the Archers were also applied to the Counselor's Son.

The web for them was always the ugly stepchild product — an afterthought — because you can't not have a website so they just got some kids to write some stuff. It was frustrating only contributing to the online product because sometimes I'd look at the traffic, which at that time the contributors could still <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> at, and I saw that some of the web-only content was doing better online than the stuff that had first appeared in the magazine ... and this always fell upon deaf ears".|$|E

The Sunday Times gave a nine star rating and said [...] "Guzaarish is a movie about hope, magic and life. Khaleej Times said [...] " [...] This wonderful work of art, nuanced and magical in its portrayal, is about dying. But Ethan, as played by Hrithik Roshan in Guzaarish, is so bemused by adversity that he can <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> at his own suffering with dispassionate humour." [...] Deccan Herald noted that only select - audience may find the movie appealing saying that [...] "the performances stand out. Hrithik Roshan does brings some tears to your eyes and even Aishwarya comes up with an original act. But, as said, the blacks and greys of Guzaarish might appeal only to Bhansali viewers." ...|$|E

Comparing the game to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions, he wrote [...] "the textures are much more clean, the rough edges are all smoothed out, and the particle lighting effects are even slightly more radiant than before." [...] GameSpy's David Hodgson scored it 3 out of 5. He was critical of the length, and that it did not improve on the PlayStation 2 version; [...] "think that the extra two months you waited for the GameCube version of the game allowed E.A. to fix the sometimes-problematic archery aiming, increase the framerate from 30, add extra polygons to the characters and foes, and tweak the water reflections so they <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> realistic? Then you're smoking more pipe-weed than the whole of Hobbiton. There are literally no differences between this, the Xbox, and the PlayStation 2 offerings." ...|$|E

2500|$|Continuing on {{the idea}} from the {{previous}} Marvel Netflix series that New York City is a [...] "fifth Defender", Loeb said the series would examine the high-end financial world of New York City, examining [...] "the One Percent of the One Percent and how that affects our world on a day-to-day basis... high-level corporation, Big Pharma, things like that". Jones added the series examined [...] "corporate corruption and corporate responsibility in the modern world, and... ow much do corporations have impact on society? And what we <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> at in the show is the heroin epidemic of the city, and how corporations maybe actually fund the heroin epidemic, {{and what that means}} to society". In terms of Rand donning a comic-based costume in the season, Buck stated, [...] "There was no good reason we could imagine to put Danny Rand in a costume. Because Danny Rand is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be, so he’s not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume. t the same time he is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can’t necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized. It does become an issue for the character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of the {{graphics}} were also mixed. AllGame's J.C. Barnes was critical, writing, [...] "pop in is extremely widespread in dungeons and towns. Also dungeon textures are bland and repetitive." [...] Game Revolution's Johnny Liu wrote [...] "Graphically, Dark Cloud is colorful if a bit bland. It simply {{looks like a}} first generation game." [...] On the other hand, Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote [...] "All of the models, effects, and textures are sumptuous." [...] IGN's Dave Zydrko was more ambivalent; [...] "Dark Cloud isn't a bad-looking game by any means. The character models <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> really good, completely with jag-free edges, lots of texture detail and really cool designs [...] What hurts Dark Cloud is its background graphics. There's a lot of flickering in the backgrounds, plus clipping problems can be found, there are some instances where you'll see seams in the textures, and the background textures are poorly designed in that they look like floor and wall tiles in the outside environments." [...] GameSpot's Shane Satterfield had similarly mixed views; [...] "Dark Clouds graphics can be both stunning and disappointing. All six characters look great, and it's obvious that {{a great deal of}} time was taken in crafting their personalities through animation [...] Graphical tricks like real-time shadows, depth blur, and particle effects are prevalent in most settings." [...] However, he also felt, [...] "By the third stage of each dungeon, things become undeniably monotonous due to constantly reused textures and objects. Other graphical problems include flickering textures and a camera that regularly gets stuck behind objects while your character is locked on to an enemy." ...|$|E

So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to <b>actually</b> <b>look</b> at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

There is a consensus that with [...] "its third season, the show has morphed into a stinging allegorical critique of America’s three-year occupation of Iraq" [...] as the [...] "cameras record Cylon occupation raids on unsuspecting human civilians with the night-vision green familiar to any TV news viewer. The reasoning of the Cylons is horrifically familiar, they would prefer not to be brutal but they won't accept the failure of a glorious mission."

[...] The [...] "really audacious stroke of this season was showing us a story about a suicide bomber {{from the point of view}} of the bomber and his comrades... because the cause of this terrorist was unquestioningly our own. We sympathize with the insurgents wholeheartedly."
