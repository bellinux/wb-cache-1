40|$|Multi-bit sigma-delta based {{digital pulse}} width {{modulators}} (DPWM) {{are used in}} the control of DC-DC converters in order to achieve high resolution and therefore high output voltage accuracy at switching frequencies up to multiple MHz. The standard sigma-delta modulators which have mainly been used in these DPWMs to date generate idle tones in the <b>applied</b> <b>duty</b> cycle which result in large oscillations in the output voltage. A dithered sigma-delta modulator is instead implemented here which eliminates these oscillations in the output voltage by adding a random signal before the quantizer in the sigma-delta modulator. The power spectral density of the duty cycle produced by the dithered sigma-delta modulator based DPWM shows a reduction in the undesirable idle tones and this is also verified experimentally using a buck converter prototype.

40|$|Manganese dioxide {{samples were}} {{prepared}} by pulse current electrodeposition. The {{effects of the}} pulse current parameters {{on the type of}} hysteresis loop of the adsorption isotherms, the surface area, and nano-structure morphology of the samples were investigated in details by using the Barrett–Joyner– Halenda (BJH) method and the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique. Results indicate that the <b>applied</b> <b>duty</b> cycles play key roles in different characteristics of the samples. Samples obtained at duty cycles up to 30 % show a decreasing trend of the surface area as well as increasing grain size and represent a type H 4 hysteresis as duty cycles decrease. At duty cycle of 30 %, the surface area has been increased, whereas at higher duty cycle of 70 %, a decrease in surface area and the grain size of samples has been observed. Even though type H 2 hysteresis prevailed at duty cycles higher than 70 %, an overlapping of both type H 4 and H 2 hysteresis loops were obtained at duty cycles lower than 70 %. These behaviors were explained and discussed {{on the basis of the}} formation and dissolution mechanism of the passive layers during on- and off-times...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} introduced semi-quasi-Z-source in- verter {{can be interpreted}} as a DC-DC converter whose input- output voltage gain may take any value between minus infinity and 1 depending on the <b>applied</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. In order to generate a sinusoidal voltage waveform at the output of this converter, a time-varying duty cycle needs to be applied. Application of a time-varying duty cycle that produces large-signal behavior requires careful consideration of stability issues. This paper provides stability results for both the large-signal averaged and the switched models of the semi-quasi-Z-source inverter operating in continuous conduction mode. We show that if the load is linear and purely resistive then the boundedness and ultimate boundedness of the state trajectories is guaranteed provided some reasonable operation conditions are ensured. These conditions amount to keeping the duty cycle away from the extreme values 0 or 1 (averaged and switched models), and limiting the maximum PWM switching period (switched model). The results obtained can be used to give theoretical justification to the inverter operation strategy recently proposed by Cao et al. in [1].

40|$|ABSTRACT Relating the {{collected}} customs {{duty to the}} value of imports enables the estimation of a rate of <b>applied</b> <b>duty</b> that takes into account all pricing components and their use. Indeed, this ad valorem equivalent integrates the complex dimensions of customs duties, the measures of exemption and suspension, and those concerning preferential regimes. Processing collected duties for all the products reveals that the 1. 5 per cent rate of duty actually applied in 2003 is the same for the EU and the US. Nevertheless, it appears that the US taxes more the least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries than does the EU. Thus, setting aside those products which enter free of duty, the rate of taxation applied by the US is 15 per cent and 6. 2 per cent respectively with regards to LDCs and developing countries, whereas in the EU it is only 3. 7 per cent and 4. 1 per cent. In the US market the sectors that are the most highly taxed upon importation are textiles, apparel and clothing, cotton and articles of leather, whereas in the EU it is more agricultural and food products (fruits and preserves, meats, sugars and cereals).

40|$|Anti-dumping duties, {{safeguards}} and countervailing duties are collectively, {{within the}} context of the WTO, referred to as „trade remedies. ‟ More specifically, the imposition of anti-dumping duties is a remedial measure for dealing with imports that cause or threatens to cause injury to local producers. Under the WTO framework, Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on the Implementation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 provides the rules for <b>applying</b> anti-dumping <b>duties</b> by member countries. Nigeria has been a member of the WTO since 1995 and can only <b>apply</b> anti-dumping <b>duties</b> provided it adheres to the rules governing anti-dumping.
