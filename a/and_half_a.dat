5|$|Bentworth was {{the largest}} parish within the Hundred of Odiham, after Odiham itself. At {{the time of the}} Domesday Survey the area of the Hundred of Odiham were {{included}} in two separate hundreds, Odiham and Hefedele (also known as Edefele and Efedele). The former comprised Lasham and Shalden <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> hide which had been taken from the nearby village of Preston Candover, and the latter included Odiham, Winchfield, Elvetham, Dogmersfield, and a former parish named Berchelei. For the manors of Bentworth, Greywell, Hartley Wintney, Liss, Sherfield-upon-Loddon, and Weston Patrick, there are no entries in the Survey, but they were believed to have been included in the large manor of Odiham.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock was {{retired to}} stud, {{where he became}} a {{successful}} stallion. He first stood at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire, with his fee initially set at 15 guineas <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> guinea for the groom (Thomas Barrow). He was then leased to Thomas Kirkby in York for four seasons where he stood for a much lower fee. In 1827 he was at Bildeston in Suffolk and was commanding a stud fee of twelve guineas. His fee reached up to 25 guineas.|$|E

5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to higher elevations. Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile from the San Joaquin River.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Light {{was brought}} back to {{a mile and a}} quarter, and {{produced}} placed efforts on his next two starts. At Royal Ascot in June, he was beaten a head by Lear Spear in the Prince of Wales's Stakes (then a Group Two race), and at Sandown three weeks later he finished third, beaten a neck <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> length behind Compton Admiral and Xaar in the Group One Eclipse Stakes.|$|E
5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E

5|$|For {{short-range}} missile (throwing) weapons, a Roman infantryman {{would probably}} had either a long throwing-spear {{or two or}} three short javelins (lanceae) <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> dozen plumbatae (weighted darts) with an effective range of about 30m. Ammianus talks of a variety of missiles being thrown by the Alamanni in the battle: spicula (a kind of long pilum-type javelin, also known as an angon), verruta missilia (short throwing-spears) and ferratae arundines (probably darts and franciscas: throwing-axes). Overall, there appears little difference in the throwing-missile capability of the contenders. Ammianus indicates that the Roman infantry ranks were obliged to hold their shields above their heads for much of the time due to the volume of missiles raining down on them.|$|E
5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took three months <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> {{million dollars to}} construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of}} the largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, chief {{architect}} and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, surveyed {{the area and}} introduced the local Portland stone to London; using it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for repairs on St Paul's Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War {{hundreds of thousands of}} gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the Western Front. Portland cement {{has nothing to do with}} Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.|$|E

5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
5|$|The first French {{units to}} come under attack were those {{officers}} accompanying the local gendarmerie or standing guard. The contingents of the French garrison at Marash, numbering only 2,000 men, were separated from {{one another in the}} citywide siege. Direct communications did not exist between Marash and division headquarters and General Dufieux was only informed of the insurrection on 31 January, after several Armenians from the French Armenian Legion managed to disguise themselves as Muslims and cross the battle lines. He immediately appointed Lieutenant Colonel Robert Normand to lead a relief expedition, composed of three infantry battalions <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> squadron of cavalry, to Marash, and dispatched aerial recon flights, giving hope to the besieged French, Armenians and American relief workers who were assisting the local population.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} curriculum, {{there are no}} {{references}} to sports being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use an acre of land, which probably functioned as a playground. Sports fields were not added to the grounds until 1908, but the earliest reports of the school participating in sporting events pre-date this by half a century. In the 1860s, the Sleaford Gazette reported on cricket matches with local schools, namely the rival academies run by Mr Boyer and Mr Dibben in Sleaford; by the 1890s, these matches were being organised with more distant schools, like the grammar school at Grantham. Athletics were practised at the school as early as 1871 when a sports day was held; the 100 yards <b>and</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile races, hurdles, the pole jump and throwing the cricket ball were activities in which forms competed. Football was played at the school as early as 1895. Glebe land was acquired in 1908 for sporting purposes and levelled in the early 1930s. A cycling club was formed in the 1940s and badminton was informally organised by pupils by the 1950s; between 1957 and 1960, a portion of land was converted into tennis courts for the school and rugby {{was introduced in the}} 1966–67 academic year.|$|E
