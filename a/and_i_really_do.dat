2500|$|Isis {{were the}} opening act for Tool's late 2006 North American tour {{in support of}} their new album, 10,000 Days. This led to {{increased}} exposure for the band; however, the band members are not particularly comfortable with fame, and tend to keep their affairs private. Turner has stated that [...] "We never imagined that Isis would become as successful or as popular as it has", and confesses: [...] " [...] taking a deeply personal interest in who I am, it fucking freaks me out. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> feel like sometimes when I get approached, I'm retreating into my shell." ...|$|E

6000|$|HYPATIA. Well, papa, youve never shewn any {{delicacy}} {{in talking}} to me about my conduct; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>dont</b> see why <b>I</b> shouldnt talk to you about yours. It's such nonsense! Do you think young people dont know? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! Harry said he {{had gone}} geology mad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> get you a bit of {{something}} at Vale Leston, Fergus, that Mr. Harewood said was worth having. Was it an encrinite? I {{know it was a}} stone-lily.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Jacinta. [...] "Still, I didn't {{mean you}} to let him see that <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not kick you very hard. Any way, it doesn't matter. The great thing {{is that he is}} gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is right, Dicky. If we {{win this}} {{campaign}} I will certainly ask {{for you as}} adjutant. I shall be awfully {{glad to have you}} with me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> want an adjutant for each battalion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I said poor,' now put in Lady Merrifield, 'it {{was not so}} {{much that}} I was {{thinking}} of her death as of her having come into a family where nobody welcomed her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not suppose it was her fault.' ...|$|E

60|$|HYPATIA. Even {{if there}} wasnt any Bentley: {{even if you}} didnt care (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>dont</b> see why you should care so much) still, we never could be on {{conventional}} terms with one another again. Besides, Ive got a feeling for you: almost a ghastly sort of love for you.|$|R
5000|$|Horse Rotorvator {{was this}} vision I'd had of this mechanical/flesh thing that {{ploughed}} up the earth <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> {{have a vision}} of it - a real horrible, burning, dripping, jaw-like vision in the night ... The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse killed their horses and use their jawbones to make this huge earth-moving machine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was diff'runt," [...] {{she said}} defiantly. [...] "I knew you wouldn't believe them yarns <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't intend you to. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> see {{something}} queer {{one night when}} I was passing the over-harbour graveyard, true's you live. I dunno whether 'twas a ghost or Sandy Crawford's old white nag, but it looked blamed queer <b>and</b> <b>I</b> tell you I scooted {{at the rate of}} no man's business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Whimple," [...] said Herbert, when I {{told him}} so, [...] "is {{the best of}} housewives, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no {{relation}} {{in the world but}} old Gruffandgrim." ...|$|E

"Now, Barb'ry Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "if you're thinkin' of shovelin' {{your way}} {{from this place}} to where your cows is, you'd better step right out and get at it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> {{think that if you}} felt they were sufferin' for want of milkin' you'd make a start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jeff," [...] he said, {{turning away}} slowly, with a sigh, and limping {{back to his}} couch, [...] "there's room for improvement. I thought myself not a bad-looking fellow once.

5000|$|A {{director}} called Michael Gracey did the video. When {{he presented}} {{the idea to}} me, I was won over straight away. I always had a thing for Jane Fonda in Barbarella! She was my inspiration when we were shooting the video <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> get into character. I'm sure you'll see a bit more dancing from me—though I'm not sure you'd call it dancing, more bopping and jolting! ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{the tour}} {{documentary}} And All That Could Have Been was released featuring performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour. While making the DVD, Reznor {{commented on the}} tour in retrospect by saying [...] "I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it", but later wrote that [...] "I cant watch it at all. I was sick for most of that tour <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>dont</b> think it was Nine Inch Nails at its best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was I, sir," [...] Frank said {{rising in}} his place; [...] "I {{was there with}} Goodall. We ran on Mr. Gregson's ground after a butterfly. It was my fault, sir, for, of course, Goodall went where I did. We ran among his wheat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not notice {{where we were going}} till he called to us. I was wrong, of course, and am ready to pay for any damage we may have caused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. If they {{detected}} him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not {{see that}} there is a chance of their doing so, disguised as he was, they would have seized him and probably killed him, but there would be no firing. He has gone unarmed, you know, and would offer no resistance. Those shots you heard were doubtless the result of some drunken quarrel over the loot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are {{thinking}} of Miss Conway,' said Louis, blushing, but with curious naivete. 'Well, I have been thinking of that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not believe there was anything in it. I did make myself rather a fool at Beauchastel, and Jem would have made me a greater one; but you know my father {{put a stop to}} it. Thinking her handsomer than other people can't be love, can it?' ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{drafted the}} first part of Chapter VI., Fleeming and his friends, his {{influence}} on me, his views on religion and literature, his part at the Savile; it should boil down to about ten pages, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> think it admirably good. It has so much evoked Fleeming for myself that I found my conscience stirred just {{as it used to be}} after a serious talk with him: surely that means it is good? I had to write and tell you, being alone.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JUNO [thoughtfully] I don't {{know what}} to say. I must think over it. I have always been rather severe on this sort of thing; {{but when it came}} to the point I didn't behave as I thought I should behave. I didn't intend to be wicked; but somehow or other, Nature, or {{whatever}} you choose to call it, didn't take much notice of my intentions. [Gregory instinctively seeks her hand and presses it]. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> think, Tops, that I was the only woman in the world for you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I woon't, I woon't, mom! Oh, glory--Oh, I didn't {{mean to say}} it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't, <b>really,</b> <b>did</b> <b>I?</b> But I'm so glad, and Benny'll be, too! Can I {{tell him}} now? To-night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] said Mr. Chipperton, [...] "I had a bite {{just at that}} minute; <b>and,</b> besides, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> {{not look}} for you on such a little boat. I had an idea you would come on {{something}} more respectable than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Mrs Loper," [...] said Mrs Twitter over {{a cup of}} tea, [...] "it is {{very kind}} of you to say so, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> think you are right, we have done full justice to our dear wee Mita. Who would ever have thought, remembering the thin starved sickly child she was the night that Sam brought her in, that she would come to be such a plump, rosy, lovely child? I declare to you that I feel as if she were one of my own." ...|$|E
6000|$|That's all. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not see why poor Mr. Asquith {{should be}} {{represented}} as having violated the Christian virtue of mercy by saying that. I myself could compose {{a great many}} paragraphs upon the same model, each containing its stinging and perhaps unscrupulous epigram. As, for example:--"The Archbishop of Canterbury, realising that his choice now lay between denying God and earning the crown of martyrdom by dying in torments, spoke with a frenzy of religious passion that might have seemed fanatical under circumstances less intense. 'The Children's Service,' he said firmly, with {{his face to the}} congregation, 'will be held at half-past four this afternoon as usual.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; just a last flutter." [...] All {{this had}} been said with such a mixture of {{indifferent}} badinage on his part, and of serious anger on hers, that Mrs. Holt, who saw it all and understood it, sat very uneasy in her chair. [...] "To tell the truth," [...] continued he, [...] "all the instructions {{have been given to}} the lawyers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> think that I had better be away during the making of the dresses and the baking of the cake. It has come to pass by this accident of my living at the Deanery that we have already become almost tired of each other's company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, William,' {{returned}} Emily, {{with many}} tears, 'it is my most earnest {{wish to make}} him comfortable. Thank {{you for what you}} have said. Now that I am stronger, I hope to <b>do</b> more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>really</b> <b>do</b> my best.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know all}} about it," [...] she added, aloud. [...] "It is not 'the devil,' as you call it, but the very natural desire of all young people for liberty. I used to feel just so, <b>and</b> once, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> think {{for a minute that}} I would bolt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Joe Klein refuted {{the charges}} of anti-Semitism in his reply, stating that he was [...] "anti-neoconservative".Listen, people can vote {{whichever}} way they want, for whatever reason they want. I just don't want to see policy makers who make decisions {{on the basis of}} whether American policy will benefit Israel or not. In some cases, you want to provide protection for Israel certainly, but you don't want {{to go to war with}} Iran. When Jennifer Rubin or Abe Foxman calls me antisemitic, they're wrong. I am anti-neoconservative. I think these people are following very perversely extremist policies <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> believe that it was time for mainstream Jews to stand up and say, [...] "They don't represent us, they don't represent Israel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'George Sarawia will (D.V.) {{start with}} a little company of Christian friends at his own island. The {{scholars}} from all the different islands fraternise excellently well, {{and in many cases}} the older and more advanced have their regular chums, by private arrangement among themselves, whom they help, and to whose islands they are quite prepared to be sent, if I think fit so to arrange; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> believe that from the Banks Islands we may send out missionaries to many of the Melanesian islands, as from Samoa and Karotonga they have gone out to the islands of the Eastern Pacific. Humanly speaking, I see no difficulty in our drawing into our central school here any number of natives that we can support, from the New Hebrides, Banks and Solomon Islands, and I trust soon from the Santa Cruz Islands also.|$|E
6000|$|... "There! I've {{poured it}} all out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> feel a little better just for the moment. It won't last, of course, but even a minute is something. Ginger, dear, I shan't see you for ever so long, even if we ever do meet again, but you'll try to {{remember}} that I'm thinking of you a whole lot, won't you? I feel responsible for you. You're my baby. You've got started now and you've only to stick to it. Please, please, please don't 'make a hash of it'! Good-bye. I never did find that photograph of me that {{we were looking for}} that afternoon in the apartment, or I would send it to you. Then you could have kept it on your mantelpiece, and whenever you felt inclined to make a hash of anything I would have caught your eye sternly and you would have pulled up.|$|E
60|$|When strikes were {{splitting}} England {{right and}} left a little while ago, an ingenious writer, humorously describing himself as a Liberal, {{said that they were}} entirely due to the hot weather. The suggestion was eagerly taken up by other creatures of the same kind, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>do</b> not see why it was not carried farther and applied to other lamentable uprisings in history. Thus, it is a remarkable fact that the weather is generally rather warm in Egypt; and this cannot but throw a light on the sudden and mysterious impulse of the Israelites to escape from captivity. The English strikers used some barren republican formula (arid as the definitions of the medieval schoolmen), some academic shibboleth about being free men and not being forced to work except for a wage accepted by them. Just in the same way the Israelites in Egypt employed some dry scholastic quibble about the extreme difficulty of making bricks with nothing to make them of. But whatever fantastic intellectual excuses they may have put forward for their strange and unnatural conduct in walking out when the prison door was open, {{there can be no doubt}} that the real cause was the warm weather. Such a climate notoriously also produces delusions and horrible fancies, such as Mr. Kipling describes. And it was while their brains were disordered by the heat that the Jews fancied that they were founding a nation, that they were led by a prophet, and, in short, that they were going to be of some importance in the affairs of the world.|$|E

I am not at all a superstitious man, or one given to vain imaginings, but I am sure that Savage <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> see <b>and</b> hear the spirit or the shadow of my wife. Her body {{it could not have}} been as you will admit, though how she could utter, or seem to utter, audible speech without one is more than I can tell. Also I am sure that she is captive upon yonder mountain and came to call me to rescue her. Under these circumstances I feel that it is my duty, as well as my desire, to give up any idea of leaving the country and try to find out the truth." ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1940s, with {{hopes of}} {{spending}} more time on her art, Schinasi moved west to Los Angeles first expanding and finally selling her eyeglass concern. The move away from her business and New York allowed for {{a new level of}} commitment to her art. Having begun studies with Howard Warshaw at Jepson School of Art in Los Angeles. Schinasi said, “I took a room in the house as my studio and put a sign on the door: ‘Do not come in unless there’s a catastrophe. I wanted to have three hours a day just to myself without interruption, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> work very hard.’” Altina began to paint in earnest and her large paintings were selected for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) juried show. In Los Angeles, Altina spent many years as a volunteer art therapist and muralist at experimental mental health center, Synanon.|$|R
