5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While {{the procedure is}} inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which functions {{in the same manner}} is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs <b>and</b> <b>blocks.</b> These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E

Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass seed to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|Triple-doubles in NCAA tournament history: The NCAA began {{keeping track}} of assists for men's {{basketball}} in 1984, then blocks and steals in 1986, so officially this has occurred eight times.

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods <b>and</b> <b>blocks,</b> explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E

5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E

Consisting of 1.8 million bricks <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the Main stand was opened on 9 September 2016, {{making it one of}} the largest all-seater single stands in European football and took the overall capacity to 54,074.|$|E

5|$|Since inhibitors {{modulate}} {{the function}} of enzymes they are often used as drugs. Many such drugs are reversible competitive inhibitors that resemble the enzyme's native substrate, similar to methotrexate above; other well-known examples include statins used to treat high cholesterol, and protease inhibitors used to treat retroviral infections such as HIV. A common example of an irreversible inhibitor that {{is used as a}} drug is aspirin, which inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes that produce the inflammation messenger prostaglandin. Other enzyme inhibitors are poisons. For example, the poison cyanide is an irreversible enzyme inhibitor that combines with the copper and iron in the active site of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> cellular respiration.|$|E

Tens of thousands of people kneel to greet the first rays of light as the sun rises above the horizon. The main event for the Church is carried out by ukukus, who climb glaciers over Qullqipunku and bring back crosses <b>and</b> <b>blocks</b> of ice to place along the road to the shrine.
