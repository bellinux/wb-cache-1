25|$|In February 2002, Roche's patents for {{isotretinoin}} expired, {{and there}} are now many other companies selling cheaper generic versions of the drug. On June 29, 2009, Roche Pharmaceuticals, the original creator and distributor of isotretinoin, officially discontinued both the manufacture and distribution of their <b>Accutane</b> brand in the United States due to what the company described as business reasons related to low market share (below 5%), coupled with {{the high cost of}} defending personal-injury lawsuits brought by some patients prescribed the drug. Generic isotretinoin will remain available in the United States through various manufacturers. Roche USA continues to defend <b>Accutane</b> and claims to have treated over 13 million patients since its introduction in 1982. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. apparently will continue to manufacture and distribute Roaccutane outside of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Oral Isotretinoin is best absorbed {{when taken}} with a high-fat meal, {{because it has a}} high level of lipophilicity. The {{efficacy}} of isotretinoin doubles when taken after a high-fat meal compared to when taken without food. Due to Isotretinoin's molecular relationship to Vitamin A, it should not be taken with Vitamin A supplements due to the danger of toxicity through cumulative overdosing. <b>Accutane</b> also negatively interacts with tetracycline, another class of acne drug, and with micro-dosed ('mini-pill') progesterone preparations, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol ('OrthoNovum 7/7/7'), St. John's Wort, phenytoin, and systemic corticosteroids.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin, {{also known}} as 13-cis-retinoic acid (and colloquially {{referred}} to by its former brand name <b>Accutane),</b> is a medication primarily used to treat severe acne. Rarely, it {{is also used to}} prevent certain skin cancers (squamous-cell carcinoma), and in the treatment of other cancers. It is used to treat harlequin-type ichthyosis, a usually lethal skin disease, and lamellar ichthyosis. It is a retinoid, meaning it is related to vitamin A, and is found in small quantities naturally in the body. Its isomer, tretinoin, is also an acne drug.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of acne, the most prescribed retinoid drug is 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin). It reduces the size and secretion of the sebaceous glands. Although {{it is known that}} 40mg of isotretinoin will break down to an equivalent of 10mg of ATRA— the mechanism of action of the drug (original brand name <b>Accutane)</b> remains unknown and is a matter of some controversy. Isotretinoin reduces bacterial numbers in both the ducts and skin surface. This is thought to be a result of the reduction in sebum, a nutrient source for the bacteria. Isotretinoin reduces inflammation via inhibition of chemotactic responses of monocytes and neutrophils. Isotretinoin also has been shown to initiate remodeling of the sebaceous glands; triggering changes in gene expression that selectively induce apoptosis. Isotretinoin is a teratogen with a number of potential side-effects. Consequently, its use requires medical supervision.|$|E

500|$|The {{approach}} to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century. Retinoids were introduced {{as a medical}} treatment for acne in 1943. Benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and has been routinely {{used for this purpose}} since the 1960s. Acne treatment was modified in the 1950s with the introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as minocycline). These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin {{plays an important role in}} causing acne. Subsequently, in the 1970s tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. The [...] development of oral isotretinoin (sold as <b>Accutane</b> and Roaccutane) followed in 1980. After its introduction in the United States it was recognized as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. About 160babies were born with birth defects.|$|E
2500|$|Isotretinoin {{was first}} marketed as <b>Accutane</b> by Hoffmann-La Roche. It sold well for many years, but in 2009, Roche decided to remove <b>Accutane</b> from the US market after juries had awarded {{millions}} of dollars in damages to former <b>Accutane</b> users over inflammatory bowel disease claims. [...] The American College of Gastroenterologists have released a position paper stating that patients with inflammatory bowel disease should not be precluded from having their acne treated with isotretinoin. [...] It then became generic and as of 2017 was marketed under many brand names worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|All retinoid {{forms of}} vitamin A {{are used in}} {{cosmetic}} and medical applications applied to the skin.

2500|$|Bishop's mother filed a $70 million (2002 USD) {{lawsuit against}} Roche Laboratories, who makes an acne {{medicine}} called <b>Accutane.</b> According to the lawsuit claim the medicine had side effects {{such as depression}} and suicidal actions, which the claim stated {{as the cause of}} the incident. [...] The suit was dropped on June 26, 2007, by Bishop's mother, who stated she was physically and emotionally unable to continue the action.|$|E
2500|$|A CDC report {{published}} in 2000 showed {{problems with the}} Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed {{that the increase in}} prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the [...] "Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program" [...] and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken. [...] In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage <b>Accutane</b> Related Teratogenicity) that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give patients after they have confirmed a negative pregnancy test; prescriptions could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{reports and}} studies criticizing the drug’s {{negative}} side effects have been published over the years, with strong language both for and against use of the medication. The author of a 2002 paper from Harvard Law School wrote: “Accutane also {{has the potential to}} destroy lives. <b>Accutane</b> is an extremely dangerous teratogen: It can cause severe birth defects when taken during pregnancy. About one quarter of babies born who have been exposed to <b>Accutane</b> during gestation have major congenital deformities. Those babies born without major malformations frequently develop severe learning disabilities. A whole segment of <b>Accutane</b> babies do not even survive pregnancy: 40% are spontaneously miscarried.” The author goes on to compare <b>Accutane</b> to Thalidomide.|$|E

[...] He asserted that these injuries had derailed his acting career. Stars Martin Sheen (a longtime family friend), Brian Dennehy, Esai Morales and Rob Reiner (Marshall's director on A Few Good Men) were to testify on his behalf.

50|$|Severe acne usually {{indicates}} {{the necessity of}} prescription medication to treat the pimples. Prescription medications used to treat acne and pimples include isotretinoin, which is a retinoid. Historically, antibiotics such as tetracyclines and erythromycin were prescribed. While they were more effective than topical applications of benzoyl peroxide, the bacteria eventually grew resistant to the antibiotics and the treatments became less and less effective. Also, antibiotics had more side effects than topical applications, such as stomach cramps and severe discoloration of teeth. Common antibiotics prescribed by dermatologists include doxycycline and minocycline. For more severe cases of acne dermatologists might recommend <b>accutane,</b> a retinoid {{that is the most}} potent of acne treatments. However, <b>accutane</b> can cause various side effects including vomiting, diarrhea, and birth defects if taken during pregnancy.|$|E

50|$|The iPLEDGE Program (an FDA-mandated REMS Program - see below) {{was instituted}} by the FDA on March 1, 2006 as a {{replacement}} for the failed SMART program (System to Manage <b>Accutane</b> Related Teratogenicity). Instituted in April 2002, SMART aimed to eliminate isotretinoin-induced birth defects by preventing pregnant women from being prescribed or exposed to the drug. The program mandated two consecutive negative pregnancy tests, birth defect risk counseling and a pledge to use two forms of contraception when engaging in intercourse for all women of childbearing age seeking an isotretinoin prescription. A voluntary registration program called The <b>Accutane</b> Survey was also established. However, no effort was made to verify the compliance of doctors and pharmacists, {{only a small percentage of}} women registered in the survey, and isotretinoin's reputation as an acne wonder drug continued to fuel demand for new prescriptions, an increasing number of which were being written and dispensed for relatively minor cases of acne vulgaris without proper screening, supervision or evidence that less risky medications had first been attempted.|$|E
50|$|Some retinol dehydrogenases are in extra-ocular tissues, such {{as human}} retinol dehydrogenase-4 (RoDH-4), which {{converts}} retinol and 1-cis-retinol to different aldehydes in liver and skin. It {{was also found}} that 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin), 3,4-didehydroretinoic acid, and 3,4-didehydroretinol can act as competitive inhibitor of the 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase oxidative activity of the enzyme. This can potentially explain how isotretinoin, the active ingredient is Roaccutane (<b>Accutane),</b> can suppress sebaceous glands and be used for severe acne treatment.|$|E
50|$|Microtia is a {{congenital}} deformity where the pinna (external ear) is underdeveloped. A completely undeveloped pinna {{is referred to}} as anotia. Because microtia and anotia have the same origin, it can be referred to as microtia-anotia. Microtia can be unilateral (one side only) or bilateral (affecting both sides). Microtia occurs in 1 out of about 8,000-10,000 births. In unilateral microtia, the right ear is most commonly affected. It may occur as a complication of taking <b>Accutane</b> (isotretinoin) during pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the goal}} of the program is to prevent pregnancies, male {{patients}} must also participate, primarily due to fears that male isotretinoin users might share their prescriptions with females without their physicians' knowledge.
