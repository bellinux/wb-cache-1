5|$|At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to {{the north}} of the emplaced positions, acting as a {{diversion}} while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's diversion distracted the Arab defenders, but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings in their path, which created <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> of smoke under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace.|$|E
5|$|During Bieksa's tenure {{with both}} the Manitoba Moose and Vancouver Canucks, he became close friends with {{teammate}} Rick Rypien, who committed suicide in August 2011 after years of clinical depression. Bieksa was the first Canucks teammate that Rypien confided in regarding his mental health; when Rypien took his first personal {{leave of absence from}} the Canucks in the 2008–09 NHL season, Bieksa took him into his home to live with his family. Having a close relationship with Rypien, Bieksa was involved in many of the ceremonies following his death. He was <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> bearer for Rypien's casket at his funeral in Alberta and he later presented Rypien's family with one of the forward's game-worn Canucks jerseys during the team's pre-game ceremony in Rypien's honour in October 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{was compounded by}} diseases impacting the wine and silk industries French capital accumulation and foreign investment plummeted to the lowest levels experienced by France {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century. After a boom in new investment banks after the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the destruction of the French banking industry wrought by the crash cast <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> over the financial sector that lasted until the dawn of the 20th century. French finances were further sunk by failing investments abroad, principally in railroads and buildings. The French net national product declined over the ten years from 1882 to 1892.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, the Parapsychological Association {{was formed}} as the preeminent society for parapsychologists. In 1969, they became {{affiliated}} with the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Criticisms of the field were focused in {{the founding of the}} Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (1976), now called the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and its periodical, Skeptical Inquirer. Eventually, more mainstream scientists became critical of parapsychology as an endeavor, and statements by the National Academies of Science and the National Science Foundation cast <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> on the claims of evidence for parapsychology. Today, many cite parapsychology {{as an example of a}} pseudoscience. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research.|$|E

The blast wave ripped into the crowds of people who had run into Donegall Street for safety, tossing them in all directions and killing another four men outright: three of them, Ernest Dougan (39), James Macklin (30) and Samuel Trainor (39) were corporation binmen working in the area, and the fourth man was Sydney Bell (65). Trainor was also an off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier {{and a member of the}} Orange Order. A seriously wounded pensioner, Henry Miller (79) would die in hospital on 5 April. Most of the bodies of the dead were mutilated beyond recognition; one of the binmen lay in the road with his head shattered. With the exception of Constable O'Neill, who had been a Catholic, the other six victims were Protestants.|$|E
25|$|Alexander and Maria were crowned at the Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow on 27 May 1883. Just {{before the}} coronation, a major {{conspiracy}} had been uncovered, which cast <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> over the celebration. Nevertheless, over 8000 guests attended the splendid ceremony. Because {{of the many}} threats against Maria and Alexander III, {{the head of the}} security police, General Cherevin, shortly after the coronation urged the Tsar and his family to relocate to Gatchina Palace, a more secure location 50 kilometres outside St. Petersburg. The huge palace had 900 rooms and was built by Catherine the Great. The Romanovs heeded the advice. Maria and Alexander III lived at Gatchina for 13 years, and it was here that their five surviving children grew up. Under heavy guard, Alexander III and Maria made periodic trips from Gatchina to the capital to take part in official events.|$|E
25|$|Ben Ami's {{assessment}} was correct. On July 27 an official radio announcement said the High Commissioner, Alan Cunningham {{had given the}} order {{to carry out the}} executions, which were scheduled for July 29. The superintendent of Acre Prison, Major G.E.G. Charlton, refused to preside over the executions {{due to the fact that}} they were to be carried out in secret, rather than in the traditional way, with the execution date announced well in advance and the families of the condemned allowed to visit them prior to the event. He was subsequently relieved of his position. The Inspector of Prisons, Mr. Hackett, was appointed superintendent in his place, and he along with Andrew Clow, the superintendent of Nablus jail, would serve as the chief hangmen. On July 28, it was announced that the three would die the following day. The announcement cast <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> over the Yishuv. The Jewish Agency and Palestine's Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Herzog made last-ditch appeals for the lives of the men to be spared, but to no avail. The Irgun immediately reiterated its warning that the hostages would also die in response. British forces carried out unsuccessful, last-ditch searches in Jerusalem, Kfar Saba, and Ness Ziona for the two sergeants.|$|E

As an additional note Buckner paid for then Captain Grant's lodging in New York City after the Mexican War when Grant was destitute. Also Buckner acted as <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> bearer and paid for Grant's funeral and provided Grant's widow a financial monthly payment so she could live out her years. The surrender was a humiliation for Buckner personally, but also a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000men and much equipment, as well as control of the Cumberland River, {{which led to the}} evacuation of Nashville.|$|E

500|$|Mac {{experiences}} {{his spiritual}} resurrection {{even as he}} wrestles with death, in both the past—Sonny's father in the Vietnam War—and present—his own daughter in a car accident.

Leonard writes of this resurrection, [...] "Depression hangs like <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> over Tender Mercies [...] what makes this film inspiring is that it is also about the joy of being found.... Mac finds the way, the truth, and the life he wants." [...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died. Jewett writes of this scene, [...] "Mac Sledge can't trust happiness because it remains inexplicable. But he does trust the tender mercies that mysteriously led him from death to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{was also}} called upon on {{occasion}} {{to deal with}} Montgomery, with whom his professional relationship as {{deputy chief of staff}} was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander.

[...] "I can't talk to him any more. Now you go on." [...] "As the campaign progressed," [...] Morgan later wrote, [...] "it became more difficult for us British at SHAEF to provide explanation, as we were continually called upon to do, for the attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field." [...] Senior British officers at SHAEF, notably Morgan, Kenneth Strong and Jock Whiteley remained loyal to Eisenhower. This cast <b>a</b> <b>pall</b> over their careers after the war, when Montgomery became Chief of the Imperial General Staff.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{continue}} {{on the underside of}} the bowl, starting with Agnes' burial. <b>A</b> <b>pall</b> is being laid over her sarcophagus, whose red enamel has significant losses, which reveal clearly the engraved lines beneath.

The banderole above says Ecce quod concupivi iam teneo ("Behold what I have desired I now possess"). In the next scene pagans have arrived to disrupt the burial, and only Emerentiana has stayed, kneeling in prayer as she is pelted with rocks. The inscription reads Veni soror mea mecum in gloria ("Come with me my sister into glory"). She dies, and the following scene shows the two martyrs, accompanied by two other unnamed female martyrs (in the source [...] "a great multitude of virgins clad in vestments of gold and silver"), as they appear in a vision to Agnes' friends eight days after her death, as they gather round her sarcophagus, into which Emerentiana's body has also been placed.|$|E
