40|$|Quantitative Risk Management (QRM) standardly {{concerns}} a vector of one-period profit-and-loss random variables X = (X 1, [...] .,Xd) ′ defined on some probability space (Ω,F,P). Risk Aggregation concerns {{the study of}} the aggregate financial position Ψ(X), for some measurable function Ψ: R d → R. Under the terms of the New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II), internationally active banks are required to set aside capital to offset various types of risks, i. e. market, credit and operational risk; see [4]. Under the new regulations, the vector X represents the profit-and-loss amounts for particular lines of risk or business, and this over a given period. A risk measure ρ maps the <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> Ψ(X) to ρ(Ψ(X)) ∈ R, to be interpreted as the regulatory capital needed to be able to hold the <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> Ψ(X) over this predetermined fixed period. The exact calculation of ρ(Ψ(X)) needs the joint distribution function FX of X; when such information is not available, special procedures are called for, typically leading to bounds on ρ(Ψ(X)). Risk Aggregation has often been studied within the framework when only the marginal distributions F 1, [...] .,Fd of the individual risks X 1, [...] .,Xd are available. A multitude of statistical techniques are available for estimating the univariate (marginal) distributions. It is often more difficult to capture statistically the d-variate structure of dependence of the vector X. Recently, especially in the management of operational risk, cases in which further dependence information is available have become relevant...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general result on the random selection of an element from an ordered sequence of risks and uses this result to derive additive and cross risk apportionment. Preferences favoring an {{improvement of the}} sampling distribution in univariate or bivariate first-order stochastic dominance are those exhibiting additive or cross risk apportionment. The univariate additive and multiplicative risk apportionment concepts are then related {{to the notion of}} bivariate cross risk apportionment by viewing the single-attribute utility function of an <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> (sum or product of attributes) as a 2 -attribute utility function. The results derived in the present paper allow one to further explore the connections between the different concepts of risk apportionment proposed so far in the literature...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe paper aims at {{estimating}} the blood velocity {{to enhance the}} navigation of an aggregate in the human vasculature. The considered system is a polymer binded aggregate of ferromagnetic nanorobots immersed in a blood vessel. The drag force depends on the blood velocity and specially acts on the aggregate dynamics. In the design of advanced control laws, the blood velocity is usually assumed to be known or set to a constant mean value to achieve the control objectives. We provide theoretical tools to on-line estimate the blood velocity from the sole measurement of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> and combine the state estimator with a backstepping control law. Two state estimation approaches are addressed and compared through simulations: a high gain observer and a receding horizon estimator.

40|$|Capital {{allocation}} {{principles are}} used in various contexts in which a risk capital or a cost of an <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> has to be allocated among its constituent parts. We study capital allocation principles in a performance measurement framework. We introduce the notation of suitability of allocations for performance measurement and show under different assumptions on the involved reward and risk measures that there exist suitable allocation methods. The existence of certain suitable allocation principles generally is given under rather strict assumptions on the underlying risk measure. Therefore we show, with a reformulated definition of suitability and in a slightly modified setting, {{that there is a}} known suitable allocation principle that does not require any properties of the underlying risk measure. Additionally we extend a previous characterization result from the literature from a mean-risk to a reward-risk setting. Formulations of this theory are also possible in a game theoretic setting...|$|E
40|$|Urban road {{congestion}} estimation is {{a challenge}} in traffic management. City traffic state can vary temporally and spatially between road links, depending on crossroads and lanes. In addition, congestion estimation requires some sort of tuning to “what is around” to trigger appropriate reactions. An adaptive aggregation mechanism of position data is therefore crucial for traffic control. We present a biologically-inspired technique to <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> samples coming from on-vehicle devices. In essence, each vehicle position sample is spatially and temporally augmented with digital pheromone information, locally deposited and evaporated. As a consequence, an aggregated pheromone concentration appears and stays spontaneously while many stationary vehicles and high density roads occur. Pheromone concentration is then sharpened to achieve a better distinction of critical phenomena to be triggered as detected traffic events. The overall mechanism can be actually enabled if structural parameters are correctly tuned for the given application context. Determining such correct parameters {{is not a simple}} task since different urban areas have different traffic flux and density. Thus, an appropriate tuning to adapt parameters to the specific urban area is desirable to make the estimation effective. In this paper, we show how this objective can be achieved by using differential evolution...|$|E

This article focuses on nuclear aggregation and the potential role of a specific compartment—the nucleolus, in the process. The nucleolus is a formation site of nucleolar aggresomes—protein and RNA aggregates formed in vitro by hampered proteasome function. Whether the nucleolar aggresomes are connected to nuclear aggregation involved in certain neurodegenerative diseases is an intriguing question for future studies. In addition, recent evidence connecting aggregation and aggregate sorting in the cytoplasm to membrane-enveloped organelles, namely ER and mitochondria, raises the question whether nuclear aggregation and <b>aggregate</b> <b>positioning</b> is controlled by different mechanisms or by the only membrane available—the nuclear membrane...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} and growing class of location-based mobile applications <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> data from individual devices at a server and compute aggregate statistics over these position streams. Because these devices {{can be linked}} to the movement of individuals, there is significant danger that the aggregate computation will violate the location privacy of individuals. This paper develops and evaluates PrivStats, a system for computing aggregate statistics over location data that simultaneously achieves two properties: first, provable guarantees on location privacy {{even in the face of}} any side information about users known to the server, and second, privacy-preserving accountability (i. e., protection against abusive clients uploading large amounts of spurious data). PrivStats achieves these properties using a new protocol for uploading and aggregating data anonymously as well as an efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge protocol we developed from scratch for accountability. We implemented our system on Nexus One smartphones and commodity servers. Our experimental results demonstrate that PrivStats is a practical system: computing a common aggregate (e. g., count) over the data of 10, 000 clients takes less than 0. 46 s at the server and the protocol has modest latency (0. 6 s) to upload data from a Nexus phone. We also validated our protocols on real driver traces from the CarTel project. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (grant 0931550) National Science Foundation (U. S.) (grant 0716273...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Visualization of {{specific}} molecules and their interactions {{in real time}} and space is essential to delineate how cellular dynamics and the signaling circuit are orchestrated. Spatial regulation of conformational dynamics and structural plasticity of protein interactions is re-quired to rewire signaling circuitry in response to extracellular cues. We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular protein interactions at nanometer spatial resolution in live cells, using photoactivatable complementary fluorescent (PACF) proteins. Subsets of comple-mentary fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized, and then bleached; {{this was followed by}} the assembly of superresolution images from <b>aggregate</b> <b>position</b> of sum interac-tive molecules. Using PACF, we obtained precise localization of dynamic microtubule plus-end hub protein EB 1 dimers and their distinct distributions at the leading edges and in the cell bodies of migrating cells. We further delineated the structure–function relationship of EB 1 by generating EB 1 -PACF dimers (EB 1 wt:EB 1 wt, EB 1 wt:EB 1 mt, and EB 1 mt:EB 1 mt) and imag-ing their precise localizations in culture cells. Surprisingly, our analyses revealed critical role of a previously uncharacterized EB 1 linker region in tracking microtubule plus ends in live cells. Thus PACF provides a unique approach to delineating spatial dynamics of homo- or heterodimerized proteins at the nanometer scale and establishes a platform to report the precise regulation of protein interactions in space and time in live cells...|$|E

This manipulation has concentrated attention on the functioning and governance of London futures markets, and in particular of the LME. This paper argues that futures market manipulation is not illegal under UK financial services regulation, but that in any case, deterrence is better than prosecution. Manipulation will be best deterred by greater transparency, in particular through mandatory reporting of client positions to exchanges, but also through the publication of suitably <b>aggregated</b> <b>positions</b> data.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} essays on topics related to market microstructure. In the first essay, we analyze algorithmic trading in the Korean Index Futures market. We document that short-term traders consistently anticipate the order flow of large traders that build large positions {{within a short}} period of time. We study trade-by-trade data around 36, 164 trades by large traders among the largest 1 % of all active trades during 66 trading days in 2009 from the Korean Index Futures market. We find that large traders manage their orders first by executing small, positively correlated trades, which are followed by a single large trade. While the small trades are executed, short-term traders gradually increase their inventories {{in the direction of the}} forthcoming large trade. After the execution of the large trade, short-term traders unload their inventories to other traders. We find that short-term traders correctly anticipate the direction of large trades 56. 06 % of the time. Furthermore, the <b>aggregate</b> <b>positions</b> of short-term traders are statistically significant predictors for the direction of large trades that will arrive within 120 seconds. In the second essay, we explore market microstructure invariance in the Korean stock market. We define the number of buy-sell “switching points” based on the number of times that individual traders change the direction of their trading. Based on the hypothesis that switching points take place in business time, market microstructure invariance predicts that the aggregate number of switching points is proportional to the 2 / 3 power of the product of dollar volume and volatility. Using trading data from the Korea Exchange (KRX) from 2008 to 2010, we estimate the exponent to be 0. 675 with standard error of 0. 005. Invariance explains about 93 % of the variation in the logarithm of the number of switching points each month across stocks...|$|R
