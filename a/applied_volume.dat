It also added the ability to map several samples to the same instrument for multi-sampled instruments or drum sets.

It uses MOD effect command letters, plus a few of its own for more sound control. The composer can define initial tempos and speeds; provide envelopes to samples by assigning them to instruments; set sample looping and apply automatic sample vibrato oscillation.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, {{advances}} in solid-state electronics made {{the design and}} marketing of more sophisticated analog circuitry economically feasible. This led {{to a number of}} attempts to reduce tape hiss through the use of various forms of volume compression and expansion, the most notable and commercially successful being several systems developed by Dolby Laboratories. These systems divided the frequency spectrum into several bands and <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> compression/expansion independently to each band (Engineers now often use the term [...] "compansion" [...] to refer to this process). The Dolby systems were very successful at increasing the effective dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of analog audio recording; to all intents and purposes, audible tape hiss could be eliminated. The original Dolby A was only used in professional recording. Successors found use in both professional and consumer formats; Dolby B became almost universal for prerecorded music on cassette. Subsequent forms, including Dolby C, (and the short-lived Dolby S) were developed for home use.|$|E

40|$|A new {{laboratory}} {{method was}} proposed {{to establish an}} easily performed standard for the determination of mobile soil water close to real conditions during the infiltration and redistribution of water in a soil. It consisted of <b>applying</b> a water <b>volume</b> with a tracer ion {{on top of an}} undisturbed ring sample on a pressure plate under a known suction or pressure head. Afterwards, soil water mobility was determined by analyzing the tracer-ion concentration in the soil sample. Soil water mobility showed to be a function of the <b>applied</b> water <b>volume.</b> No relation between soil water mobility and applied pressure head could be established with data from the present experiment. A simple one- or two-parameter equation can be fitted to the experimental data to parameterize soil water mobility as a function of <b>applied</b> solute <b>volume.</b> Sandy soils showed higher mobility than loamy soils at low values of <b>applied</b> solute <b>volumes,</b> and both sandy and loamy soils showed an almost complete mobility at high <b>applied</b> solute <b>volumes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A model {{predicting}} the spray droplet interception and retention {{by a single}} virtual plant has been developed. The model was based on three main experimental inputs: the 3 D architecture of a barley plant, the spray quality and the droplet impact behavior. Two contrasted formulation scenarios, limits of the common range covered by pesticide application in terms of surface tension, were tested by changing the droplet behavior at impact in the model. Simulations were undertaken for studying the variability of spray retention resulting from spray quality, <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> and plant size for a difficult-to-treat target. Results showed that the spray retention efficiency ranged from 6. 8 % to 96. 6 % of a theoretical full adhesion scenario, where all intercepted droplets were captured, according to spray quality for the two formulation scenarios tested. Average retention increased with increasing spray fineness, <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> per hectare and plant size. Variability of deposits, evaluated using the coefficient of variation of simulated retentions, {{was found to be}} a function of the mean droplet density according to CV∝N^(- 0. 68), where CV is the coefficient of variation and N the number of droplet per square centimeter. Variability was also found to be a function of the plant size according to a relation CV∝S^(- 0. 5), where S is the total leaf area of the plant model. The variability of deposits increased with decreasing spray fineness, <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> per hectare and plant size because of the reduced number of droplets contributing to retention. Wetting properties greatly influenced retention but surprisingly poorly influenced the variability of deposits. Such a modeling approach that is capable of an independent investigation of the influence of various parameters on spray retention can be used to improve understanding of application methods and adjuvants that could help minimizing development of resistance in problematic weed species.

40|$|For {{assessment}} of the efficacy of surgical hand disinfection, European reference method prEN 12791 prescribes that the hands must be kept wet with the reference alcohol for 3 min regardless of the <b>applied</b> <b>volume.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> of the reference disinfectant n-propanol (60 %, vol/vol) influences the effect on the resident hand flora. Ten experiments with 200 reference disinfections were analyzed. Hands were washed for 1 min with soap. The bacterial prevalue was obtained by rubbing fingertips in tryptic soy broth for 1 min. After this, each subject treated the hands with n-propanol (60 %, vol/vol) by using as many portions as necessary to keep hands wet for a total of 3 min. Bacterial postvalues (immediate effect) were obtained for one hand, and the other hand was gloved for 3 h. After the gloves were taken off, a second postvalue was obtained (sustained effect). Most surgical reference disinfections (73 %) were achieved with 9 ml of the reference alcohol, followed by 12 ml (24 %) and 6 ml (3 %). There was no significant difference between the mean log 10 reduction values for the three treatment groups, both in terms of the immediate effect (P = 0. 333, as determined by analysis of variance) and in terms of the sustained effect (P = 0. 442). A higher number of portions did not correlate with a higher reduction factor (for immediate effect, Pearson's correlation coefficient = − 0. 028 [P = 0. 689]; for sustained effect, Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0. 059 [P = 0. 404]).

An in-situ evaluation {{of water and}} solute movement from a point source was made by using both the gravimetric and the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) methods. An evaluation {{of the performance of}} the TDR method was examined by comparing the results to that of the gravimetric method. The CHAIN_ 2 D numerical model was also evaluated for information extrapolation from a limited number of field experiments. The water entry radius for the application rates of 1. 5, 2. 0, and 2. 5 liters per hour were 13. 0, 16. 5, and 19. 5 centimeters, respectively. The water entry radius increased with increase in the application rate for a specific soil. There was an increased soil water content with both a higher application rate and <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> up to about 25 and 30 cm in depth and radial distance, respectively, beyond which the difference was not significant. There was an increase in solute concentration with higher input concentration, <b>applied</b> <b>volume,</b> and application rate up to the same depth and radial distance as for soil water content, beyond which, again there was no significant difference. Soil water profiles developed from TDR data were comparable with those of the gravimetric method. Electrical conductivity measured both with the TDR method and an EC meter were also comparable. An exponentially decreasing function between the TDR probe lengths and their geometric constants was developed. Based on evaluation results, the TDR method may be qualified as a practical and useful technique to develop soil water content and salinity profiles when irrigation is through a point source. A close agreement between the CHAIN- 2 D model results and the gravimetric measurements was obtained. The results of this field study of water and solute movement may be used as a basis for recommendations on water and chemical application through drip irrigation...|$|E

The dotted protein was further scanned and analysed to perform quantitative measurements for relative comparison. The intensity of the red protein spot and its surface area varied depending on the membrane pore size, demonstrating the dependence of protein immobilization on this factor. The membrane with the smallest pore size (M 3) showed the highest protein spot intensity and surface area when examined at different protein concentrations.

Dynamic light scattering was then used to characterize osmotically induced shape changes by monitoring changes in the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). These changes are compared to those predicted for several shapes that appear in trajectories through the phase diagram of the area difference elasticity (ADE) model (Jarić et al. 1995. Phys. Rev. E. 52 : 6623 – 6634). Measurements were performed on dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) vesicles using two membrane-impermeant osmolytes (NaCl and sucrose) and a membrane-permeant osmolyte (urea). For all conditions, we were able to produce low-polydispersity, nearly spherical vesicles, which are essential for resolving well-defined volume changes and consequent shape changes. Hyper-osmotic dilutions of DOPC vesicles in urea produced no change in Rh, whereas similar dilutions in NaCl or sucrose caused reductions in vesicle volume resulting in observable changes to Rh. Under conditions similar to those of this study, the ADE model predicts an evolution from spherical to prolate then oblate shapes on increasing volume reduction of LUVs. However, we found that DOPC vesicles became oblate at all <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> reductions...|$|E

The addition of OLA both in Se and Cd side was demonstrated advantageous to increase the reactivity of Cd monomer and promote the diffusion of the two precursors, which resulted in CdSe NCs with quite narrow FWHM of PL. The addition of OLA in the source solution resulted in significant improvement of both size distribution and QY of CdSe NCs, and high OLA concentration is favored to prepare highly luminescent CdSe NCs with small size as well as narrow size distribution. When the <b>applied</b> <b>volume</b> percentage of OLA exceeded 37.5 %, long-term fixing of FWHM was observed, and high QY of PL was maintained over a long period. The obtained results facilitate an easy tuning of PL range by the variation of residence time. With 3 mL OLA in the source solution, a size series (2.3 – 3.6 nm) of highly luminescent CdSe NCs (QY 35 – 55 %) with narrow FWHM of PL (26 – 31 nm) were obtained under varied residence time from 2 s to 160 s.|$|E
