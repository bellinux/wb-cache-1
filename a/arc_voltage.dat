5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used <b>arc</b> <b>voltage</b> to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E
25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the <b>arc</b> <b>voltage</b> is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and nominal voltage of the circuit breaker.|$|E

The metal inert gas pulse brazing process parameters used in this study included wire feed speeds, <b>arc</b> <b>voltages,</b> travel speed, peak currents, and pulse frequency.

This can be achieved with {{on the one hand}} by an appropriate electrode control {{and on the other hand}} by a minimum of AC transformer switching. Electrical arc is a stochastic process; witch is the principal cause of power quality problems, including voltages dips, harmonic distortion, unbalance loads and flicker.

The low Earth orbit plasma environment was simulated in plasma vacuum chambers, where the parameters could be controlled precisely. Diagnostic equipment included spherical Langmuir probes, mass spectrometer, low-noise CCD camera with optical spectrometer, video camera, very sensitive current probe to measure arc current, and a voltage probe to register variations in a conductor potential. All data (except video) were obtained in digital form that allowed us to study the correlation between external parameters (plasma density, additional capacitance, bias <b>voltage,</b> etc) and <b>arc</b> characteristics (arc rate, arc current pulse width and amplitude, gas species partial pressures, and intensities of spectral lines). <b>Arc</b> inception <b>voltages,</b> <b>arc</b> rates, and current collections are measured for samples with different coverglass materials and thickness, interconnect designs, and cell sizes. It is shown that the array with wrapthrough interconnects have the highest arc threshold and the lowest current collection. Coverglass design with overhang results in decrease of current collection and increase of arc threshold. Doubling coverglass thickness causes the increase in <b>arc</b> inception <b>voltage.</b> Both <b>arc</b> inception <b>voltage</b> and current collection increase significantly with increasing a sample temperature to 80 C. Sustained discharges are initiated between adjacent cells with potential differences of 40 V for the sample with 300 m coverglass thickness and 60 V for the sample with 150 m coverglass thickness. Installation of cryogenic pump in large vacuum chamber provided the possibility of considerable outgassing of array surfaces which resulted in significant decrease of arc rate. Arc sites were determined by employing a video-camera, and it is shown that the most probable sites for arc inception are triple-junctions, even though some arcs were initiated in gaps between cells. It is also shown that the arc rate increases with increasing of ion collection current. The analysis of optical spectra (240 - 800 nm) reveals intensive narrow atomic lines (Ag, H) and wide molecular bands (OH, CH, SiH, SiN) that confirms a complicated mechanism of arc plasma generation.
