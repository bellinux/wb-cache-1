This research analysis underlines that parties to NIAC are obliged through GC Common Article 3 to enter into special agreements and by CIHL to adhere to the criteria contained in GC IV Art 49. The work of the ICRC and Geneva Call suggests that the inclusion of relevant provisions in agreement documents provide a binding form of legal protection, which can immediately reduce civilian vulnerability to specific violations (Lacroix et al. 2011; Ruaudel 2013). Common agreement documents for application by stakeholders might be drafted, which are specific to or give particular attention to forced displacement and illegal appropriation through displacement (Mack and Pejic 2008). These documents might include, for example, a deed of commitment on forced displacement and HLP pillage (Personal Interview 2016). Recommended activities might include (a) identifying the root causes and patterns of displacement through contextually relevant research; (b) establishing key stakeholder relations identifying their needs, motives, and objectives; (c) continuous contextual risk analysis, including assessment of existing armed actor engagement, and threat to civilians or humanitarian staff; (d) stakeholder training in IHL/IHRL and the creation of unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral agreements; (e) the creation and adoption of special agreements with armed parties and key stakeholders; and (f) the establishment of monitoring, reporting, verification, and enforcement mechanisms.|$|E

The {{article focuses}} {{on the issue of}} the {{international}} arbitral tribunals’ authority to disregard supposedly applicable statutory provisions of a given national law, which it deems to be non-compliant with relevant constitutional norms from the perspective of the Polish constitutional and arbitration law. Due to the fact that, in recent years, the present issue attracted a significant attention from the international academia, the analysis of the article begins with the report of various positions adopted by some of the leading international scholars on the matter in question. This initial study provides a firm basis for further exploration of this issue in light of the Polish law, which is preceded by a brief summary of the fundamental constitutional principles and notions underpinning the contemporary Polish legal order. Such critical analysis drives the author to a conclusion that there are no sufficiently persuasive arguments which would justify barring international arbitrators from applying the Polish substantive law in its entirety, including denying <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> violating the Constitution, which will supersede other normative acts. Conversely, the exercise of such arbitral review amounts to a basic duty of arbitrators (integral part of their mandate to resolve a dispute in accordance with the Polish law as the applicable substantive law of a dispute) rather than their discretionary authority...|$|E

40|$|The {{changes taking}} place today in Russian legislation, with all its new subtleties, {{raise the issue of}} making legal {{language}} comprehensible to the ordinary citizen. Dealing with this question largely depends on improvements in juridical procedures and making use of the best possible linguistic resources. At the same time, there are some areas of legislation where typically, on the one hand, there are profound changes in the laws themselves while on the other hand, they are governed by their relationship to this law. These areas include that of intellectual property rights, which are codified in the Russian Federation’s Civil Code, Chapter IV. The wording used in the chapter in question was used as material for discussion regarding the clarity and comprehensibility of legal texts. It was found that, in its legal formulations, this document uses an excessive amount of new and borrowed terms, approximate and ethical concepts, nominalizations and complex syntactic structures, thus making it more difficult {{to make sense of the}} legislation. In overcoming comprehension difficulties regarding new legislation a key role is played by the practical commentary which accompanies the law. Acting as a kind of text-broker, this commentary interprets and clarifies the law, thereby fostering the successful understanding of legal rights throughout the whole population. The commentary examined in the current study offers guidelines regarding recommendations for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>provisions</b> pursuant to Part IV of the Russian Federation Civil Code, issued by the Russian Federation Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This text is of linguistic interest in terms of its structure, core content and discourse techniques which aim to ensure that anything that cannot be understood by the layman is “filtered out”. The methods adopted in the comparative analysis of the legal–normative text and the commentary were those employed in other works analysing the reformulation of acts in different forms and types of communication. The unit of analysis adopted was the minimum commentary unit – the main component of any commentary text. In the Guidelines the size of the unit may vary, extending over one or more sentences or even paragraphs. It is made up of various combinations of the following components: a reference to a commented-on text, a direct quote from a legal text, a reformulated norm (with or without indication) and the actual commentary itself, as well as metacommunicative devices accompanying other components of the unit which is being commented on. This article offers an analysis of some of the most productive types of reformulating techniques found in the Guidelines. These are principally: exemplification, renaming, syntactic simplification and rearrangement, enumeration and precision...|$|E
40|$|The modern Strauss–Howe generational theory {{created at}} the {{intersection}} of economic, sociological, historical and psychological Sciences.
