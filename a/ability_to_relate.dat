5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> to the topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, {{he was able to}} write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E

25|$|While Lewis {{is known}} {{today on the}} {{strength}} of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children’s writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time it was fashionable for children's stories to be realistic; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overtly moralistic or the Christian elements over-stated — attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.|$|E
40|$|AbstractStarting {{from the}} {{increase}} of families hiring nannies, studies revealing {{the influence of the}} nanny's conduct on the child's development and the absence in Romania of standardized and valid tests for evaluating nannies’ performance, the objective of this exploratory study was the evaluation of nannies’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> with the child, in relation to parental competence dimensions and professional performance criteria. The results of the research (conducted on 65 live-in nannies) proved that the adapted Parental Competence Questionnaire could be used for evaluating nannies’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> with the child and that these abilities were predictors for performance...|$|R

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
25|$|Literary critic Hugh M. Richmond {{notes that}} Richard's {{beliefs about the}} Divine Right of Kings tend to fall {{more in line with}} the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke on the other hand {{represents}} a more modern view of the throne, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political savvy contribute to the makings of a good king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God, that he is not subject to human frailty, and that the English people are his to do with as he pleases. Elliott argues that this mistaken notion of his role as king ultimately leads to Richard's failure. Elliott goes on further to point out that it is Bolingbroke's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> and speak with those of the middle and lower classes that allows him to take the throne.|$|E
25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It is as if Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
30|$|The fifth {{theme to}} be {{established}} involves improvements in participants’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> <b>to</b> other people and to be compassionate. People with addiction problems often have difficulties with interpersonal relationships, and the resulting conflicts often lead to relapse (Marlatt, 1985 b;Turner et al. 1997;Turner et al. 2013). A number of participants in our study responded that they had achieved {{a better understanding of}} social relationships. Others noted that they had learned not to judge people so quickly. Two people reported being better listeners, one of whom also noted that by using mindfulness techniques, s/he was less reactive, which in turn reduced conflicts. Another participant explained that close friends and family had noticed a positive change in his/her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> listen. These responses indicate that learning the mindfulness techniques improved participants’ understanding of and their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> interact with other people. This finding is significant because it shows that mindfulness may help reduce interpersonal conflict, which can be a major stressor and trigger for people in early recovery.|$|R

It contains 44 questions to which respondents are asked to answer using a four-point (i.e., forced) Likert scale, expressing whether they strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly disagree with the specific statement. The responses are used to generate a general score as well as specific scores {{for each of the}} six dimensions. A higher score reflects a higher level of development in the social and personal competencies.|$|R

The Test leg-spinner, Arthur Mailey noted, [...] "I learnt more of the psychology of cricket from Collins from all the hundreds of cricketers I met." [...] Bert Oldfield said of Collins, [...] "He studied every player's temperament and acted accordingly." [...] Collins was undemonstrative, expecting his fieldsmen {{to look at him}} every after every delivery and adjust their position in response to his slight hand movements or even a bent finger. He was last to shower {{at the end of a}} day's play, preferring to sit in a corner in silence. His team mates assumed that he was contemplating the day's action and pondering on the next day's possibilities. He was a successful Test captain, leading Australia to five wins and two losses; four matches finished in draws.|$|E
500|$|Critic Darcy Sullivan saw {{the book}} as {{presenting}} how Brown's Playboy obsession affects his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> to women. [...] Sullivan called The Playboy stories [...] "he most honest sex in comics" [...] of the early 1990s, [...] "and the most damning exposé of pornography" [...] as it deals [...] "with nothing more than Brown's relationship with Playboy". [...] He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller {{over the course of}} The Playboy, and for the believability of scenes {{which may or may not}} have happened as Brown depicted them. [...] While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns, Brown depicts himself as [...] "a victim of his urges", and that [...] "Playboy has kept him mentally separate". [...] Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need, but fosters an addiction. [...] Brown's comics raise questions, rather than trying to answer them, an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt's less subtle body of work, which also details a pornography obsession: he wrote that Matt's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession, while Brown's reveal.|$|E

2500|$|A {{promising}} {{and intelligent}} youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease {{left him with}} a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>relate</b> to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. [...] "I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over a past that was beyond my reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to the fact that my hearing was gone and would probably never return."
