5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|The silver penny {{was almost}} the only coin used in middle and later Anglo-Saxon England. Æthelwulf's coinage came from a main mint in Canterbury and a {{secondary}} one at Rochester; both had been used by Egbert for his own coinage after he gained control of Kent. During Æthelwulf's reign, there were four main phases of the coinage distinguishable at both mints, though they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> parallel and it is uncertain when the transitions took place. The first issue at Canterbury carried a design known as Saxoniorum, which had been used by Egbert {{for one of his}} own issues. This was replaced by a portrait design in about 843, which can be subdivided further; the earliest coins have cruder designs than the later ones. At the Rochester mint the sequence was reversed, with an initial portrait design replaced, also in about 843, by a non-portrait design carrying a cross-and-wedges pattern on the obverse.|$|E

25|$|An eclipse {{does not}} happen at every new or full moon, because {{the plane of the}} orbit of the Moon around the Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun (the ecliptic): so as seen from the Earth, when the Moon is nearest to the Sun (new moon) or at largest {{distance}} (full moon), the three bodies usually <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> on the same line.|$|E

25|$|In 2007 the Highland Council, {{which is}} now the local {{government}} authority, created the Caithness ward management area, which has boundaries {{similar to those of}} the historic county. It was divided between three new wards electing councillors by the single transferable vote system of election, which is designed to produce a form of proportional representation. One ward elects four councillors. Each of the other two elects three councillors. Also, the council's eight management areas were abolished, in favour of three new corporate management areas, with Caithness becoming a ward management area within the council's new Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross operational management area, which covers seven of the council's 22 new wards. The boundaries of the Caithness ward management area <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> those of the former Caithness management area, but they do include the village of Reay.|$|E
25|$|The {{possibility}} of using water isotope depletion with elevation to reconstruct paleoaltimetry was demonstrated {{as early as}} the late 1960s, when Caltech geochemist Samuel Epstein tried to collect rainwater at different elevations in a single storm. The δ18O and δD lapse rates vary within -1 to -5‰/km and -10 to -40‰/km respectively, but can vary with locations and seasons, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> linear with altitude. One of the first studies in stable isotope paleoaltimetry demonstrated a meteoric water δD signature of -90 to -139‰ in fluid inclusions in quartz and adularia in an epithermal gold-silver deposit in Nevada, and suggested the applicability of stable isotopes in reconstruction of ancient topography in the Great Basin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of hydrous silicate minerals have since then been used to reconstruct topographic histories in mountain ranges across the world, including the North American Cordillera, the Rocky Mountains, the Himalayas, the European Alps, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. Lab experiments with clay minerals have shown that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions are relatively resistant to alteration at moderate temperature (<100nbsp&°C), and can preserve the original meteoric water signal. One important effect of mountain ranges on rainfall stable isotopes is the rain shadow effect, in which an isotopic depletion happens in precipitation on the leeward side compared to the windward side. A change in the difference in isotopic composition of precipitation on the two sides of a mountain can be used to infer the magnitude of the rain shadow effect. In one such study, an isotope enrichment was observed in smectite {{on the east side of}} the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-Miocene to late Pliocene, suggesting a decrease in elevation during this period. Another study found δD values around -140‰ in muscovite in the North America Cordillera during the early Eocene, which would suggest an elevation 1000m higher than today at the time. In addition to hydrous minerals, hydrogen isotopes in biomarkers such as leaf waxes have also been developed for paleoaltimetry studies. The δD lapse rate in leaf waxes (-21‰/km) falls in the range of meteoric water observations. As an example study, leaf wax δD data have been used to confirm hydrous mineral paleoaltimetry for the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada during the Eocene.|$|E

500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... {{things that are happening}} in L.A. [...] <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E
500|$|As {{the serial}} progressed, Pauline contends with {{a plethora of}} family upsets, which include many deaths—her mother Lou in 1988, brother Pete in 1993 and husband Arthur in 1996—as well as her elder son Mark's fatal battle with HIV. After a year long build-up, Mark is shown to reveal his HIV status to his stunned and devastated parents in an episode that aired on Boxing Day 1991, {{attracting}} 19million viewers. Wendy Richard has given her interpretation of Pauline's reaction to Mark's news: [...] "To say she was shell-shocked was an understatement and, not knowing enough about HIV, she and Arthur were worrying that their eldest son might die from AIDS at any moment." [...] The HIV plot had many ramifications for the character of Pauline, as she struggles {{to come to terms}} with her son's condition. It was also instrumental in raising public awareness about the illness, which was still the subject of much ignorance when EastEnders tackled it in 1991. When the storyline initially aired, more people went for a HIV test in Britain than at any other time. Wendy Richard commented: [...] "The storyline with Mark Fowler, when he announced he was HIV positive, was really well done. People have to be aware that HIV and AIDS <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> the same thing. The Minister of Health who was in power at that time wrote a letter complimenting us for the way that we had put the information across." ...|$|E

Less well known is that Heaviside's equations and Maxwell's <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> the same, and in fact it is easier to modify the latter to make them compatible with quantum physics.

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{variation of}} four-wave-mixing-based frequency combs {{is known as}} Kerr frequency comb. Here, a single laser is coupled into a microresonator (such as a microscopic glass disk that has whispering-gallery modes). This kind of structure naturally has a series of resonant modes with approximately equally spaced frequencies (similar to a Fabry–Pérot interferometer). Unfortunately the resonant modes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>exactly</b> equally spaced due to dispersion. Nevertheless, the four-wave mixing effect above can create and stabilize a perfect frequency comb in such a structure. Basically, the system generates a perfect comb that overlaps the resonant modes as much as possible. In fact, nonlinear effects can shift the resonant modes to improve the overlap with the perfect comb even more. (The resonant mode frequencies depend on refractive index, which is altered by the optical Kerr effect.) ...|$|E
