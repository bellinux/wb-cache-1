5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E

5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climatic deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. Climate change had a major impact on agriculture in this period and terms emerged to describe different quantities of land. In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the ploughgate, also known as the davoch and in Lennox as the arachor. It may have measured about , divided into 4 raths. The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.|$|E

The <b>average</b> <b>amount</b> for the whole month of June is around 50-60 l/m².

40|$|When {{clustering}} asymmetric proximity data, {{only the}} <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> are often considered by {{assuming that the}} asymmetry is due to noise. But when the asymmetry is structural, as typically may happen for exchange flows, migration data or confusion data, this may strongly affect {{the search for the}} groups because the directions of the exchanges are ignored and not integrated in the clustering process. The clustering model proposed here relies on the decomposition of the asymmetric dissimilarity matrix into symmetric and skew-symmetric effects both decomposed in within and between cluster effects. The classification structures used here are generally based on two different partitions of the objects fitted to the symmetric and the skew-symmetric part of the data, respectively; the restricted case is also presented where the partition fits jointly both of them allowing for clusters of objects similar with respect to the <b>average</b> <b>amounts</b> and directions of the data. Parsimonious models are presented which allow for effective and simple graphical representations of the results...|$|R
