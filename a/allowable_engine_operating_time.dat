The vehicle used for this research was an eighteen meter city bus equipped with a CI engine with a displacement of 9. 2 dm 3. The latest PEMS mobile equipment technology was used to conduct the road measurements. This allowed the emission indicators for CO, HC, NOx and PM to be determined, including specific emissions.

40|$|This new {{equipment}} determines ageing of a fluid, especially (engine) oil. Physical {{properties of the}} fluid are measured initially and subsequently. A comparator determines {{the state of the}} fluid from these results. Also claimed are the corresponding procedure and sensor unit. Preferably the instrument measures viscosity, viscoelasticity, density, dielectric constant and/or the fluid conductivity. To measure viscosity, viscoelasticity and/or density, a surface wave sensor (SAW device) is used. This has interdigital transducers (12, 14). Dielectric constant and/or conductivity are measured from the complex impedance exhibited by one of the transducers (12). This transducer is connected to a first oscillator, allowing the resonant frequency and/or damping of the electroacoustic waves produced, to be determined. This yields values for viscoelasticity and/or damping. USE - To determine the state of ageing in a fluid, especially engine oil, enabling a rational replacement decision. ADVANTAGE - A comparatively simple interdigital sensor unit, a piezoelectric surface acoustic wave device (SAW), with appropriate instrumentation, takes a surprising wide range of physical measurements as described. This allows good oil to be retained, rather than replacing it unconditionally on only loosely relevant measurements of <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> or distance interval.

Build number 11 and 12 of engine S/N 1 totaled 28 burning hours and constituted a single assembly of the engine core [...] the compressor, both turbines, and the gearbox. Build number 11 of engine S/N 1 included a 1 : 07 hr continuous test at 100 % gasifier speed (86, 000 rpm). Build number 8 of engine S/N 2 was the first engine test with a ceramic turbine rotor. A mechanical loss test of an engine assembly revealed the actual losses to be near the original design allowance. Component development activity included rig testing of the compressor, combustor, and regenerator. Compressor testing was initiated on a rig modified to control the transfer of heat between flow path, lubricating oil, and structure. Results show successful thermal decoupling of the rig and lubricating/cooling oil. Rig evaluation of a reduced-friction compressor was initiated. Combustor testing covered qualification of ceramic parts for engine use, mapping of operating range limits, and evaluation of a relocated igniter plug. Several seal refinements were tested on the hot regenerator rig. An alternate regenerator disk, extruded MAS, was examined and found to be currently inadequate for the AGT 100 application. Also, a new technique for measuring leakage was explored on the regenerator rig.

40|$|A magnetoplasma {{spacecraft}} engine, {{such as the}} Variable Area Specific Inpulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR?), uses {{magnetic fields}} and a magnetic nozzle to constrict and accelerate plasma to produce thrust. Most of the ejected plasma particles are expected to detach from the magnetic field lines and escape to provide thrust but some particles may not and could impact the spacecraft structure resulting in surface erosion and electrical charging. The plasma plume for a magnetoplasma engine was modeled computationally and scaled to determine what percentage of particles remained in the magnetic field and the kinetic energy of all impacting particles. Factors such as average particle velocity at the engine exit, magnetic field strength, and plume density distribution (i. e. width) were varied in a full factorial experiment to ascertain the effects of each factor and the important inter-relationships. The results are presented for a generic magnetoplasma engine and for the specific VASIMR? case. Detachment {{was found to be}} occurring with 99. 42 % of particles escaping under the worst conditions and only 0. 0172 % of particles impacting structure. It was determined that three things led to {{an increase in the number}} of impacting particles on spacecraft structure: a stronger magnetic field, a lower exit velocity of particles into the plume, and a wider plume. In addition, there was an ?erosion zone? where an increasing particle exit velocity led to more erosion until the number of impacting particles was negligible and erosion dropped significantly. For the specific case under nominal conditions, the erosion rate was 1. 386 nm/month of <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> on aluminum and 0. 611 nm/month on silicon. The electrical charging on spacecraft surfaces was found to be - 27. 85 V DC, which can be mitigated with current plasma contactor technology or some variant.

40|$|The {{production}} of electricity from the solar cells continues to attract interest as a power source for distributed energy eration. It {{is important to be}} able to estimate solar cell power to optimize system energy management. This paper proposes a prediction algorithm based on a neural network (NN) to predict the electricity production from a solar cell. The operation plan for a combined solar cell and diesel engine generator system is examined using the NN prediction algorithm. Two systems are examined in this paper: one with and one without a power storage facility. Comparisons are presented of the results from the two systems with respect to the actual calculations of output power and the predicted electricity production from the solar cell. The exhaust heat from the engine is used to supply the heat demand. A back-up boiler is <b>operated</b> when the <b>engine</b> exhaust heat is insufficient to meet the heat demand.

In contrast to the quasi-statically <b>operated</b> Carnot <b>engine</b> whose efficiency reaches the theoretical maximum, recent research on more realistic <b>engines</b> <b>operated</b> in finite <b>time</b> has revealed other classes of efficiency such as the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency maximizing the power output.

Due to the nature of our model, the time-dependent part is completely decoupled from the other terms in the generated work. We derive analytically the optimal condition for transition rates maximizing the generated power output and discuss its implication on general premise of realistic heat engines. In particular, the optimal engine efficiency of our model is different from the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency, although they share the universal linear and quadratic coefficients at the near-equilibrium limit. We further confirm our results by taking an alternative approach in terms of the entropy production at hot and cold reservoirs. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
