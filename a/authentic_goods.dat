The dearth of high-precision data precludes not only empirical analysis - including the quanti. cation of various elasticities - but also the informed policy analysis that results from the integration of empirical results with government, market, and social institutions. We propose and conduct a controlled laboratory market in counterfeit goods on several groups of subjects in Hong Kong and Las Vegas. The data generated in the experiments are used to estimate a random-effects model of individual choice behavior. The main empirical findings are that subjects in Hong Kong {{are more likely to}} purchase the counterfeit good than are subjects in Las Vegas; the price and penalty elasticities are substantially larger (in absolute value) in Las Vegas than in Hong Kong; and that in both locations the price effects of legitimate and counterfeit goods are asymmetrical in the monetary price and expected penalty cost.

5000|$|Rayban, Rolex, and Louis Vuitton are {{the most}} copied brands worldwide, with Nike being the most counterfeited brand {{globally}} according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Counterfeit clothes, shoes, jewelry and handbags from designer brands are made in varying quality; sometimes the intent is only to fool the gullible buyer who only looks at the label and {{does not know what}} the real thing looks like, while others put some serious effort into mimicking fashion details. Others realize that most consumers do not care if the goods they buy are counterfeit and just wish to purchase inexpensive products. The popularity of designer jeans in 1978, spurred a flood of knockoffs. Factories that manufacture counterfeit designer brand garments and watches are usually located in developing countries, with between 85-95% of all counterfeit goods coming from China. International tourists visiting Beijing, China, may find a wide selection of counterfeit designer brand garments at the Silk Street. Expensive watches are vulnerable to counterfeiting as well. In Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, authentic looking but poor quality watch fakes with self-winding mechanisms and fully working movements can sell for as little as US $20 to good quality ones that sell for $100 and over. Also some fakes' movements and materials are of remarkably passable quality [...] - [...] albeit inconsistently so [...] - [...] and may look good and work well for some years, a possible consequence of increasing competition within the counterfeiting community. Some counterfeiters have began to manufacture their goods in the same factory as the <b>authentic</b> <b>goods.</b> Yuandan goods is a term used to describe those fakes that are produced in the same factory as legitimate designer pieces without authorized permission to do so. These goods are made from scraps and leftover materials from the genuine products, produced illegally and sold on the black market.|$|E
40|$|Papirer' {{is a large}} {{collection}} of Kierkegaard's private and intimate notes, published posthumously. They reveal a crucial influence of Kierkegaard's constant expectation of his immediate death on his existential philosophy. Kierkegaard sees the relationship to one's own finiteness and mortality as the hallmark of one's spiritual standing. The 'situation of death', i. e. an authentic confrontation with the inescapability of one's own death, becomes for Kierkegaard a privileged moment of both {{the discovery of the}} truth about the authenticity or the lack of the authenticity of one's own existence, and of the spiritual transformation. The crucial condition of such transformation is the 'death to the world'. One dies to the world by giving up freely all desires directed towards anything other than God, the Infinite Good, and in fact the only <b>authentic</b> <b>good.</b> The 'situation of death' helps to make this existentially crucial step, because it creates a necessary separation of the individual from the 'crowd'. 'Sickness unto Death' is for Kierkegaard a state of mind, characterized by despair, of someone who failed to achieve a truthful relationship with his own mortality, and ultimately with his own existence...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} problem of {{parallel}} imports: unauthorized flows of products across countries, which compete with authorized distribution channels. The traditional economics model of a discriminating monopolist that has different prices for the same good in different markets requires the markets to be separated in some way, usually geographically. The profits from price discrimination can be threatened by parallel imports that allow consumers in the high-priced region some access to the low-priced marketplace. However, as this article shows, {{there is a very}} real possibility that parallel imports may actually increase profits. The basic intuition is that parallel importation becomes another channel for the <b>authentic</b> <b>goods</b> and creates a new product version that allows the manufacturer to price discriminate. We propose a two-country, three-stage model to quantitatively study the effects and strategies. In the third stage, and in the higher priced country where parallel imports have entered, we characterize the resulting market segmentation. One segment of consumers stays with the authorized version as they place more value on the warranty and services that come with the authorized version. Another segment switches to parallel imports because a lower price is offered due to lack of country-specific features or warranties. Parallel imports also generate a third and new segment that would not have bought this product before. Unlike counterfeits that are fabricated by imitators, all parallel imports are genuine and sourced from the manufacturer in the lower-priced country through authorized dealers. Therefore, the manufacturer's global sales quantity should increase, but profit may rise or fall depending on the relative sizes and profitability of the segments. A profit-maximizing parallel importer should set price and quantity in the second stage after observing the manufacturer's prices in both countries. There will be a threshold of across-country price gap above which parallel imports would occur. In the first stage, the manufacturer can anticipate the possible occurrence of a parallel import, its price and quantity, and its effect on authorized sales in each country to make a coordinated pricing decision to maximize the global supply chain profit. Under some circumstances the manufacturer should allow parallel imports and under others should prevent them. Through a Stackelberg game we solve for the optimal pricing strategy in each scenario. We then find in one extension that when the number of parallel importers increases, the optimal authorized price gap should narrow, but the prices and quantities of parallel imports may rise or fall. In another extension, we. nd that when the manufacturer has other means—such as monitoring dealers, differentiating designs, and unbundling warranties—to contain parallel imports, the authorized price gap can widen {{as a function of the}} effectiveness of nonpricing controls. In summary, parallel imports may help the manufacturer to extend the global reach of its product and even boost its global profit. If the manufacturer offers a discount version through its authorized dealers, it is running a high risk of confusing customers and tarnishing brand images. Parallel imports may cause similar concerns for the manufacturer, but unauthorized dealers are perceived as further removed from the manufacturer. Therefore, there is less risk of confusing consumers when parallel imports are channeled through unauthorized dealers. Furthermore, they are more nimble in diverting the product whenever their transshipment and marketing costs are small enough not to offset the authorized price gap and the valuation discount. This may explain why some manufacturers fiercely fight parallel imports, while others knowingly use this alternative channel.

The discussion here begins with the observation that post consumer textile waste remains a major obstacle in realising a model of sustainable fashion design and production however, amongst the millions of tonnes of textile and clothing sent to landfill each year there is little evidence of <b>authentic</b> luxury branded <b>goods</b> ending life as landfill. The sustainable fashion movement often support approaches such as fashion up-cycle, re-cycle and cradle to cradle solutions.

Albert agrees with this commentary but he also adds in harmony or agreement. Albert calls this harmony, consensio, itself a certain kind of movement within the human spirit. Albert fully agrees with Aristotle in the sense that friendship is a virtue. Albert relates the inherent metaphysical contentedness between friendship and moral goodness. Albert describes several levels of goodness; the useful (utile), the pleasurable (delectabile) and the <b>authentic</b> or unqualified <b>good</b> (honestum).

40|$|In 2009 the {{decision}} was made that from 2013 the only route onto the UK Nursing register would be through graduate programmes. This research problematises this decision, explores the discourses surrounding it and primarily questions whether the new standards for nurse education are a form of social (re) engineering? To do this it draws on both the conceptual tools of Pierre Bourdieu (field of practice, habitus and capital) (Bourdieu 1990) and on his three distinct levels of inquiry; the position of the field within other fields; mapping the objective structure of relations between positions occupied by those who occupy ‘legitimate’ forms of specific authority in the field; and by exploring the habitus of the agents. This is achieved by applying a layered approach of critical discourse analysis, to the examination of policy and professional text and to the stories of nurses as accessed through the use of online methodologies. The data reveals a picture of nurses engaged in definitional struggles influenced from both within and outside of the profession. Nursing and nurses are both surrounded by and contributing to complex, and on occasion, conflicting discourses. Nurses’ experiences are located between their affiliations to both externally declared expectations of quality and changing role, and their understood position as bedside carers, with graduate status perceived as educating nurses away from the bedside as the nature of what is <b>good</b> (<b>authentic)</b> nursing practice changes. The thesis concludes by recognising its place as further contribution to the discourses surrounding the move to an all graduate nursing profession and makes three recommendations: investment in an academic nursing community; a call for nursing to become a politically active/ effective profession; and action to counter the perception that the graduate nursing standards are creating a profession of uncaring and dispassionate nurses. ...|$|R

Therefore the Palace is not a mere reflection of a particular style: its construction relfects both ancient and more contemporary influences. Structural complexity is not only accentuated through interpolation of the façade into the colonnade and the arches of the Peristil, but through its partially plastered east portion of the façade. Although these multiple layers of plaster bear no artistic significance, it is yet important to study their construction, quality and methods of application, in order to define their significance in the broader context of building heritage. The stone and plaster surfaces of the Skočibučić – Lukaris Palace façade, prior to conservation-restauration work, reflected signs of deterioration that occured in the course of time, such as thick films, impurities, discolorations and layers of biological growths. The surface of the outer wall of the palace was covered with layers of plaster simulating the original stone construction of the colonnade of the Diocletian’s peristyle. The original portions of the façade plaster emulate joint pattern of the ancient stone blocks. The analysis of both plaster layers from the façade surface and the ancient stone block joints reveals high quality granulated lime plaster. The plaster is pigmented with darker shade of ocher, which, due to damaging chemical processes over the course of time, gradually faded into the shades of grey. Specific façade finish, reflected in the original pigmentation of the façade plaster, gives the palace its unique character and adds to its visual perception. Altered pigmentation and discoloration of the finish base was successfully removed by various methods of chemical cleaning, which both preserved and restored the original light ocher shade of the façade and its portions that were under atmospheric influences. Using the specific method of desalinization, that is, the clay compresses and cellulose pulp, the traces of salt were successfully removed from the inner and outer layers of plaster. All portions of the façade detached from its base, as well as the critical zones around fissures, were stabilized using the method of injection. Reconstruction plaster, possessing the quality of granular calibration and filler similar to the original one, successfully served its primary purpose. Having successfully replaced the original, it also created the <b>authentic</b> copy <b>good</b> enough to meet visual aesthetic and artistic criteria...|$|R
