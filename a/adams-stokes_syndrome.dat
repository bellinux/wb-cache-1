50|$|It is used {{to treat}} heart block and episodes of <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> that are not caused by {{ventricular}} tachycardia or fibrillation, in emergencies for cardiac arrest until electric shock can be administered, for bronchospasm occurring during anesthesia, and as an adjunct {{in the treatment of}} hypovolemic shock, septic shock, low cardiac output (hypoperfusion) states, congestive heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.|$|E
50|$|The first {{treatment}} application against trypanosomiasis {{was tested}} in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony potassium tartrate started in 1913. After {{the introduction of}} antimony (V) containing complexes like sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, the use of antimony potassium tartrate was phased out. After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony potassium tartrate could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony potassium tartrate had severe side effects such as <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, the use of antimony based treatments fell out of use.|$|E
5000|$|Stokes-Adams {{syndrome}} (alternative eponyms include <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome,</b> Gerbezius-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes {{syndrome and}} Gerbec-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome) is a periodic fainting spell {{in which there}} is a periodic onset and offset of blockage of heart due to disorder of heart rhythm that may last for seconds, hours, days, or even weeks before the conduction returns. Named after two Irish physicians, Robert Adams (1791 - 1875) and William Stokes (1804 - 1877), the first description of the syndrome was published in 1717 by the Carniolan physician of Slovene descent Marko Gerbec, which was 44 years after its publication quoted by Giovanni Battista Morgagni. It is characterised by decrease in cardiac output and loss of consciousness due to a transient arrhythmia. For example, bradycardia due to complete heart block.|$|E
40|$|The electrocardiograms and salient {{clinical}} features of seven patients with electrocar-diographic evidence {{of various types}} of bilateral bundle-branch block (BBBB) have been presented. When the complexes change in form and the P-R interval varies, the mechanisms are usually best interpreted by using the concepts of first degree, second degree, and third degree bundle-branch block with or without block in the higher conduction system. The etiology of BBBB in many cases is idiopathic fibrosis of both bundles. The diagnosis of BBBB by ECG is important because of its relation to the subsequent development of complete heart block or <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome,</b> or both. In this series five of seven patients with BBBB had <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> and three of seven had complete heart block. ADDITIONAL INDEXING WORDS: Adams-Stokes syndrom...|$|E

40|$|A case of {{congenital}} anieurysmal defect of the ventricular septumi {{is reported}} {{which appears to}} be unique in that this lesion was the only significant finding at autopsy. The patient had evidence of auriculoventricular block for a period of 26 years, at first partial and then complete. She succumbed at the age of 47 to a series of Adams-Stokes attacks which were demonstrated to be set off by parox-ysmal ventricular flutter followed byr ventricular tachy (caridia and ventricular standstill. Pertinent literature is briefly reviewed. T HE FOLLOWING case is conisidered worthy of recording since it appears to be the only one which we can find on record where an aneurysmal defect of the ventricular septum was the sole significant anatomic lesion found at autopsy. It demon-strates that ventricular flutter, unsuspected without cardiographic evidence, may precipi-tate the Adams-Stokes type of syncope. PREVIOUS LITERATURE Aneurysm of the Ventricular Septum. Because of its presumed lack of clinical significance, little has been written on the subject of anetu-rysm of the ventricular septum. Abbott, in Osler's Modern Medicine, 1 described the path-ologic condition briefly avid reviewed the origi-nal studies of Mall. 2 In, 1938 Lev and Saphir' published two cases and reviewed 70 cases which had been reported in the literature.

Among 43 patients monitored until symptoms appeared, non cardiogenic causes were confirmed in 20 of 22 patients because the recording showed normal rhythm during symptoms. Fifteen of 21 patients with a significant arrhythmia during an asymptomatic 24 hour recording later had the same arrhythmia during symptoms.

40|$|Background: Marcus Gerbezius, a {{distinguished}} Slovenian physician and scientist from {{the turn of}} the 17 th to the 18 th Century, published in the year 1717 an article in the annual journal of the German Academy of Natural Scientists in Halle, in which he described a patient with a clinical presentation of extreme bradycardia due to a complete atrioventricular block. Methods: methodology of history of medicine, analysis of archival materials, documents, and various publications. Results: Presentation of the life and work of Marcus Gerbezius, emphasizing the significance of his pioneering discovery of what is known today as <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> Conclusion: The article by Gerbezius was published almost 50 years before Morgagni’s, and about 150 years before Adams’ or Stokes’ articles on the same subject; therefore the name of Gerbezius {{should be included in the}} eponym name of the disorder “Syndrome Gerbezius-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes” – Syndrome GMAS. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Paroxysmal atrio-ventricular block (PAVB) {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} most {{important}} mechanisms by which <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> is precipitated. To evaluate the pathophysiology of PAVB, clinical and electrophysiological studies were performed in 23 electrocardiographically documented patients (pts). These cases were divided into 3 groups according to the site of the block: supra-His (AH) group, 6 pts; intra-His (HH') group, 8 pts; and infra-His (HV) group, 9 pts. The 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal or slightly abnormal in 12 pts (52. 5 %). Atrioventricular block (AVB) and intraventricular conduction disturbance were more frequent in the HH' and HV groups than in the AH group (p< 0. 05). ECG monitoring also showed transient second degree AVB in 4 / 6 of the AH, 8 / 8 of the HH' and 8 / 9 of the HV groups. PAVB was initiated by slowing of the atrial rate in 5 / 6 of the AH group, but by rate increase or a premature atrial contraction in 16 / 17 of the HH' and HV groups. The duration of ventricular standstill was longer in the HH' or HV groups (7. 6 ± 3. 2 sec.) than in the AH (4. 7 ± 1. 4 sec) group. Ventricular escape terminated PAVB in 5 / 8 of the HH' and 5 / 9 of the HV groups. The administration of positive chronotropic agents such as atropine and isoproternol caused PAVB or syncope in 4 pts, 2 pts each from the HH' and HV groups. Implantation of an artificial pacemaker was needed to prevent <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> in all cases. In the electrophysiological studies, rapid atrial pacing was able to reveal PAVB within the critical zone of the pacing rate (PAVB zone) in 7 / 16 (43. 8 %) pts, who were mostly those of the HH' or HV groups whose spontaneous attacks were preceded by an increase of the atrial rate. These results suggest that PAVB occurs according to different mechanisms depending on the site of the block. In the HH' and HV groups PAVB was initiated by an increase of the atrial rate not only in ?spontaneous episodes but also in the electrophysiological study. Repetitive concealed conduction might play a role in the initiation of PAVB in HH' and HV groups...|$|E
40|$|Mechnisms {{responsible}} for the occurrence of <b>Adams-Stokes</b> <b>syndrome</b> in 85 Patients with atrioventricular (AV) block were studied through the examination of their clinical symptom and course, documented ECG findings and electrophysiologic approaches. Patients with 1 st and 2 nd degree AV block in the His-Purkinje system had {{a high incidence of}} syncopal sttack (8 of 10 patients) and this incidence was alomost equal with that in patients with 3 rd　degree of AV block in the His-Puurije system. Twentyfive 0 f 61 patients (41 %) with 3 rd degree AV block had history of syncope, the mechanisms of which were nor revwaled other than in 3 cases with a history of paroxysmal AV block, 2 cases of block in block and 3 cases of Torsade de Pointes. There was no significant differrence between in patients with and without a history of Adams- Stokes attack in parameters of subsidiary pacemaker automaticity (heart rate of escape rhythm nad automaticity recovery time) in patients with 3 rd degree AV blok. Paroxysmal AV block in the His-Purkinje system, associated with phase 3 and/or phase 4 block, has been suggested have a determinant role in the mechanism for Adams-Stokes syndromes in the stage of transitional phase of 1 st and 2 nd to 3 rd degree of AV block...|$|E
40|$|AUTHORS ’ YNOPSIS. Mechanisms of {{clinically}} known {{varieties of}} second degree A- V block were studied in isolated rabbit hearts, utilizing ultramicroelectrode techniques. Progressive A- V conduction delay in Wenckebach phenomenon was due mainly to depressed conduction within the A- V node, while Mobitz type 2 block {{was due to}} either block in or below His bundle or concealed re-excitation in the A- Vjunction. Two lecels of block were demonstrated both in forward and retrograde A- V transmission. Delayed conduction between the atria and the ven-tricles was recognized by early workers (Wenckebach, 1899; Hay, 1906), and specifically identified by Wenckebach in 1899. According to Wenckebach, gradual prolongation of the a-c interval of the jugular pulse with the eventual {{dropping out of the}} pulse was due to impaired atrioventricular conduc-tion. A second type was also observed by the same author without preceding a-c prolongation. Here the dropped beat was considered a result of decreased ventricular excitability. Following the introduction of electrocardio-graphy, Mobitz (1924) described a progressive prolongation of the P-R interval until a ventricular beat was dropped (type l), as well as another type of second degree block in which the P-R interval remained constant before the dropped beat (type 2) (Mobitz, 1924). The first type (Wenckebach 1 and Mobitz 1) has been commonly called the “Wencke-bach phenomenon”, and the second type, Mobitz type 2 block. Both Mobitz (1924) and Scherf (1929) recognized several variations of these phenomena but did not offer a precise explanation. Katz and Pick (1956) attributed type 1 to a moderate pro-longation of both the absolute and relative refractory phase of the A-V junctional tissues, while type 2 was identified with an increase of the absolute refractory phase.
