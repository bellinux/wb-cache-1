40|$|AbstractAir in the {{epidural}} {{space is}} called pneumorachis. The usual mechanism of pneumorachis is <b>air</b> <b>diffusion</b> from the mediastinal tissue layers through the inter-vertebral foramen. Alternatively, air can diffuse directly after spine traumas (e. g., blunt deceleration with vertebral dislocation) or medical procedures. Several mechanisms could explain pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis after cocaine sniffing. Passive apnea and/or cough that occur after sniffing can cause intra alveolar hyper-pressure, {{which is responsible}} for alveolar rupture and <b>air</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Another mechanism is alveolar wall fragility and rupture induced by repeated cocaine sniffing, in turn causing <b>air</b> <b>diffusion</b> to the mediastinum, sub-cutaneous tissues and the epidural space. The diagnosis is usually made on Chest tomography scan. Management consists in close monitoring {{in the intensive care unit}} to detect aggravation of pneumomediastinum and pneumorachis, which would require surgical management. Supplemental nasal oxygen can be given to accelerate nitrogen washout. We present a case of a 28 years old male who presented to the emergency department for chest pain directly after sniffing cocaine. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed pneumomediastinum, pneumorachis and sub-cutaneous emphysema.

In this paper, a direct model based on explicit geometry of stacked products in boxes was developed and used to study the diffusion, convection and adsorption of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) gas in cool stores for apple fruit. The discrete element method was employed to generate random stacking of spherical products in a box. A three-dimensional finite volume-based computational fluid dynamics model was developed, verified and used to study the distribution and partitioning of the 1 -MCP gas inside loaded container.
