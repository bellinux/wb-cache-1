25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit of a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E

During the 2010–11 season, he expressed some regret, admitting, [...] " [...] probably would do it a little bit different ... But I'm happy with my decision." [...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on the other foot <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 26, Bottomley {{became the}} company's chairman. His advance in the {{business}} world was attracting wider notice, and in 1887 he was invited by the Liberal Party in Hornsey to be their candidate in a parliamentary by-election. He accepted, and although defeated, fought a strong campaign which won him a congratulatory letter from William Gladstone. His business affairs were proceeding less serenely; he quarrelled with his partner Douglas MacRae, and the two decided to separate. Bottomley described the [...] "Quixotic impulse" [...] that led him to let MacRae divide the assets: [...] "He was a printer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> journalist—but he took the papers and left me the printing works".|$|E
500|$|Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became {{attracted}} to theatre {{at a young}} age, and began performing with a troupe known as [...] "The Penders" [...] {{from the age of}} six. After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, he toured the country as a stage performer, and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s. He initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as Blonde Venus (1932) and She Done Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown for his appearances in romantic comedy and screwball comedy films such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Along with the later Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> Male War Bride (1949); these films are frequently cited as among the all-time great comedy films. Having established himself as a major Hollywood star, he was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None but the Lonely Heart (1944).|$|E

500|$|Planet of the Titans was {{expected}} to be filmed in the United Kingdom in order to keep production costs low. In July 1976, Jerry Isenberg was assigned to be executive producer of the new film and British writers Bryant and Scott were hired in September. The duo had no science fiction writing experience, but had written the films Don't Look Now (1973) and Joseph Andrews (1977). Roddenberry defended the hiring of the pair, saying [...] "I'm very excited about some of the ideas they've come up with. The concept that only a science fiction writer can write science fiction motion pictures is ridiculous. Look at me. I came up with Star Trek, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> dramatic writer. I wrote for TV." [...] Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Their 20-page treatment was submitted the following month. It was entitled Planet of the Titans and was received favourably by Diller and fellow executive Michael Eisner. The writers were told by Paramount to proceed to script on October 6.|$|E
500|$|They were on {{the road}} again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road. Argyle came away with all three points {{courtesy}} of goals from Wright-Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner. [...] "It was pretty special <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little choked up," [...] he said. [...] "It was a special night. When I moved to the States 20 years ago, I didn't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans, and I can't thank them enough. Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion." [...] Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park {{for the first time since}} his departure in November 2007 in the club's next game, and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2–0 victory, with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat. Argyle played out an entertaining 0–0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later, but it did little to help in their battle against relegation, still five points away from safety. They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2–1 win, coming from behind with second-half goals from Mason, and an injury time header from Wright-Phillips. In order to stay up, Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games, but they went down 2–0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side, which left them four points adrift with four games left. A solitary goal from Watford's Heidar Helguson dealt Argyle's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road, but vice-captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game. [...] "We'll be upbeat, and we'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday." ...|$|E

He settled on the name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker: [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} jazz <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> big fan of ... the way he sang, when he moved into mainstream singing. He had this really fragile vocal style—this really, broken, close-up and intimate style. The name is kind of just an ode to Chet Baker and the mood of music he used to play—something I would like to at least pay homage to in my own music." [...] Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother's Motown albums and his father's [...] "chilled out Ibiza CDs".|$|E

[...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!'
