Monitoring-based project control requires meaningful indicators and an evaluation system. Ultimately, options must be available for stopping, limiting, or reversing any undesired developments.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into {{an outbreak of}} food poisoning caused by Clostridium perfringens showed evidence of poor food handling by catering staff. The reasons behind this were explored by interviewing catering staff, analysing shifts and rotas, and looking at staff vacancies. Morale was low because of staff shortages resulting from a long term recruitment problem. In consequence staff were working double shifts and often for weeks on end without a day off. The reasons for the recruitment problem included the difficulty of recruiting semiskilled labour from a middle class area, low wages, lack of management support, and the poor image of the hospital {{as a place of}} work. Similar factors affect the recruitment and retention of ancillary staff nationally. The NHS has a poor record as an employer of ancillary staff, paying lower wages than other organisations for equivalent posts. Competitive tendering has further worsened the position of ancillary staff, with the result that good quality of care and service has often not been achieved. The NHS Review, with its emphasis on quality of care, makes no mention of ancillary staff.

50|$|The leading {{judgment}} {{was given by}} Lord Mance, with whom Lords Hope, Scott and Collins concurred. The principles upon which the court should interpret such a document were held to be well-established and clear. The court should look at the document as a whole rather than focus on a single phrase, including any background information {{which would have been}} available to the parties at the time the contract was agreed. Applying this principle, it was held that the court should look not at the final sentence in Clause 7.6 in isolation but at {{the context in which the}} sentenced appeared and at the scheme of the STD as a whole. Clause 7.6 appeared in the STD in the context of an assumption of a situation in which Sigma had enough assets to cover at least its secured creditors, not a situation requiring the application of priorities between creditors. The final sentence of Clause 7.6, it was held, was not intended to prioritise creditors whose debts fell due during the realisation period over other creditors. It was also held to be improbable that commercial parties would contemplate that priority would be conferred to some creditors over others by the fortuitous timing of whose debts fell due during the realisation period. Clause 7.6 was an <b>ancillary</b> <b>provision</b> which did not override the trustee’s absolute discretion as to how assets were to be realised. The reasonable person’s understanding of Clause 7.6 was aided by a clear basic scheme that debts arising during the realisation period were to be part of the short term pool of creditors with the assets to be distributed equally amongst all the creditors at the discretion of the trustee i.e. pari passu.|$|R
40|$|No worker {{should have}} to suffer a life {{altering}} or fatal illness {{for the sake of}} a job, yet thousands of workers have died or developed a disabling illness from occupational exposure to silica. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not updated the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for silica since 1971. The current PEL for respirable crystalline silica in the construction industry is 250 mppcf/ (%SiO 2 + 5) TWA which is adjusted per the amount of silica in the sample. This exposure limit is known to cause silicosis, a disease developed from silica exposure. The construction industry uses multiple processes and materials that contain and generate hazardous silica dust. OSHA has proposed a silica standard that reduces the PEL and provides <b>ancillary</b> <b>provisions</b> to protect the health and safety of workers. Engineering controls are proven to reduce the exposure of silica during certain construction activities. The OSHA has developed a table titled ‘Exposure Control Methods for Selected Construction Operations’ which lists controls that can be used to certain silica generating activities. In the proposed standard, the control methods in this table can be followed in place of sampling. Personal exposure monitoring was conducted to determine the effectiveness of engineering controls on certain silica-generating activities listed in OSHA’s table ‘Exposure Control Methods for Selected Construction Operations. ’ Eight out of 10 (80 %) of the samples collected in this pilot study revealed crystalline silica exposures below the proposed PEL and 2 samples (20 %) revealed both sample weighted and 8 hour time weighted average concentrations above the proposed PEL. While the number of samples in this pilot study are limited, these results suggest that further evaluation should be performed to ensure workers in the construction industry are adequately protected...|$|E
40|$|How is EU {{criminal}} {{legislative competence}} regulated after the Lisbon Treaty? The European Union {{has always had}} powers which affect national criminal law. Classic internal market judgments consider whether national criminal law measures are justified restrictions of freedom of movement. The Union s direct legislative powers in this field have developed more slowly through international agreements, Treaty revision and the case law of the Court of Justice on implied powers. This study asks what powers have been conferred on the Union {{in the field of}} substantive criminal law and how the exercise of its powers may be reviewed after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The questions raise {{a wide range of issues}} relevant to EU criminal law, but also to EU constitutional, administrative and institutional law. A state-centric view of European integration holds that EU criminal law powers were framed to preserve core areas of national sovereignty. Scholarship in the field of EU criminal law is often ambivalent or critical of centralized powers in this field. Addressing the Union s competence creep was at the heart of constitutional reforms incorporated by the Lisbon Treaty. This sentiment explains some unusual features of the field after those revisions: the emergency brake, the special position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark, limits to Court of Justice jurisdiction, the unanimity requirement for states participating in the European Public Prosecutor s office, more sensitive ex ante subsidiarity control, and limiting express criminal law powers to directives. Nevertheless, these limits are constructed from the reference point of EU institutional law. The survey of those elements shows that the foundations of these structures are unreliable. If codification was intended to limit creeping competence, the framers have failed. Case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union after December 2009 suggests that Article 83 TFEU, or even the complete set of legal bases in the Union s area of freedom, security and justice, is not an exhaustive codification of the Union s criminal law powers. The central question in the calculus, the Court s rules on choice of legal bases, has been susceptible to creative drafting and suffers from weak judicial oversight. Legislative practice suggests that the new safeguards can be sidelined in this process. Thus, the central, and important debates in EU criminal law on the meaning of specific concepts like minimum rules, what crimes can be included in the 83 (1) list, and how the European Public Prosecutor should operate may be gradually sidelined by the incoming tide, or at least creeping competence in other estuaries. At the same time, Member States cling to pre-Lisbon practices that restrict the exercise of competence but which seem disconnected from the post-Lisbon legal framework. A detailed examination of this field finds anomalies in the external relations law of the Union, where pragmatism prevails. Small elements that have criminal law implications may be included within Union powers where express internal competence is doubtful. In others, declarations of competence appear to reserve powers to the Member States that the Union could lawfully exercise. The Court now accepts <b>ancillary</b> <b>provisions</b> with criminal law relevance in mainstream measures that do not offer the safeguards of the express criminal law provisions. This is demonstrated by analogy with the case law on issues in the area of freedom, security and justice. Thus, social security coordination measures can be based on the free movement provisions, criminal law obligations may be part of the common commercial policy, and agreements on the treatment of suspected pirates may properly be concluded as part of an agreement that is exclusively Common Foreign and Security Policy. The Court even allows the EU legislature to predetermine the success of any legal challenge because it relies primarily on textual evidence in recitals to determine the aim of the legislature. Thus, measures establishing information systems and exchange mechanisms concerning road traffic offences are measures of transport policy, not measures concerning cooperation in criminal matters, and data retention is an internal market measure. These judgments have surprised academics, national governments, and even EU institutions legal services. Questions also arise as to the effectiveness of the new safeguards even when they are not circumvented. The emergency brake may lead to consensualism, but it is not pulled when a Member State position that is presented as a red line is ignored. The pleadings of the opt-out states in key cases suggest that national governments are not policing their opt-out. National parliaments rarely raise formal subsidiarity concerns. Intervention is rare even if an EU proposal raises constitutional issues and overrules significant policy choices in national criminal law. National policy choices may be legitimate even if the Union has the technical capacity to overrule them. National criminal law scholars often argue that integration in criminal law will come at a high personal cost to the victims of that policy unless appropriate safeguards are developed. The Court of Justice has struggled to distinguish between criminal and civil rules in the European Union constitutional system. Instead, it has developed institutional safeguards that require, as far as possible, democratic decision-making. It has also begun to use fundamental rights, and in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights, to test the legality of Union action. Thus, whilst its standard of review has been criticized in the past, the findings suggest the Court may be better placed to cope with the increasing trend to treat de facto penal law as administrative rules than the corpus of EU judicial review literature suggests. This research has used standard legal research methods but combines these with an element of the law in action in the field of EU transparency law. During the research, it became clear that the key research questions required material that had not been published. In order to study the drafting processes, the study sought and obtained series of documents that were not originally released for public use. These include legislative negotiation documents, legal opinions of the legal services, and even the pleadings of Member States and EU institutions in key constitutional law cases. One document was released through litigation; another is pending litigation. Both cases raise novel points in transparency law that may have wide-reaching consequences on the nature of the EU criminal legislative process. To what extent should it be open to public scrutiny? Should the Union consider strictly defined conferral or procedural limits to the enumerated powers? The history of constitutional limits is that they are circumvented at the first opportunity when a crisis presents itself. It is possible to conceive some which are more difficult to ignore than those which appear to have buckled under the strain of post-Lisbon practice. However, when limits are drafted in a strict form, this can later cause constitutional contortions that call into question the rule of law. Instead, the present criminal competence control has been effectively proceduralized: particular steps must be taken, but their review is likely to be unintrusive or sympathetic. More legal research is required in the pre-legislative stage, even to understand the nature of competence control. Debates in poorly studied legislative forums are likely to shed great light on the Union s constitution: what happens. Euroopan unionin toimivalta ja sen sääntely kuuluvat eurooppaoikeuden keskeisiin tutkimuskysymyksiin. Rikosoikeuden alalla Unionin toimivallan katsottiin pitkän olleen rajallista. Lissabonin sopimuksessa pyrittiin täsmentämään Unionin toimivaltaa jäsenvaltioihin nähden. Samalla kehitettiin uusia valvontakeinoja, kuten kansallisten parlamenttien toissijaisuusarviointia. Tämä tutkimus tarkastelee, kuinka Euroopan unionin rikosoikeudellinen toimivalta määritetään, sekä kuinka tätä toimivaltaa valvotaan EU-tasolla Lissabonin sopimuksen tultua voimaan 1. 12. 2009. Unionilla on toimivalta säätää rikosten ja seuraamusten määrittelyä koskevista vähimmäissäännöistä Euroopan Unionista Tehdyn Sopimuksen 83 artiklan puitteissa. Nykyisten säännösten syntyhistoria viittaa sopimusosapuolten tahtoon rajata tätä toimivaltaa sekä sisällön että maantieteellisen ulottuvuuden näkökulmasta. Tutkimus väittää, että sekä rajausyritykset että toimivallan valvontakeinot ovat monessa suhteessa epäonnistuneet. Toisaalta oikeusjärjestys mahdollistaa joustavia ja lainsäätäjän tarpeita palvelevia ratkaisuja. Yksi keskeinen virhearvio liittyy Euroopan unionin tuomioistuimen oikeuskäytäntöön, joka tarkastelee oikeusperustan valintaa. Tämä oikeuskäytäntö on tunnetusti vaikeaselkoista ja ristiriitaista. Tutkimus väittää, että instituutiot pystyvät halutessaan luonnostelemaan lakiehdotuksia tarkoitushakuisesti siten, että SEUT 83 artiklan rajoitukset voidaan sivuuttaa. EU-tuomioistuin painottaa lainsäätäjän itsensä ilmoittamia tarkoitusperiä, eikä usein valvo oikeusperustan valintaa kovinkaan kriittisesti. Tehokas valvonta edellyttää instituutioiden ja jäsenvaltioiden suurempaa aktiivisuutta tuomioistuinasioissa. Arkistoista pyydetyt aiemmin julkaisemattomat valmistelutyöt viittaavat erityisesti Neuvoston oikeuspalvelun merkittävään rooliin unionin lainsäädäntötyössä. Kun lainsäädäntöehdotus on oikein muotoiltu, on oikeusperustan kiistäminen EU-tuomioistuimessa haastavaa. Tämä on aiheuttanut voimakasta kritiikkiä erityisesti Iso-Britanniassa, jonka hallitus on aktiivisesti mutta pääsääntöisesti epäonnisesti puolustanut oikeuttaan jäädä rikosoikeudellisen yhteistyön ulkopuolelle. EU-tuomioistuimen on usein katsottu suhtautuvan pidättyvästi lainsäädäntöä koskeviin kumoamiskanteisiin. Tämä johti Lissabonin sopimuksen yhteydessä vahvistamaan kansallisten parlamenttien oikeuksia toissijaisuusvalvontaan. Tutkimus osoittaa, että kansalliset parlamentit ovat pääsääntöisesti suhtautuneet pidättyväisesti uusiin oikeuksiinsa. Esimerkiksi eduskunta on katsonut, ettei kansallisten parlamenttien uusi toissijaisuusvalvontaoikeus usein tuo lisäarvoa. Sen sijaan EU-tuomioistuin on puolestaan antanut tuomioita, jotka saattavat johtaa tiukempaan linjaan. Sen uudet ratkaisut viittaavat suurempaan valmiuteen tarkastella myös EU-lainsäädännön suhteellisuutta...|$|E
30|$|The {{operations}} of PtG plants discussed in Sections  3.1 and 3.2 {{rely on the}} price signals in the energy market to compensate the high investment costs of PtG plants, while the results are not optimistic due to their high investment costs and high electricity prices in the energy market. In addition to the energy market, ancillary service markets such as regulation and reserve markets could provide additional revenues for PtG plants. Generally, the price for ancillary services, especially the service price for providing regulation service, is comparable to or even higher than the energy market prices.

A data-driven multi-zonal thermal response model is formulated and fit to EnergyPlus simulation data from a Department of Energy Small Office Reference Commercial Building for the months of June, July and August. When validated and tested against EnergyPlus simulation data, the thermal response model performs well. The thermal response model is then used in a co-optimization of energy and <b>ancillary</b> <b>provision</b> for a small office building with a variable air volume system from [9] using summer wholesale electricity and ancillary services prices from ISO-NE. Under six different price cases, the individual small office building provides maximum hourly regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 3. 2 and 4. 4 kW respectively and daily total regulation and spinning reserve capacities of 51 and 46 kW respectively. When scaled up over similar building stock in New England, small office buildings can provide up to 9. 5 % of ISO-NE's daily regulation requirement and 8 % of the daily spinning reserves requirement. From an economic perspective, a small office building's potential summer ancillary services' revenues are not sufficient to drive investment in installation of a building automation system, variable air volume system and associated metering. However, buildings may invest in the necessary equipment for energy cost reductions {{and to participate in}} other demand response programs. Increasing building participation rates in ancillary services markets requires addressing the principal-agent problem, building-specific concerns such as program controllability and convenience and targeted policies aimed at increasing availability of clear aggregator-enabled building participation avenues. by Nora Xu.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} variable energy resources in modern electric power systems requires additional flexibility in <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provision</b> to maintain reliable and efficient grid operations. However, full recognition and appropriate compensation of this flexibility {{is difficult to}} ensure within current power market designs due to rigidities in service definitions and requirements.

30|$|Alternative {{approaches}} to scaling the battery are also possible, as explained previously. The chosen approach of scaling to equal capacity {{ensures that the}} battery can provide {{the same amount of}} work as the pumped hydropower station, thus allowing for longer term balancing and <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provision.</b> However, this is at odds with typical sizing of battery storage. A utility-scale battery with a storage capacity of 9.6  GWh would, according to common E 2 P rules, have a much higher capacity than the pumped hydropower storage. It would, therefore, be able to provide short-term balancing services to a far greater extent than assumed for the pumped hydropower storage. It was, therefore, decided to investigate a utility-scale battery sized to generate merely the same annual output (MWh/a) as the pumped hydropower store. In this case, the number of annual full charging cycles for the battery is the decisive parameter. This implies, however, that longer term balancing and ancillary services would have to be excluded from the comparison in this case.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks for an energy producer is represented by the optimal bidding on energy markets.

40|$|Abstract – The {{rational}} buyer procedure {{provides the}} competitive procurement of capacity-based ancillary services (AS) in unbundled markets by the Independent Grid Operator (IGO). The capacity-based AS are prioritized {{in order of}} ascending response times. Prioritization allows substitutability of the AS by automatically making the unused capacity of a higher priority AS usable for any lower priority AS without the need of submitting additional offers. We develop an efficient scheme for the rational buyer procedure for the acquisition of the prioritizable capacity-based AS. The scheme allows the simultaneous determination of the successful offers in the multiauction procedure through the effective deployment of discrete programming notions and the exploitation of the structural characteristics of the formulation. A key feature is the incorporation of physical constraints such as capacity and interzonal constraints. The use of bounding techniques combined with procedures for the quick detection of infeasible combinations of the offer prices and the identification of avoidable calculations leads to reducing the computational burden. The effectiveness and computational efficiency of the scheme are illustrated with representative numerical results including case studies based on t he IEEE 118 -bus network.

Apart from the ubiquitous and overarching common law and the Cross-Border Insolvency Act, Australian law relevant to cross-border insolvency includes the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ss 580 – 81, s 583 and s 601 CL (the <b>ancillary</b> liquidation <b>provision).</b> Currently, the procedures overlap in a complex and confusing way, with cases potentially falling through gaps in the law and important provisions being overlooked. The end result for the administration of cross-border insolvency cases is incongruity and inconvenience, with added cost and complication. The {{time has come for}} a rethink and redesign of Australia’s international insolvency framework. The revised framework should include reconceptualisation of the basis for international insolvency cooperation, with incorporation of the Model Law standards as the basic threshold for insolvency assistance and provision for enhanced cooperation and assistance in certain circumstances. The conceptual redesign should also tackle some of the current limitations of the Cross-Border Insolvency Ac...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIncreased {{attention}} to CO 2 capture operability motivates study of CO 2 capture within a full electricity system where different operating configurations (no capture, inflexible capture, flexible capture) {{can be studied}} alongside competing generating technologies in current and future electric grids. A least-cost electricity system dispatch model is created as a mixed integer linear program using GAMS software and used to perform such analysis, specifically examining flexible post-combustion amine scrubbing for energy and <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provision.</b> A projected 2020 Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid with substantial wind and energy storage is modeled to quantify flexible capture capabilities for $ 0 – 80 /tCO 2 and $ 3 – 8 /MMBTU natural gas. Flexible capture is found to reduce electricity dispatch costs by responding to variability in electricity demand. Given sufficient system response time, the ability to reduce capture load (energy requirement) allows facilities to provide substantial low-cost reserve capacity, and units with capture operating below 100 % load can offer the ability to increase capture load for unexpected increases in supply such as from wind. The cost and reliability (ancillary) service benefits of flexible capture are found to increase with CO 2 and natural gas price because units become more economical to operate. Furthermore, the existence of grid-scale energy storage does not significantly detract from the value of flexible capture...|$|R
40|$|Dispersed Generation (DG) {{is often}} {{connected}} to the network with power-electronic interfaces for a proper coupling with the distribution networks (e. g. photovoltaic panels, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, etc.). Such power electronics can perform functions other than the supply of real power thus representing an opportunity to increase the value of DG as provider of new additional services. In particular, the innovation and the improvements in electronic devices allow using DG for the <b>provision</b> of <b>ancillary</b> services (voltage control, power quality disturbance compensation, and so on), representing, in this way, an interesting chance {{to improve the quality}} of the service. For these reasons, specific planning tools for the optimal siting and sizing of DG should be adopted to take into consideration the multiple and contrasting goals that the Distribution System Operators (DSO) strive to achieve. In the paper the optimal siting and sizing of DG connected through electronic interfaces is performed by means of multiobjective programming and an Îµ-constrained technique is used for the solution of the problem. Particular attention is paid to the modelling of electronic interfaces in order to obtain the required <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provision.</b> Simulation results on a test system demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology as well as the advantages obtained by the use of electronic interfaces in comparison to solutions employing electric generators directly coupled to the distribution network...|$|R

According to the Charter, {{the aims of the}} Institute included “the promotion of the study in Italy of English language, literature, art, history, philosophy and institutions”; “the formation and maintenance in Florence of a General Library of books illustrating English and Italian culture”; and “the promotion of a good understanding between Italians and English-speaking people by providing opportunities for intellectual and social intercourse; and, as <b>ancillary</b> thereto, the <b>provision</b> of opportunities for English-speaking Students to study Italian language, literature, art, history, philosophy and institutions".|$|R
50|$|Modern {{military}} engineering {{can be divided}} into three main tasks or fields: combat engineering, strategic support, and ancillary support. Combat engineering is associated with engineering on the battlefield. Combat engineers are responsible for increasing mobility {{on the front lines of}} war such as digging trenches and building temporary facilities in war zones. Strategic support is associated with providing service in communication zones such as the construction of airfields and the improvement and upgrade of ports, roads and railways communication. <b>Ancillary</b> support includes <b>provision</b> and distribution of maps as well as the disposal of unexploded warheads. Military engineers construct bases, airfields, roads, bridges, ports, and hospitals. During peacetime before modern warfare, military engineers took the role of civil engineers by participating in the construction of civil-works projects. Nowadays, military engineers are almost entirely engaged in war logistics and preparedness.Combat engineers clear routes, repair airfields and harbours, bridge rivers all at top speed and often under fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} to high penetration {{of renewable energy}} sources brings about problems related to the security and reliability of the electric power system. For this reason, EU countries are considering extending participation in the <b>provision</b> of <b>ancillary</b> services to distributed generators. Grid-connected Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are a promising technology for enabling this transition. Besides the research efforts to regulate and integrate BESS into the existing power systems, several studies have introduced improvements in BESS control for <b>ancillary</b> services <b>provision.</b> In this paper, {{attention is focused on}} primary control reserve (PCR). An introduction to the suitability of using BESS for PCR is followed by a literature review on BESS control strategies and controller models. Then the paper presents a model to investigate methods to increase BESS potential in providing PCR. The model is based on two different operating options: (i) variable-droop, meaning the droop-control is allowed to vary in time in order to avoid state of charge saturations and guarantee PCR availability; (ii) energy arbitrage, meaning that the battery is charged and discharged when economically favourable. A 1 MW/ 1 MWh BESS was simulated in MATLAB® Simulink® by implementing the two operating options via two fuzzy logic controllers that determine the droop and the arbitrage set points. The simulations rely on real metred data inputs (i. e. frequency and electricity prices) and demonstrate that both options improve BESS operations. Specifically, a study on the Italian case was applied to evaluate the feasibility of these applications in a real life scenario...|$|R
40|$|According to {{the type}} of <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provisioned,</b> {{operation}} mode of a power plant may change to part load operation. In this contribution, part load operation is understood as delivering a lower power output than possible at given ambient temperature because of gas turbine power output control. If it is economically justified, a power plant may operate in the part load mode for longer time. Part load performance of a newly built 80 Â MW combined cycle in Slovakia was studied in order to assess the possibilities for fuel savings. Based on online monitoring data three possibilities were identified: condensate preheating by activation of the currently idle hot water section; change in steam condensing pressure regulation strategy; and the most important gas turbine inlet air preheating. It may seem to be in contradiction with the well proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling, which has however been developed for boosting the gas turbine cycles in full load operation. On the contrary, in a combined cycle in the part load operation mode, elevated inlet air temperature does not affect the part load operation of gas turbines but it causes more high pressure steam to be raised in HRSG, which leads to higher steam turbine power output. As a result, less fuel needs to be combusted in gas turbines in order to achieve the requested combined cycle's power output. By simultaneous application of all three proposals, more than a 2 % decrease in the power plant's natural gas consumption can be achieved with only minor capital expenses needed.

40|$|With {{the devastation}} {{wrought by the}} 2008 'property market bubble' still fresh in the mind on one hand, and a spate of recent enthusiasm {{manifested}} in the 'rush to the property ladder' on the other, the newly enacted Directive 2014 / 17 seeks to strike a middle ground of reasonableness in the delicate and sensitive matter of the security granted by the buyer of a residential property. Against this background, the present contribution analyses, first and foremost, the norms of a regulatory nature introduced by the new EU piece of legislation and the attempt to shape a new category of consumer. Among these precepts, attention is particularly afforded to the principle, of a public nature, prescribing that the bank's assessment to grant a mortgage shall be prevailingly based {{on the ability of}} the mortgagor to repay the debt, rather than on the expected (but undemonstrated) burgeoning future value of the property. Furthermore, the discussion focuses on the private law principles introduced by the Directive. Among these is the onus lying on the bank to provide adequate information about the terms and conditions of the mortgage. More interestingly, the directive at stake derogates from, and goes beyond, the notion of prohibition of 'agreement of forfeiture' existing in some civil law jurisdictions. This novelty, the <b>ancillary</b> legal <b>provisions</b> of art 28 of Directive 2014 / 17 as well as their impact on the system of civil proceedings and foreclosure existing in each country, provide fertile ground for a legal and comparative analysis. Finally, the European Business Law Review is a law journal which is published by Kluwer. The prestige of the journal is confirmed by the fact that its publications and its authors appear in the most important legal data base in the Commonwealth, WestLaw...|$|R
30|$|Mass {{production}} and continual innovation {{has brought the}} cost of lithium-ion consumer batteries down 90 % over 16 years from 3185 $/kWh in 1995 to 320 $/kWh in 2011. Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric [28], U.S. Investment Bank Lazard [29] and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) [30] have confirmed the competitiveness of batteries with conventional peak plants for <b>ancillary</b> service <b>provision.</b> According to AECOM calculation report, energy storage paired with solar off-grid remote locations is 120 $/MWh which is half {{of the cost of}} diesel-only conventional generation at 346 $/MWh [31]. According to a 2017 report, energy storage requirement for system adequacy in Australia under high renewable energy penetration of 75 % will be 105 GWh [32]. Under the assumption that the security requirement is met by batteries providing two hours of storage, the need for energy storage for adequacy is reduced by two thirds at 2030 under 52 % renewable integration [32]. Operational thermal and hydro/pumped hydro system generators are currently responsible for FCAS in NEM, with each service providers required to provide more than 1  MW capacity. There are over 1.5 GW of pumped hydro storage operating in NEM and no examples of CAES, Sodium-Sulphur or liquid metal technology installations. Most of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are in operation for off-grid customers in NEM. While projects like 10.4  MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) with 1.4  MW/ 5.3  MWh of lithium-ion battery storage are under construction for improved power quality and supply at a fringe-of-grid location in Queensland, still there is little deployment for battery storage specifically for FCAS. Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) projects over 3 GW of cumulative installed residential BESS asset by 2030 [33]. As with utility scale BESS assets, this represents an asset base of fully controllable generation and customer load that can provide critical reliability in a changing market. The existing market framework is not, however, well set up to extract energy, FCAS or demand response services from these assets, without the involvement of a retailer.|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{describe}} the baseline demographic data, clinical characteristics and HIV-incidence rates of a cohort {{at high risk}} for HIV infection in South Africa as well as the challenges experienced in establishing and maintaining the cohort. Methodology/Principle FINDINGS: Between August 2004 and May 2005 a cohort of HIV-uninfected women was established for the CAPRISA 002 Acute Infection Study, a natural history study of HIV- 1 subtype C infection. Volunteers were identified through peer-outreach. The cohort was followed monthly to determine HIV infection rates and clinical presentation of early HIV infection. Risk reduction counselling and male and female condoms were provided. After screening 775 individuals, a cohort of 245 uninfected high-risk women was established. HIV-prevalence at screening was 59. 6 % (95 % CI: 55. 9 % to 62. 8 %) posing a challenge in accruing HIV-uninfected women. The majority of women (78. 8 %) were self-identified as sex-workers with a median of 2 clients per day. Most women (95 %) reported more than one casual sexual partner in the previous 3 months (excluding clients) and 58. 8 % reported condom use in their last sexual encounter. Based on laboratory testing, 62. 0 % had a sexually transmitted infection at baseline. During 390 person-years of follow-up, 28 infections occurred yielding seroincidence rate of 7. 2 (95 % CI: 4. 5 to 9. 8) per 100 person-years. Despite the high mobility of this sex worker cohort retention rate after 2 years was 86. 1 %. High co-morbidity created challenges for <b>ancillary</b> care <b>provision,</b> both in terms of human and financial resources. Conclusions/Significance Challenges experienced were high baseline HIV-prevalence, lower than anticipated HIV-incidence and difficulties retaining participants. Despite challenges, we have successfully accrued this cohort of HIV-uninfected women with favourable retention, enabling us to study the natural history of HIV- 1 during acute HIV-infection. Our experiences provide lessons for others establishing similar cohorts, which will be key for advancing the vaccine and prevention research agenda in resource-constrained settings...|$|R
