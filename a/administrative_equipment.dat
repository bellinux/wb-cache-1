40|$|Many {{variations}} of conveyor, facility, and trailer designs {{are available to}} aid the human operator in manual materials handling (MMH). This thesis describes an investigation to determine which of four different designs used in trailer MMH place the least physical stress on the human operator when unloading materials. Each trailer MMH design was evaluated by the criteria of biomechanical loading, working posture, physiological measure, and subjective rating of exertion. These four methods were used to generate four dependent measures: L 5 /S 1 Compression Force, OWAS Action Category, mean heart rate, and Borg CR- 10 RPE. While no single assessment method provided a clear means for quantifying level differences in physical stress among MMH conditions, the methods employed furnished insight into which techniques and protocols might be useful in studying similar working situations. Based on relative sensitivity, ease of application, and <b>administrative</b> and <b>equipment</b> costs, the OWAS method was recommended as an assessment method useful for evaluating similar MMH work. The summary results of the four methods provided information to meet the experimental goals of this research and allowed conclusions to be drawn for the major areas of interest.

40|$|Background: The European Union (EU) {{supports}} North–South Partnerships {{and collaborative}} research projects through its Framework Programmes and Horizon 2020. There is limited {{research on how}} such projects can be harnessed to provide a structured platform for doctoral level studies {{as a way of}} strengthening health system research capacity in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the challenges of, and facilitating factors for, ‘nesting’ doctoral students in North–South collaborative research projects. The term nesting refers to the embedding of the processes of recruiting, supervising, and coordinating doctoral students in the overall research plan and processes. Design: This cross-sectional qualitative study was undertaken by the EU-funded QUALMAT Project. A questionnaire was implemented with doctoral students, supervisors, and country principal investigators (PIs), and content analysis was undertaken. Results: Completed questionnaires were received from nine doctoral students, six supervisors, and three country PIs (86 % responses rate). The doctoral students from SSA described high expectations about the input they would receive (<b>administrative</b> support, <b>equipment,</b> training, supervision). This contrasted with the expectations of the supervisors for proactivity and self-management on the part of the students. The rationale for candidate selection, and understandings of the purpose of the doctoral students in the project were areas of considerable divergence. There were some challenges associated with the use of the country PIs as co-supervisors. Doctoral student progress was at times impeded by delays in the release of funding instalments from the EU. The paper provides a checklist of essential requirements and a set of recommendations for effective nesting of doctoral students in joint North–South projects. Conclusion: There are considerable challenges to the effective nesting of doctoral students within major collaborative research projects. However, ways can be found to overcome them. The nesting process ultimately helped the institutions involved in this example to take better advantage of the opportunities that collaborative projects offer to foster North–South partnerships as a contribution to the strengthening of local research capacity...|$|R

NPS has turned to various forms of distance learning to provide education to officers unable to attend its resident programs. A particular challenge NPS faces in developing distance learning programs is determining their cost. While {{there have been numerous}} studies attempting to provide some insight into the costs of delivering distance education programs (i. e., Technology, Open Learning and Distance Education by Dr. Tony Bates of the Open Learning Agency in British Columbia, etc.), there are still many unanswered questions. This thesis analyzed available educational literature on costing distance education programs to assist NPS policy makers in making better decisions. This thesis identified numerous variables that should be considered when developing a cost model for delivering distance education programs that use a combination of web-based instruction, video teleconferencing and traveling instructors. At a minimum, these variables should include: faculty, <b>administrative,</b> technical support, <b>equipment,</b> course development/delivery, consumable, infrastructure and maintenance costs. Of course, terminology and definitions will vary among researchers. We quickly learned from our research that costing distance education programs is an extremely difficult task, specifically when considering web-based instruction.

40|$|Introduction: With {{uncertainty}} {{surrounding the}} true {{impact of the}} ageing population, financing the future of high quality long-term care (LTC) depends on two pivotal factors: cost control and more efficient use of resources. However, the relationships between inputs (and their costs), quality of care and operational efficiency - and what factors determine efficiency - are relatively understudied in the LTC sector. Data Source: This study used data from The Residential Care Facilities Survey (RCFS), for the province of Ontario, collected between 1996 and 2006. The RCFS is a longitudinal census survey administered annually by Statistics Canada, to all LTC facilities operating in Canada that receive public funding. The RCFS contains information about the: 1) facility’s type, location, chain ownership and profit status; 2) quantity and cost of inputs employed (i. e. nursing staff, other medical staff, <b>administrative</b> staff, <b>equipment,</b> number of beds, etc.); 3) age, sex and morbidity distribution of residents; 4) number of patient days; and 5) number of deaths and discharges. Methods: Using the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) of panel data, this study assesses the determinants of operational efficiency in LTC facilities in Ontario, while controlling for quality of care. In keeping with the literature, output was measured in total resident days; capital inputs were estimated based on prescription drug and medical supplies expenditure, as well as total number of beds; and labour inputs were measured in cumulated paid hours of direct care and other staff (including RNs, physiotherapists/occupational therapists, other direct care staff, administration, dietary services staff, other general services staff, recreational staff, and etc.) in each LTC facility. Conclusions: Our analysis revealed significant differences in performance by facility size, {{despite the fact that}} facilities are compensated at the same per diem rates, with larger LTC facilities operating more efficiently than smaller LTC facilities. We also found significant differences in performance by profit status and urban/rural location. The results also underline the importance of considering an array of quality indicators and controlling for endogeneity of quality.

40|$|There {{are many}} formal {{techniques}} for the systematic analysis of {{occupational safety and}} health in general as well as specific areas. Currently there is increased interest in the evaluation of environmental safety and health. In the light of this a project was initiated for the evaluation of environmental safety and health at the Sultan Yusuf Hydro Electric Power generation Plant (JOR Power Station) at Cameron Highlands in Pahang. It was with a view to creating a conceptual framework for hazard identification and risk assessment at the power generating station of the plant and to recommend control measures with respect to environmental safety and health for the people, particularly the employees and workers, the process and the environment. In this study hazard identification was used to identify the primary and secondary or specific hazards which may be inherent in the system and determined as serious threat for plant operation and maintenance. The following methods were used to identify hazards at the JOR hydroelectric Power Station: checklists, work place inspection which included observation and interview, task safety analysis or job hazard analysis as well as accident and incident investigation. For risk assessment, the Likert scale was complemented by the Severity matrix analysis {{in order to determine the}} probability and extent of the situation at the Power generation plant. Together with the hazards identified, risk assessment was used to identify control measures in order to mitigate, as well as, eliminate hazards in the system by applying some controlling method such as, personal protective <b>equipment,</b> <b>administrative</b> and engineering control which would subsequently be monitored in order to establish a safety system for the plant. Meanwhile, wastes-related risks are also identified and mitigated in purpose study plant. iii A total of forty-one important hazard items were identified at the JOR power station system. These hazards were mainly identified by means of checklists which were sourced from literature and subsequently customized for the current purpose. Risk assessment was conducted by initially classifying the hazards into three levels such as Low, Medium and High. Generally 66...|$|R
40|$|Incubators assist new {{businesses}} {{to grow by}} providing start-up entrepreneurs with physical and/or internet space, access to shared <b>equipment,</b> <b>administrative</b> services and business assistance programs. This qualitative research study explored management and stakeholder practices in business incubators to gain deeper insights about the motivations and objectives of incubator sponsors and the clients-entrepreneurs served by the incubator manager. The thesis is centred on two major research questions: 1. What are {{the challenges of the}} not-for-profit incubator manager, split between the social objectives of the sponsors and the need to run the incubator as a selfsustaining entrepreneurial business oriented organisation? 2. What are the parameters for optimum sponsorship and funding of Australian notfor- profit incubators? These questions, divided into a number of sub-questions, were investigated in ten incubators during two research phases with data collected over a period of {{two and a half years}} from forty six incubator tenants, four Australian incubator managers and six managers of incubators and incubator programs in Portugal, the UK and the Netherlands. The data sets were coded and analysed following grounded theory principles primarily using NVivo® 7 software in which the data was subjected to open, axial and selective coding processes. The findings showed that there was a direct link between the sponsor’s strategic orientation whether for-profit and not-for-profit and the effectiveness and organisational performance of the incubator manager and thus the incubator as a whole. The findings further indicated that despite inadequate finance, lack of profit making tools, autonomy and training to optimise success, not-for-profit incubator managers almost single-handedly contributed to the successful performance of the incubators because of their high levels of social capital and entrepreneurial orientation styles. Based on these findings, a new conceptual model was developed in order to determine the parameters for the funding of not-for-profit incubators that would facilitate both its financial success and its socio-economic mission. Following the dialectic system of requisite holism and critical realism perspectives (Neergaard, 1999; Rebernik and Mulej, 2000) which views incubators as part of a complex social system, a new conceptual model was developed depicting relationshipbased traits and activities recognised as socio-economic tools that have an impact on business performance and success in Australian and international incubators...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{acquisition}} and elimination {{of products and}} the resources needed to create them constitutes {{an important part of}} the business decision-making process. Activity-based costing (ABC) supports this process by providing a tool for evaluating the relative profitability of various products. It accomplishes this by allocating costs to products based on the activities, and in turn the resources demanded by those activities, required to produce them. In allocating indirect costs traditionally considered "fixed," such as <b>equipment,</b> <b>administrative</b> overhead, and support staff salaries, ABC treats all costs as variable in the long-run. However, many costs can only vary in discrete steps. For example, one usually cannot purchase a fractional piece of equipment; one chooses either to buy it or not to buy it. Also, in adding support staff, one will typically find that people demand full-time positions, so increments will come in discrete amounts. This stairstep semivariable nature of many costs runs counter to ABC's treatment of all costs as variable. In addition, different products often draw upon the same resources. This creates complex interactions, making it difficult to predict the ultimate consequences of adding or eliminating a particular product. Mixed integer programming (MIP) provides another tool for making these product/resource mix decisions. Unlike ABC, however, it can handle variables that take on integer values, and hence deal appropriately with stairstep semivariable costs. It also ensures that the decision recommended by the model will optimize profitability, given that a solution exists and the underlying assumptions hold true. In doing this, MIP automatically adjusts for all of the complex interactions that exist among the various products and resources. Using a simplified two product/two resource model, one can detail the mathematics behind ABC and MIP, and then link the two approaches through a common variable. This allows one to establish the conditions under which ABC and MIP will yield the same results, and those under which they will differ. Since MW produces an optimal solution, the fact that ABC yields a different result under specific circumstances underscores the danger of relying solely on the product margins generated by an ABC model...|$|R
