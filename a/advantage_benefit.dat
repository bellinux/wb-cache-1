40|$|De Bono's Six Thinking Hats {{technique}} suggests {{different types}} of thinking corresponding to six thinking roles for the analyst, associated with hats of six different colors. The technique correlates different thinking styles used in a systematic problem solving procedure with different coloured hats. Alternately, by conceptualizing each type of hat, the person focuses on the style of thinking associated with each colour so that the problem can be analysed from different angles and frame of references. This method supports lateral thinking possibilities and new outcomes during problem solving session so that the optimum solution can be found out. In this paper, we have analysed six thinking hat technique using our ABCD analysis framework. ABCD analysing technique refers to examining a system, model, or concept through focussing on its <b>advantages,</b> <b>benefits,</b> constraints, disadvantages by narrowing to determinant factors, key factors, and critical constituent elements. Determinant factors form the overall frame of reference while key factors represent the dimensions on which its <b>advantages,</b> <b>benefits,</b> constraints and disadvantages are reflected.

40|$|Nasal {{high flow}} is a {{promising}} novel oxygen delivery device, whose mechanisms of action offer some beneficial effects over conventional oxygen systems. The administration {{of a high}} flow of heated and humidified gas mixture promotes higher and more stable inspiratory oxygen fraction values, decreases anatomical dead space and generates a positive airway pressure that can reduce the work of breathing and enhance patient comfort and tolerance. Nasal high flow {{has been used as}} a prophylactic tool or as a treatment device mostly in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure, with the majority of studies showing positive results. Recently, its clinical indications have been expanded to post-extubated patients in intensive care or following surgery, for pre- and peri-oxygenation during intubation, during bronchoscopy, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with “do not intubate” status. In the present review, we differentiate studies that suggest an <b>advantage</b> (<b>benefit)</b> from other studies that do not suggest an advantage (no benefit) compared to conventional oxygen devices or noninvasive ventilation, and propose an algorithm in cases of nasal high flow application in patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure of almost any cause...|$|E
40|$|MBA 2008 ABSTRACT Corporations fight many battles {{to match}} and {{eventually}} beat their {{competitors in the}} marketplace. The development and usage of intellectual property provides a springboard for competitive advantage, {{but there are many}} factors that hamper corporations in order to strategise and benefit fully from their proprietary intellectual property. The objective of this research was to identify these factors and to find out what corporations are doing in order to protect their intellectual property for purposes of competitive advantage. The research was conducted through in-depth semi structured interviews with respondents from corporations who deal with such corporations’ intellectual property on a day to day basis and with respondents from firms of attorneys who specialises in the field of intellectual property law. The findings of the research are that notwithstanding the fact that corporations in general understand the benefits of identifying, documenting and protecting their intellectual property, that there are many factors that prevent these benefits from being capitalised on. In order for corporations to fully reap the competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>benefit</b> from their intellectual property, it is recommended that corporations conduct intellectual property audits, employ dedicated intellectual property custodian(s), build a relationship with a firm of attorneys that understand the corporation’s intellectual property portfolio, ensure active leadership support for intellectual property portfolio management and develop the necessary documentation, policies and procedures that focus on the protection of intellectual property...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe huge {{research}} {{efforts to develop}} integrated pest management (IPM) have failed to reduce pesticide use and to foster IPM adoption by farmers. Indeed, despite five decades since the concept of integrated control and threshold theory was developed, and four decades since IPM programs have been implemented in USA, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and India, {{the widespread use of}} complex IPM practices has not been adopted. This failure can be explained by IPM complexity, policy restrictions, and counteracting forces of the pesticide industry. This article is a study of drivers that rule the adoption or rejection of IPM by 150 farmers from the Indian state of Punjab. Cotton was cultivated under an insecticide resistance management-based IPM program. This program was implemented in Punjab from 2002 to 2007. A rating scale was developed to measure farmers’ perceived attitudes. An adoptability index was developed. Results show that farmers exhibited very different adoption attitudes. Specifically, farmers adopted widely practices that have no complexity, higher economic advantage, and observability. IPM practices with adoptability indices higher than 0. 60 have been widely adopted. The predicted adoptability and effective actual adoption of IPM practices were well correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0. 88. Technological attributes complexity and relative economic advantage induced a variation of 99  % in the adoptability. Overall the findings show that relative economic <b>advantage,</b> <b>benefit</b> visibility, compatibility with past experiences, and complexity are the most effective drivers in predicting adoption or rejection. Whereas, unexpectedly, socio-personal and economic factors used by most scientists are relatively insignificant. The new methodological frame can be applied to predict the adoption of agricultural innovations...|$|E

It is {{founded in the}} context of changed employee mindset of the modern day employee which has undergone enormous change due to changes in technology and means of production, production relations, customer and societal perception and one’s own expectations. The quest for creativity propels the employee to contribute to the organization drawing positive energy from his innate potential and tuned to best performance models around him through self-exploration. This is a management strategy which believes in delivering targets as responsibility, feeling of creativity, and contribution for motivation, identifying with the organization as commitment and accountability as a hallmark of efficiency.

Whereas these provide a broad-based assessment of individual institutions and systems, it suffers limitations while applying to business context. The success of any business model depends on how a company makes a profit by specifying its position in the value chain. Therefore identifying suitable business models which would enhance customer value and generate revenue is the current challenge for organizations. In this paper, we have proposed a new technique namely ABCD Technique to analyze a business model and to study its effectiveness in providing value to its stakeholders and sustainable profit through expected revenue generation. ABCD is an acronym that stands for <b>Advantages,</b> <b>Benefits,</b> Constraints, and Disadvantages. Application of ABCD analysis results in an organized list of business <b>advantages,</b> <b>benefits,</b> constraints, and disadvantages in a systematic matrix.
