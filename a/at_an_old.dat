5|$|The {{village of}} Khe Sanh was {{the seat of}} {{government}} of Huong Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations, situated about seven miles from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam.

The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by US Army Special Forces of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> French fort. The camp then became a Special Forces outpost of the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), whose purpose was to keep watch on NVA infiltration along the border {{and to protect the}} local population.|$|E

25|$|Scholars such as Paul Numrich {{have stated}} that despite surface level non-scholarly analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have {{inherent}} and irreconcilable differences at the deepest levels.

Buddhists scholars such as Masao Abe and D. T. Suzuki see the centrality of crucifixion in Christianity as an irreconcilable gap between the lives of Buddha and Jesus. Despite this, some Hindus see Jesus as a shaktavesha avatar, or an empowered incarnation.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Sagordari, a village in Keshabpur Upazila, Jessore District of Undivided Bengal (now Bangladesh).

His {{childhood}} education started in a village named Shekpura, <b>at</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> mosque, where he went to learn Persian. He was an exceptionally talented student. Since his childhood, Dutt was recognised by his teachers and professors as being a precocious child with a gift of literary expression. He was very imaginative. Early exposure to English education and European literature at home and in Kolkata inspired him to emulate the English in taste, manners and intellect. An early influence was his teacher at Hindu College, Calcutta, David Lester Richardson. Richardson was a poet and inspired in Dutt a love of English poetry, particularly Byron.|$|E
