40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} potential of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and MAV (Micro Air Vehicle) technology and their wide ranging applications including defence missions, reconnaissance and surveillance, border patrol, disaster zone assessment and atmospheric research. High investment levels from the military sector globally is driving {{research and development and}} increasing the viability of autonomous platforms as replacements for the remotely piloted vehicles more commonly in use. UAV/UAS pose a number of new challenges, with the autonomy and in particular collision avoidance, detect <b>and</b> <b>avoid,</b> or sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid,</b> as the most challenging one, involving both regulatory and technical issues. Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> in UAS: Research and Applications covers the problem of detect, sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> in UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) in depth and combines the theoretical and application results by leading academics and researchers from industry and academia. Key features: •Presents a holistic view of the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> problem in the wider application of autonomous systems •Includes information on human factors, regulatory issues and navigation, control, aerodynamics and physics aspects of the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> problem in UAS •Provides professional, scientific and reliable content that is easy to understand, and •Includes contributions from leading engineers and researchers in the field Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> in UAS: Research and Applications is an invaluable source of original and specialised information. It acts as a reference manual for practising engineers and advanced theoretical researchers and also forms a useful resource for younger engineers and postgraduate students. With its credible sources and thorough review process, Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> in UAS: Research and Applications provides a reliable source of information in an area that is fast expanding but scarcely covered...|$|R
40|$|Since {{unmanned}} aircraft {{do not have}} a pilot on-board the aircraft, they cannot literally comply with the "see and avoid" requirement beyond a short distance from the location of the unmanned pilot. No performance standards are presently defined for unmanned Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> systems, <b>and</b> the FAA has no published approval criteria for a collision avoidance system. Before the FAA can develop the necessary guidance (rules / regulations / policy) regarding the see-and-avoid requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), a concise understanding of the term "equivalent level of safety" must be attained. Since this term is open to interpretation, the UAS industry and FAA need to come to an agreement on how this term can be defined and applied for a safe and acceptable collision avoidance capability for {{unmanned aircraft}}. Defining an equivalent level of safety (ELOS) for sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> {{is one of the first}} steps in understanding the requirement and developing a collision avoidance capability. This document provides a functional level definition of see-and-avoid as it applies to unmanned aircraft. The sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS definition is intended as a bridge between the see <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> requirement <b>and</b> the system level requirements for unmanned aircraft sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> systems. Sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS is defined in a rather abstract way, meaning that it is not technology or system specific, and the definition provides key parameters (and a context for those parameters) to focus the development of cooperative and non-cooperative sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system requirements...|$|R

Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.|$|E

40|$|The sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> {{capability}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges that has to be addressed to safely integrate unmanned aircraft systems into civil and nonsegregated airspace. This paper gives a review of existing regulations, recommended practices, and standards in sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> for unmanned aircraft systems. Gaps and issues are identified, as are the different factors that are likely to affect actual sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> requirements. It is found that the operational environment (flight altitude, meteorological conditions, and class of airspace) plays an important role when determining the type of flying hazards that the unmanned aircraft system might encounter. In addition, the automation level and the data-link architecture of the unmanned aircraft system are key factors that will definitely determine the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system requirements. Tactical unmanned aircraft, performing similar missions to general aviation, are found to be the most challenging systems from an sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> point of view, and further research and development efforts are still needed before their seamless integration into nonsegregated airspac...|$|R

5|$|An-Nasir Ahmad {{was known}} to be a seclusive sultan, {{surrounding}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, rarely making direct contact with the Mamluk emirs of Egypt <b>and</b> <b>avoiding</b> the public view. Two months into his reign, he relocated to al-Karak with substantial sums from the treasury and several horses and senior administrative officials. He ruled from the desert fortress, leaving a deputy, Emir Aqsunqur al-Salari, to oversee affairs in Egypt on his behalf. His unorthodox rule, alleged frivolity, and his execution of loyal partisans, namely Tashtamur and Qutlubugha, led to an-Nasir Ahmad being deposed from the sultanate by his half-brother, as-Salih Isma'il. He remained in the fortress of al-Karak, which the Mamluks besieged at least seven times, until being captured in July 1344. He was killed later that month on the orders of as-Salih Isma'il.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link will encounter a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, <b>and</b> <b>avoiding</b> hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of 1967 the Viet Cong seemed to have melted away in Phuoc Tuy province, abandoning many of their bunker systems <b>and</b> <b>avoiding</b> the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had {{weakened}} the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted the commander of the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—Brigadier Stuart Graham—to speculate that the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. Graham reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy.|$|E
