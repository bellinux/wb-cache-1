40|$|We use an {{important}} legal event {{as a natural}} experiment to {{examine the effect of}} management fiduciary duties on equity-debt conflicts. A 1991 Delaware bankruptcy ruling changed the nature of corporate directors' fiduciary duties in firms incorporated in that state. This change limited managers' incentives to take actions favoring equity over debt for firms in the vicinity of financial distress. We show that this ruling increased the likelihood of equity issues, increased investment, and reduced firm risk, consistent with a decrease in debt-equity conflicts of interest. The changes are isolated to firms relatively closer to default. The ruling was also followed by an increase in average leverage and a reduction in covenant use. Finally, we estimate the welfare implications of this change and find that firm values increased when the rules were introduced. We conclude that managerial fiduciary duties <b>affect</b> equity-bond <b>holder</b> conflicts {{in a way that is}} economically important, has impact on ex ante capital structure choices, and affects welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|Mortgages {{constitute}} the largest part of household debt. An essential choice when {{taking out a}} mortgage is between fixed-interest-rate mortgages (FRMs) and adjustable-interest-rate mortgages (ARMs). However, so far, no comprehensive cross-country study has analysed what determines household demand for mortgage types, a task that this paper takes up using new data for the euro area. Our results support the hypothesis of Campbell and Cocco (2003) that the decision is best described as one of household risk management: income volatility reduces the take-out of ARMs, while increasing duration and relative size of the mortgages increase it. Controlling for other supply factors through country fixed effects, loan pricing also matters, as expected, with ARMs becoming more attractive when yield spreads rise. The paper also conducts a simulation exercise to identify how the easing of monetary policy during the financial crisis <b>affected</b> mortgage <b>holders.</b> It shows that the resulting reduction in mortgage rates produced a substantial decline in debt burdens among mortgage-holding households, especially in countries where households have higher debt burdens and {{a larger share of}} ARMs, as well as for some disadvantaged groups of households, such as those with low income...|$|R

Citing his nearly decade long tenure as a notary, his claims were well-founded that haciendas were vastly under-assessed for tax purposes and that small holders were disadvantaged against the wealth and political connections of large estate owners. Since title transfers of property required payment of fees and that the fee was high enough to negatively <b>affect</b> small <b>holders</b> but not large. In addition, the local tax on title transfers {{was based on a}} property’s assessment, so in a similar fashion, small holders paid a higher percentage than large holders who had ample means to pay such taxes. [...] Large estates often occupied more land than they actually held title to, counting on their size and clout to survive challenges by those on whom they infringed. [...] A great number of individual small holders had only imperfect title to their land, some no title at all, so that Díaz’s requirement that land be properly titled or be subject to appropriation under the [...] "vacant lands" [...] law (terrenos baldíos) meant that they were at risk for losing their land.

[...] Noah Feldman noted that one effect of the State Department revocation could have been that [...] "that the Boston court order was in effect nullified even before it was issued" [...] (since [...] "it was lawful to enter the U.S. in Boston if you had a valid visa, but you couldn't have a valid visa because the memo revoked the visas"), but a federal judge in Los Angeles issued an order prohibiting cancellation of valid visas, appearing to negate the State Department order.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a firm that}} operates a single plant and has an expansion option {{to invest in a}} new plant with convertible debt financing. This conversion feature introduces another complication {{not only because of the}} added conversion timing problem (by the bond holder) but also because the equity holder needs to take future conversion into account when evaluating her expansion/financing decision. We have two main objectives here. We use game options techniques to analyze optimal strategies involved in this convertible debt financed expansion problem. The first goal is to provide a comprehensive framework and procedure for solving the problem in a mathematically tractable way. Secondly, we illustrate our solution method through a concrete example with economic analysis. This includes a comparison with straight bond financing and comparative statics with respect to price volatility and conversion ratio. In this regard, we attempt to clarify how the conversion feature <b>affects</b> the equity <b>holder’s</b> investment decisions.

5000|$|Credit {{enhancement}} is key {{in creating}} a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds. The subordinate bonds are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement. As a result, {{it is possible for}} defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without <b>affecting</b> payments to <b>holders</b> of the senior bonds. Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a [...] "cushion" [...] against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.|$|R

This paper investigates t he changing approaches towards sustainable development undertaken by t he Mining Association of Canada (M AC) over a period of approximately 20 years. The analysis begins in the early 1990 s when MAC initiated the Whitehorse Mining Initiative (WMI) and concludes in 2010 when the association was operating under a strategy entitled Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the economics of damage to crops and infrastructure, injuries and loss of life at the human-elephant interface within Tsavo Conservation Area between 2010 and 2013. Data was generated from the Kenya Wildlife Service occurrence data base. A total of 488 cases with complete data were extracted. Both descriptive and inferential statistics was used in data analysis. The study established that zones with a higher incidence of conflict were proximate to the park and near main water points. Crop damage was the most (83 %) prominent reason for human-elephant conflict. Others were property destruction (8 %), human injuries (5 %) and human deaths (4 %). Crop damage occurred more often during wet seasons than dry seasons. Correlation analyses showed that the size of land was significantly associated with the value of the crop destroyed, with mean land size being 0. 7 (+/- 0. 99) acres. This was equivalent to 984, 254 kg of crop yields over four years with an average of 246 063. 71 (+/- 21 288) kg/annum. The main crop destroyed was maize, planted as a single crop. The majority (76 %) of those <b>affected</b> were small <b>holders</b> with less than 0. 7 acres and they practiced subsistence farming. Men were the only gender killed by elephants (n= 21), although both sexes were injured (n= 24). In total, 40 incidents recorded damage to buildings and infrastructure. The value of crop damage, human injuries and deaths was Kenyan shillings 32, 618, 500 over the four year study period. It is recommended that the government should reduce human/elephant interaction in Tsavo Conservation Area by erecting an electric fence around the park, involving the community and compensating them for the entire cost of the loss incurred due to elephants from the Park.

40|$|While {{imperial}} China was a notably inventive place, formal {{intellectual property}} protections analogous {{to those in}} the West failed to emerge there of their own accord. The deep influence of Confucianism on imperial Chinese society brought about a culture that subordinated individual desires to group harmony and perceived original creations as products not of individual people but of the society to which they belonged. Moreover, Confucianism 2 ̆ 7 s influence on education and literature rendered verbatim copying not merely an accepted practice but a fundamental aspect of scholarship. Buddhism 2 ̆ 7 s close connection to the emergence of printing in China also served to delay by centuries the first claims by authors of ownership interests in their works. Accordingly, the impetus for China 2 ̆ 7 s modern intellectual property regime came from abroad. After China 2 ̆ 7 s defeat in the Opium War, foreign investment in China increased dramatically and Western commercial interests began to press China for the legal recognition of their intellectual property rights. An effective enforcement regime, however, eluded China until the birth of the PRC. Since the late 1970 s, the PRC has taken efforts to integrate China 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property regime with international institutions. China acceded to TRIPS in 1999 and joined the WTO in 2001. In tandem with these legal developments, China 2 ̆ 7 s economy has rapidly become the world 2 ̆ 7 s second largest, a fact attributable largely to foreign direct investment. China 2 ̆ 7 s economic rise especially <b>affects</b> foreign <b>holders</b> of intellectual property rights. Commentators, however, differ starkly in their assessments of the ability of China 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property institutions to combat infringement. On the one hand, China 2 ̆ 7 s apologists claim that such institutions are [...] or imminently will be [...] sufficient to provide for the just and efficient resolution of disputes arising out of infringement. On the other hand, China 2 ̆ 7 s critics, particularly those in the United States, contend that China 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property regime fails to deter and remedy infringement. Ultimately, the views of China 2 ̆ 7 s apologists are misleading. China 2 ̆ 7 s specialized intellectual property tribunals have proven to be relatively effective, but insufficient resources, judicial corruption, and the inability of judges to act independent of the Chinese Communist Party hinder the effectiveness of China 2 ̆ 7 s judiciary. China 2 ̆ 7 s fragmented administrative enforcement bureaucracy, which handles the overwhelming majority of disputes arising out of infringement, suffers from a host of problems that work to the detriment of right holders. Criminal enforcement almost always results in convictions, yet procedural inefficiencies render such convictions frustratingly difficult to achieve. These shortcomings may be attributed to certain historical phenomena. Specifically, the Chinese state, in administering China 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property regime, has adopted an approach that comports with Confucianism 2 ̆ 7 s elevation of state prerogatives at the expense of individual interests. Trends in patent law reform, trade secret litigation, and trademark enforcement bolster this conception of the Chinese state 2 ̆ 7 s motivations. Foreign right holders, therefore, cannot reasonably expect China 2 ̆ 7 s intellectual property regime to serve their interest in combating infringement. Consequently, foreign victims of infringement should seek to reverse the trend of anemic foreign litigation in China and employ China 2 ̆ 7 s courts, especially the intellectual property tribunals, to vindicate their rights. Indeed, the Chinese government appears disinclined to take foreign perspectives under consideration in drafting new intellectual property legislation, a trend that may render the courts the only venue where foreign right holders can air their grievances. Finally, foreign right holders might also attempt to initiate private criminal prosecutions against infringers, although this avenue of enforcement is less likely to deliver favorable results...|$|R
