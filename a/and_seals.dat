5|$|Individual states {{approached}} {{their coats}} of arms <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> {{in a similar}} manner (i.e., seeking direction from the statesmen and scholars of their community). A few of those involved in the design of state arms <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> include (but is not limited to): John Jay and Gouverneur Morris (New York); Francis Hopkinson (New Jersey); David Rittenhouse and George Clymer (Pennsylvania); and George Mason, Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin West, and Thomas Jefferson (Virginia).|$|E
5|$|Coins <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> {{from the}} site were studied. A {{particular}} circular seal cast in bronze with two headed eagle at the top {{has been identified as}} belonging to tsar John Alexander (r. 1331–1371). The image on the seal is stated to be a common feature of the 14th century seals, which were also made of gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E

5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Few {{documents}} {{written in}} either the Khitan large or small script survive to this day. Most surviving specimens of both Khitan scripts are epitaph inscriptions on stone tablets, {{as well as a}} number of inscriptions on coins, mirrors <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> Only a single manuscript text in the Khitan large script is known (Nova N 176), and no manuscripts in the Khitan small script are known. The Liao emperors could read Chinese, and while there were some Chinese works translated into Khitan during the Liao dynasty, the Confucian classics, which served as the core guide to the administration of government in China, are not known to have been translated into Khitan.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is bolstered {{by the fact that}} some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|E

5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Military Cooperation, {{just one}} and a half blocks from the embassy, {{required}} evacuation. Despite its proximity to the embassy, an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest. A convoy of vehicles with several Marines <b>and</b> <b>SEALs</b> left the embassy at 8:47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the OMC (four Americans, a Filipino, and 17 Kenyans). This was the only excursion outside the embassy by the security detail. Throughout the day, foreign diplomats contacted the embassy desiring to be evacuated; the US welcomed these requests, but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy.|$|E
5|$|The coast now {{shows the}} open and ancient {{landscape}} of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (<b>and</b> <b>seals</b> can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard's Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces bright yellow petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> can be spotted in the water.|$|E
5|$|These expeditions {{departed}} Egypt {{from the}} port of Ain Sukhna, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, as revealed by papyri <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> bearing Djedkare Isesi's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise {{in the year of}} the seventh cattle count–possibly Djedkare's 14th year on the throne.|$|E

5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the door, and then turns off the lights <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies.

5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers of the Articles of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales <b>and</b> <b>seals.</b> Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their ability to find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{religion}} recognizes {{literally thousands}} of deities, and distinct iconographies have been identified for about a dozen. Less frequently, gods are identified by a written label or dedication; such labels would only have been intended for the literate elites. In creating a religious object, the sculptor was not free to create novel images: the representation of deities, their attributes and context were as much part of the religion as the rituals and the mythology. Indeed, innovation and deviation from an accepted canon {{could be considered a}} cultic offense. The large degree of similarity that is found in plaques <b>and</b> <b>seals</b> suggests that detailed iconographies could have been based on famous cult statues; they established the visual tradition for such derivative works but have now been lost. It appears, though, that the Burney Relief was the product of such a tradition, not its source, since its composition is unique.|$|E
