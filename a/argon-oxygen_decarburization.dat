40|$|Abstract: The <b>Argon-Oxygen</b> <b>Decarburization</b> (AOD) is the {{refining}} process {{of stainless steel}} to get its final chemical composition through several stages, where tons of materials are added and oxygen and inert gas are blown. The decarburization efficiency and the final temperature in each stage are two important values of this process. We present in this paper an empirical model, based on Multilayer Perceptron, to predict these values in order to automate and enhance the production performance of the AOD. Two architectures are proposed and compared...|$|E
40|$|Due to exhibiting an {{excellent}} chemical resistance against basic environments at high temperature, good thermal shock resistance, thermodynamic {{stability in the}} presence of carbon, and a suitable abrasion resistance, MgO-CaO refractories are widely used in <b>argon-oxygen</b> <b>decarburization</b> furnaces in the metallurgy industry and cement rotary kilns. Furthermore, MgO-CaO refractories are beneficial to removing inclusions from molten steels; thus, they have been considered {{to be one of the}} effective refractory types for processing clean steel products. Also, MgO-CaO materials have become one of the attractive steelmaking refractories because of their low cost and high ore reserves.   However, in spite of these primary advantages, the application of MgO-CaO refractories has not been popular due to its tendency to hydration when exposed to the atmosphere.   In world most of MgO-CaO bricks producers used of organic components such as tar, pitch, and peck for produce MgO-CaO refractories. But during the application of these bricks in steel and cement and industrials, they released CO and CO 2 gases to air and pollute the atmosphere. For this reason, recently some researcher investigate the effect of additive nanoparticles on MgO-CaO refractories performance. They reported the used of Nano-additive have acceptable results and additive nanoparticles can replace by aforementioned environment contaminating organic compounds. In this study, we reviewed all effort that done for improving the hydration resistance of MgO-CaO refractories by application of Nano-additives with an emphasis on the beneficial the use of additives nanoparticle for reduction of environmental pollution by various industries which used of MgO-CaO refractory bricks...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} and optimisation of the metallurgical processes require access to accurate {{data of the}} physical properties of slags. Viscosity {{is one of the}} most important properties in the case of metallurgical melts, in view of its direct effect on the kinetic conditions of the processes, and is one of the key factors to be taken into consideration in process modeling. The difficulty and high cost of measuring the viscosity of slags has led to development of number of viscosity models. Most of these models employ parameters extracted from experimental data of viscosity, which ensure the validity of the models in viscosity estimation. In this report models developed to estimate the viscosity of fully molten oxide slags were discussed. In addition viscosities of converter slags (Basic Oxygen Furnace, <b>Argon-Oxygen</b> <b>Decarburization</b> furnace) predicted with different models were compered. In the case of BOF-slag the Iida and the modified Urbain models seemed to be more reliable than the other models in predicting the viscosities. The values calculated by KTH model were too high for this high basic slag whereas in the case of NPL model the slag composition was observed to be outside of the working range of the model. Urbain model modified by Forsbacka as well as the modified Iida models takes account of chromium oxide as a separate component in the calculations and are thus assumed to be more reliable than the other models in predicting viscosities of chromium containing slags. However the reliability of these models is debatable in the case of high chromium containing slags e. g. AOD-slag after oxidising period due to existing of solid phases in the slag. Iida as well as the Urbain model modified by Forsbacka are also assumed to be reliable predicting viscosity of slag composition corresponding the AOD-slag after reduction period. Also NPL-model seemed to give reliable viscosity values, since in this case the slag composition is inside the working range of the model. Although there are plenty of experimentally measured viscosity data available for ternary systems, less data in limited ranges are available as the order of the system gets higher. Also lack of experimental data of very basic slag compositions as well as slags containing iron and chromium oxides is apparent. Due to lack of experimental data the performance of these models in predicting viscosities of converter slags was not able to evaluate. Thus more experimental work is necessary to provide the data to test and optimise the models for these very complex slag compositions...|$|E
