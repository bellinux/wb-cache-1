40|$|We give {{necessary}} and sufficient conditions for weak and strong embeddability of amalgams in each subvariety {{of the category}} of all nilpotent groups of class at most two; this generalizes B. Maier's result for the latter class. We also discuss dominions (in the sense of Isbell), and characterize the weak, strong, and special amalgamation bases for each subvariety, contrasting the resulting classes with one another.

40|$|Scaled Boolean algebras are a {{category}} of mathematical objects that arose from attempts {{to understand why the}} conventional rules of probability should hold when probabilities are construed, not as frequencies or proportions or the like, but rather as degrees of belief in uncertain propositions. This paper separates the study of these objects from that not-entirely-mathematical problem that motivated them. That motivating problem is explicated in the first section, and the application of scaled Boolean algebras to it is explained in the last section. The intermediate sections deal only with the mathematics. It is hoped that this isolation of the mathematics from the motivating problem makes the mathematics clearer.

40|$|Wigner's {{method of}} induced {{representations}} {{is applied to}} the N= 1 super-Poincare group, and by using a state corresponding to the basic vector of the little group as a Clifford vacuum we show that the spin operator of a supersymmetric point particle obeys Wigner's constraints. As dynamical variables for the particle we use canonical coordinates on the symmetry group manifold. The physical phase space is then constructed using a vielbein formalism. We find that the Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz superparticle appears as a special case of our general construction. Finally, the theory is reformulated as a gauge theory where the gauge freedom corresponds to the choice of spin constraints or, equivalently, the free choice of relativistic center of mass. In a special case the gauge symmetry reduces to the well known kappa-symmetry. Comment: LaTeX, 31 pages, submitted to Annals of Physics (uses <b>ajour</b> documentclass file...|$|E
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{different}} approaches presently available in literature to probe the vacuum structure of quantum fields in classical electromagnetic and gravitational backgrounds. We compare {{the results from the}} Bogolubov transformations and the effective Lagrangian approach with the response of monopole detectors (of the Unruh-DeWitt type) in non-inertial frames in flat spacetime and in inertial frames in different types of classical electromagnetic backgrounds. We also carry out such a comparison in inertial and rotating frames when boundaries are present in flat spacetime. We find that the results from these different approaches do not, in general, agree with each other. We attempt to identify the origin of these differences and then go on to discuss its implications for classical gravitational backgrounds.

40|$|We {{study the}} strong, weak, and special {{amalgamation}} {{bases in the}} varieties of nilpotent groups of class two and exponent n, where n is odd. The main result is a characterization of the special amalgamation bases for these varieties. We also characterize the weak and strong bases. For special amalgamation bases, we show that there are groups which are special bases in varieties of finite exponent {{but not in the}} variety of all nil- 2 groups, whereas for weak and strong bases we show this is not the case. We also show that in these varieties, as well as the variety of all nil- 2 groups, a group has an absolute closure (in the sense of Isbell) if and only if it is already absolutely closed, i. e. if and only if it is a special amalgamation base.

40|$|ABSTRACT. An archaeological {{sequence}} of Neo-Eskimo occupations, based upon ex-cavations of eight Thule winter houses near Lake Harbour, Baffin Island, is outlined, beginning around A. D. 1100 and extending {{into the present}} century. Relationships be-tween past climatic events, local environmental characteristics, {{and the organization of}} Neo-Eskimo subsistence-settlement systems are traced throughout this period of time, based on analysis of artifactual, faunal, and midden deposit data. A rescheduling of procurement systems, coupled with a shift in the emphasis of falVwinter settlement options, is seen in response. to climatic/ecological changes, commencing after A. D. 1250, which affected the accessibility of bowhead whales, ringed seal, and caribou. It is sug-gested that flexibility in the organization of domestic units and demographic arrangements was an important cultural mechanism permitting Thule and recent Inuit populations to respond effectively to changes in their biophysical environments.

40|$|We {{give new}} {{positive}} and negative results (some conditional) on speeding up computational algebraic geometry over the reals: (1) A new and sharper upper bound {{on the number of}} connected components of a semialgebraic set. Our bound is novel in that it is stated in terms of the volumes of certain polytopes and, for a large class of inputs, beats the best previous bounds by a factor exponential in the number of variables. (2) A new algorithm for approximating the real roots of certain sparse polynomial systems. Two features of our algorithm are (a) arithmetic complexity polylogarithmic in the degree of the underlying complex variety (as opposed to the super-linear dependence in earlier algorithms) and (b) a simple and efficient generalization to certain univariate exponential sums. (3) Detecting whether a real algebraic surface (given as the common zero set of some input straight-line programs) is not smooth can be done in polynomial time within the classical Turing model (resp. BSS model over C) only if P=NP (resp. NP<=BPP). The last result follows easily from an unpublished result of Steve Smale. Comment: This is the final journal version which will appear in Journal of Complexity. More typos are corrected, and a new section is added where the bounds here are compared to an earlier result of Benedetti, Loeser, and Risler.

40|$|Lace is a {{decorative}} <b>ajour</b> textile. Real laces {{can be divided}} into needle laces and bobbin laces. There are two types of bobbin laces: straight and part-lace. These both techniques were developed in the epoch of renaissance, {{in the first half of}} the 16 th century. The needle lace was developed from a cutwork. The immediate precursors of the needle lace were "point coupe" and "reticella" techniques. The bobbin lace was developed from a passementerie. The bobbin laces as well as the needle laces appeared probably at once in Italy and Flanders. The first laces have a geometric decor. Linear or plant decors were used in the first half of the 17 th century. Fine and light laces with a flower motif rise in the 18 th century. In the end of the 18 th century, the motifs are very small and the most of the laces fill mesh ground. In the epoch of the renaissance and the baroque, good conditions for complex figurative scenes were allowed. A grateful space for (riche -great) religion scenes was given. The lay scenes, almost genre, symbolic and hunting scenes can be seen on the lace, too. All the 16 th century and in the first half of the 17 th century appeared a lot of Pattern Books first for needle laces and then for bobbin laces in Germany and Italy.

40|$|Syftet med den här studien är att undersöka vilka yrkes- och studiebakgrunder yrkesverksamma datalärare har och om olika bakgrund leder till skillnad i uppfattningar om deras yrke och utbildning. Dessutom syftar arbetet till att undersöka hur datalärare håller sina ämneskunskaper <b>ajour</b> och om det finns skillnader i fortbildning beroende på utbildning och yrkesbakgrund. För att besvara arbetets frågeställningar används en kartläggande kvantitativ enkätundersökning som besvaras av yrkesverksamma datalärare från hela landet. För att få fram resultaten görs vissa sambandsanalyser och dessutom presenteras deskriptiv statistik. Undersökningen visar att majoriteten av datalärarna saknar lärarbehörighet samt att ungefär hälften tidigare har arbetat utanför skola och har professionella tillämpningar inom sitt ämne. Det visar sig även att det finns vissa skillnader i datalärarnas uppfattningar i vissa frågor beroende på yrkesbakgrund och utbildning.  The {{main purpose}} of this rapport is to {{investigate}} which different backgrounds concerning working experience and education working computer science teachers have and if different backgrounds lead to a difference in opinion concerning their profession and education. Furthermore the rapport aims to examine how computer science teachers keep {{their knowledge of the}} subject up to date and if there are differences depending on education and earlier working experiences. A quantitative survey using a questionnaire answered by working computer science teachers from across Sweden is used to answer the questions which this rapport is based upon. The results are presented as descriptive statistics and some relations analysis has also been made. The research shows that the majority of computer science teachers lack teacher certification and approximately half of them have previously worked outside school with something within the area in which they are teaching. In addition some differences in opinion among computer science teachers depending on working experience and education are found concerning certain issues...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} on dealing with resistant clients is presented. Based on this review, the authors developed a survey designed to elicit counsellors ' reactions to and experiences with resistant clients. Responses received from 215 members of the American Mental Health Counselors Association suggest that nearly all counsellors have encountered resistant clients, but the counsellors ' reactions to and methods of dealing with these clients differ considerably Resume Cet article présente une revue de littérature se rapportant aux clients résistants. Basé sur cette revue, les auteurs ont développé un questionnaire dans le but de mettre <b>àjour</b> les réactions des conseillers face aux clients résistants et leurs expériences avec ceux-ci. Les réponses reçues de 215 membres de l'American Mental Health Counselors Association suggèrent que pratique-ment tous les conseillers ont rencontré des clients résistants, toutefois les réactions des conseil-lers face ces clients et leurs approches diffèrent considérablement. "I've tried everything I can think of with this client and nothing seems to work. What do you suggest? " This is a question the authors have heard so many times, not only from students, but from seasoned professionals. The experience of coping with difficult clients seems to be one all counsellors share. It can be painful and frustrating or it can be challeng-ing and intriguing. According to Miller and Rollnick (1991), "Resistance is often the life of the play [...] The true art of therapy is tested in the recognition and handling of resistance. It is on this stage that the drama of change unfolds " (p. 112). However, not all therapists view resistance so positively. They may react by feeling threatened, frustrated, annoyed, resentful, exasperated, or angry. Fremont and Anderson (1986) found anger to be a particularly common response to resistance, although its likelihood was negatively correlated with amount of therapist experience. The {{purpose of this article is}} to present an overview of ways to understand and deal with difficult clients, according to both the literature and a survey of member...|$|E
