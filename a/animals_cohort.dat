40|$|Background. The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of abdominal wall reconstruction surgery on tissue anatomy and to explore how flap surgery influences the patientâ€™s immune status. Methods. Experimental abdominal wall defects were created in 8 Sus scrofa (swine) animal models. The animals were divided into two groups: 4 swine were euthanized one month after surgery for the biopsies retrieval purpose and the other 4 swine were kept alive and the collection of blood samples has been done 6 months after surgery. In order to evaluate the relative gene expression in operated-on <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> we compared them with samples from 4 healthy swine used as controls. Results. The inflammatory process was present in all types of repairs. Collagen I deposition was higher in the flap repairs. The expression level for the genes related to immune response after 6 months from surgery was relatively similar to the control group except minor alteration registered in the case of two swine models. Conclusion. Our findings indicate a less pronounced proinflammatory response to surgical trauma in animal models after flap surgery. The postoperative levels of the inflammatory cytokines did not show significant differences after abdominal wall reconstruction using flap surgery...|$|R

Epigenetic expression patterns are mitotically heritable and are stably maintained in adult cells. However, unlike somatic DNA mutation, {{little is known}} about the occurrence of epigenetic change, or epimutation, during normal adult life. We have monitored the age-associated maintenance of two epigenetic systems [...] X inactivation and genomic imprinting [...] using the genes Atp 7 a and Igf 2, respectively. Quantitative measurements of RNA transcripts from the inactive and active alleles were performed in mice from 2 to 24 months of age. For both genes, older <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> showed reproducible increases in transcripts expressed from the silenced alleles. Loss of X chromosome silencing showed cohort mean increases of up to 2. 2 %, while imprinted-gene activation increased up to 6. 7 %. The results support the hypothesis that epigenetic loss of gene repression occurs in normal tissues and may be a contributing factor in progressive physiological dysfunction seen during mammalian aging. Quantitatively, the loss of epigenetic control may be one to two orders of magnitude greater than previously determined somatic DNA mutation...|$|R

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a host of pathological alterations, including transient breakdown of the BBB, thus opening a window for NP delivery to the injured brain tissue. This study focused on investigating the spatiotemporal accumulation of different sized NPs after TBI. Specifically, <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> sustaining a controlled cortical impact injury received an intravenous injection of PEGylated NP cocktail (20, 40, 100, and 500 [*]nm, each with a unique fluorophore) immediately (0 [*]h), 2 [*]h, 5 [*]h, 12 [*]h, or 23 [*]h after injury. NPs were allowed to circulate for 1 [*]h before perfusion and brain harvest. Confocal microscopy demonstrated peak NP accumulation within the injury penumbra 1 [*]h post-injury. An inverse relationship was found between NP size and their continued accumulation within the penumbra. NP accumulation preferentially occurred in the primary motor and somatosensory areas of the injury penumbra as compared to the parietal association and visual area. Thus, we characterized the accumulation of particles up to 500 [*]nm at different times acutely after injury, indicating the potential of NP-based TBI theranostics in the acute period after injury...|$|R

We previously showed that modulation of autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis by overexpression of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) gene {{was effective in}} improving muscle pathology in PD mice injected intramuscularly with an AAV-TFEB vector. Here we have evaluated the effects of TFEB systemic delivery on muscle pathology and on functional performance, a primary measure of efficacy in a disorder like PD. We treated 1 -month-old PD mice with an AAV 2. 9 -MCK-TFEB vector. An <b>animal</b> <b>cohort</b> was analyzed at 3 months for muscle and heart pathology. A second cohort was followed at different timepoints for functional analysis. In muscles from TFEB-treated mice we observed reduced PAS staining and improved ultrastructure, with reduced number and increased translucency of lysosomes, while total glycogen content remained unchanged. We also observed statistically significant improvements in rotarod performance in treated animals compared to AAV 2. 9 -MCK-eGFP-treated mice at 5 and 8 months. Cardiac echography showed significant reduction in left-ventricular diameters. These results show that TFEB overexpression and modulation of autophagy result in improvements of muscle pathology and of functional performance in the PD murine model, with delayed disease progression...|$|R
40|$|Background: As {{a leading}} cause of adult blindness, {{diabetic}} retinopathy is a prevalent and profound complication of diabetes. We have previously reported duration-dependent changes in retinal vascular permeability, apoptosis, and mRNA expression with diabetes in a rat model system. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify retinal proteomic alterations associated with functional dysregulation of the diabetic retina to better understand diabetic retinopathy pathogenesis and that could be used as surrogate endpoints in preclinical drug testing studies. Methodology/Principal Findings: A multi-modal proteomic approach of antibody (Luminex) -, electrophoresis (DIGE) -, and LC-MS (iTRAQ) -based quantitation methods was used to maximize coverage of the retinal proteome. Transcriptomic profiling through microarray analysis was included to identify additional targets and assess potential regulation of protein expression changes at the mRNA level. The proteomic approaches proved complementary, with limited overlap in proteomic coverage. Alterations in pro-inflammatory, signaling and crystallin family proteins were confirmed by orthogonal methods in multiple independent <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts.</b> In an independent experiment, insulin replacement therapy normalized the expression of some proteins (Dbi, Anxa 5) while other proteins (Cp, Cryba 3, Lgals 3, Stat 3) were only partially normalized and Fgf 2 and Crybb 2 expression remained elevated.

Our objective was to determine its value for the evaluation of immunotherapy efficacy in immunocompetent Balb/c mice injected with the A 20 syngeneic B lymphoma cell line. The high level of in vitro FDG uptake by A 20 cells validated the model for further imaging studies. When injected intravenously, the tumour developed as nodular lesions mostly in liver and spleen, thus mimicking the natural course of an aggressive human lymphoma. FDG-PET provided three-dimensionnal images of tumour extension including non-palpable lesions, in good correlation with ex vivo macroscopic examination. When mice were pre-immunized with an A 20 cell lysate in adjuvant before tumour challenge, their significantly longer survival, compared to control mice, were associated with a lower incidence of lymphoma visualized by PET at different time points. Estimation of tumour growth and metabolism using the calculated tumour volumes and maximum standardized uptake values, respectively, also demonstrated delayed lymphoma development and lower activity in the vaccinated mice. Thus, FDG-PET is a sensitive tool relevant for early detection and follow-up of internal tumours, allowing discrimination between treated and non-treated small <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> without invasive intervention...|$|R
40|$|Down {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} triplication of chromosome 21 and is associated with neurocognitive phenotypes ranging from severe intellectual disability to various patterns of more selective neuropsychological deficits, including memory impairments. In the Ts 65 Dn mouse model of Down syndrome, excessive GABAergic neurotransmission results in local over-inhibition of hippocampal circuits, which dampens hippocampal synaptic plasticity and contributes to cognitive impairments. Treatments with several GABAA receptor antagonists result in increased plasticity and improved memory deficits in Ts 65 Dn mice. These GABAA receptor antagonists are, however, not suitable for clinical applications. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, in contrast, is a widely prescribed antidepressant that can also enhance plasticity in the adult rodent brain by lowering GABAergic inhibition. For these reasons, we wondered if an adult-onset 4 -week oral fluoxetine treatment restores spatial learning and memory impairments in Ts 65 Dn mice. Fluoxetine did not measurably improve behavioral impairments of Ts 65 Dn mice. On the contrary, we observed seizures and mortality in fluoxetine-treated Ts 65 Dn mice, raising {{the possibility of a}} drug Ã— genotype interaction with respect to these adverse treatment outcomes. Future studies should re-address this in larger <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> and determine if fluoxetine treatment is associated with adverse treatment effects in individuals with Down syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the derivation of a mathematical model that adequately describes the intercalving body condition score (BCS) profile in dairy cows and is robust and applicable to different <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts.</b> The data used to generate the function were 75, 352 daily BCS records across 3, 209 lactations in 1, 172 cows from a research herd in New Zealand. Mean daily BCS (scale 1 to 10) across all data were plotted and 4 distinct phases were observed. The functional form used to describe the pattern and quantify its features comprised the sum of the 4 phase functions created from intercepts, rates of change, approximate timing of phase transition points, and the sharpness of these transition points in the BCS profile. The generality and applicability of the described model were tested across substrata of BCS at calving and parity. A second data set consisting of a multiyear study comparing cows fed a total mixed ration (TMR) or grazing fresh pasture was compiled from a different research farm. This data set consisted of 4, 112 BCS records from 211 lactations on 95 cows. The third data set was a collation of data from another multiyear experiment comparing animal performance under different stocking rates. The data set consisted of 12, 414 BCS test-day records on 564 lactations from 287 cows. The presented model is robust and applicable to different <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts,</b> explaining between 29 and 79 % of variation depending on the cohort studied. A notable second period of negative energy balance was evident in all grazing cows during midlactation, irrespective of calving BCS, parity, or stocking rate, but did not appear in cows fed TMR. The amount of BCS lost postcalving and nadir BCS were positively correlated with calving BCS, with fatter cows at calving losing more BCS postcalving but remaining at a greater BCS at nadir. Primiparous cows calved at a greater BCS than multiparous cows, as dictated by management protocols, but they failed to regain BCS postnadir as effectively as their multiparous counterparts. Results may highlight the need for preferential feeding of younger cows during late lactation, at least in grazing systems, to ensure that they achieve the required calving BCS at second calving. Cows receiving TMR lost BCS at a slower rate than cows on pasture but for a longer period; the amount of BCS lost between calving and nadir did not differ between the different feeding treatments. Calving BCS declined with increasing stocking rate, and the rates of both loss and gain were negatively affected by stocking rate. The presented model accurately identified biological attributes of the intercalving BCS profile of different groups of cows...|$|R

Uteroplacental insufficiency in rats is a well-established animal model used to mimic and study the effects of developmental insults relevant to countries of abundant nutrient supply. However, wide-ranging outcomes for the offspring are apparent between the different investigators that use this model and also between cohorts generated in our laboratory. We aimed to explore the reasons for variability in rat models of uteroplacental insufficiency between different investigators and also between our own <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts.</b> We suggest differences in growth and disease development reflect uniqueness in susceptibility and highlight the complexity of interactions between genetic potential and environmental exposures. The impact of adverse exposures in utero has been described as having far-reaching effects that extend well beyond the first, directly exposed generation. However, the resulting phenotypes are not consistent between generations. This suggests that programmed effects are established de novo in each generation and challenges the prediction of disease. Characterization of growth and disease in the numerous rat models has led {{to our understanding of the}} impact of early life experiences on adult health. In order to drive the development of preventative and/or treatment strategies, future studies should focus on identifying the initial cause(s) of uteroplacental insufficiency, including genetic origins and the influence of poor diets...|$|R

A/J and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice of both genders were maintained at 20 Â°C and weaned to standard low-fat diet at 30 days of age. During the first day after weaning, using several separate <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts,</b> (i) GTT was performed using 1 or 3 mg glucose/g body weight (BW), while glucose was administered either orally (OGTT) or intraperitoneally (IPGTT) at 20 Â°C; and (ii) indirect calorimetry (INCA) was performed, either in a combination with oral gavage of 1 or 7. 5 mg glucose/g BW, or during a fasting/re-feeding transition. INCA was conducted either at 20 Â°C or 34 Â°C. Results of both OGTT and IPGTT using 1 mg glucose/g BW at 20 Â°C, and INCA using 7. 5 mg glucose/g BW at 34 Â°C, indicated higher glucose tolerance and higher metabolic flexibility to glucose, respectively, and lower fasting glycemia in A/J mice as compared with C 57 BL/ 6 J mice.

40|$|It is {{currently}} thought that treatment for {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) will involve a combined pharmacological and biological approach; however, testing their efficacy in animal models of SCI is time-consuming and requires large <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts.</b> For this reason we have modified our myelinating cultures as an in vitro model of SCI and studied its potential as a prescreen for combined therapeutics. This culture comprises dissociated rat embryonic spinal cord cells plated onto a monolayer of astrocytes, which form myelinated axons interspaced with nodes of Ranvier. After cutting the culture, an initial cell-free area appears persistently devoid of neurites, accompanied over time by many features of SCI, including demyelination and reduced neurite density adjacent to the lesion, and infiltration of microglia and reactive astrocytes into the lesioned area. We tested a range of concentrations of the Rho inhibitor C 3 transferase (C 3) and ROCK inhibitor Y 27632 that {{have been shown to}} promote SCI repair in vivo. C 3 promoted neurite extension into the lesion and enhanced neurite density in surrounding areas but failed to induce remyelination. In contrast, while Y 27632 did not induce significant neurite outgrowth, myelination adjacent to the lesion was dramatically enhanced. The effects of the inhibitors were concentration-dependent. Combined treatment with C 3 and Y 27632 had additive affects with an enhancement of neurite outgrowth and increased myelination adjacent to the lesion, demonstrating neither conflicting nor synergistic effects when coadministered. Overall, these results demonstrate that this culture serves as a useful tool to study combined strategies that promote CNS repair. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, In...|$|R
40|$|The {{developmental}} {{origin of}} health and disease hypothesis states that adverse fetal and early childhood exposures can predispose to obesity, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) in adult life. Early exposure to environmental chemicals interferes with developmental programming and induces subclinical alterations that may hesitate in pathophysiology and behavioral deficits at a later life stage. The mechanisms by which perinatal insults lead to altered programming and to disease later in life are still undefined. The long latency between exposure and onset of disease, the difficulty of reconstructing early exposures, and the wealth of factors which the individual is exposed to during the life course make extremely difficult to prove the developmental origin of NDDs in clinical and epidemiological studies. An overview of animal studies assessing {{the long-term effects of}} perinatal exposure to different chemicals (heavy metals and pesticides) supports the link between exposure and hallmarks of neurodegeneration at the adult stage. Furthermore, models of maternal immune activation show that brain inflammation in early life may enhance adult vulnerability to environmental toxins, thus supporting the multiple hit hypothesis for NDDs' etiology. The study of prospective <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> may help to unraveling the complex pathophysiology of sporadic NDDs. In vivo models could be a powerful tool to clarify the mechanisms through which different kinds of insults predispose to cell loss in the adult age, to establish a cause-effect relationship between "omic" signatures and disease/dysfunction later in life, and to identify peripheral biomarkers of exposure, effects, and susceptibility, for translation to prospective epidemiological studies...|$|R

40|$|Cannibalistic {{interactions}} generally {{depend on}} the size relationship between cannibals and victims. In many populations, a large enough size variation to allow for cannibalism may not only develop among age-cohorts but also within cohorts. We studied the implications of variation in hatching period length and initial cohort size {{for the emergence of}} cannibalism and bimodal size distributions within <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> using a physiologically structured population model. We found that the development of size bimodality was critically dependent on hatching period length, victim density and the presence of a feedback via shared resources. Cannibals only gained enough energy from cannibalism to accelerate in growth when victim density was high relative to cannibal density at the onset of cannibalism. Furthermore, we found that the opportunity for early hatchers to initially feed on an unexploited resource increases the likelihood both for cannibalism to occur and size bimodality to develop. Once cannibals accelerated in growth relative to victims size bimodality, reduced victim numbers and relaxed resource competition resulted. Thus, in addition to that cannibals profited from cannibalism through energy extraction, their potential victims also benefited as the resource recovered due to cannibal thinning. To ensure recruitment success, it can be critical that a few individuals can accelerate in growth and reach a size large enough to escape size-dependent predation and winter starvation. Hence, within-cohort cannibalism may be a potentially important mechanism to explain recruitment variation especially for cannibalistic species in temperate climates with strong seasonality. However, the scope for size bimodality to develop as a result of cannibalism may be limited by low victim densities and size and food-dependent growth rates...|$|R

Although the viral RNA was detected in free-living and parasitic ticks, the vector for SFTSV remains unsettled. Firstly, an experimental infection study in goats was conducted in a bio-safety level- 2 (BSL- 2) facility to investigate virus transmission between animals. The results showed that infected animals did not shed virus to the outside through respiratory or digestive tract route, and the control animals did not get infected. Then, a natural infection study {{was carried out in}} the SFTSV endemic region. A cohort of naÃ¯ve goats was used as sentinel animals in the study site. A variety of daily samples including goat sera, ticks and mosquitoes were collected for viral RNA and antibody (from serum only) detection, and virus isolation. We detected viral RNA from free-living and parasitic ticks rather than mosquitoes, and from goats after ticks' infestation. We also observed sero-conversion in all members of the <b>animal</b> <b>cohort</b> subsequently. The S segment sequences of the two recovered viral isolates from one infected goat and its parasitic ticks showed a 100 % homology at the nucleic acid level. In our natural infection study, close contact between goats does not appear to transmit SFTSV, however, the naÃ¯ve animals were infected after ticks' infestation and two viral isolates derived from an infected goat and its parasitic ticks shared 100 % of sequence identity. These data demonstrate that the etiologic agent for goat cohort's natural infection comes from environmental factors. Of these, ticks, especially the predominant species Haemaphysalis longicornis, probably act as vector for this pathogen. The findings in this study may help local health authorities formulate and focus preventive measures to contain this infection...|$|R

Pubmed and Embase were searched for original articles concerning the effect of meniscus allograft transplantation on articular cartilage compared with both its positive (meniscectomy) and negative (either sham or non-operated) control in healthy animals. Outcome measures related to assessment of damage to articular cartilage were divided in five principal outcome categories. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated and pooled to obtain an overall SMD and 95 % confidence interval. 17 articles were identified, representing 14 original <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> with an average timing of data collection of 24 weeks [range 4 weeks; 30 months]. Compared to a negative control, meniscus allograft transplantation caused gross macroscopic (1. 45 [0. 95; 1. 95]), histological (3. 43 [2. 25; 4. 61]) damage to articular cartilage, and osteoarthritic changes on radiographs (3. 12 [1. 42; 4. 82]). Moreover, results on histomorphometrics and cartilage biomechanics are supportive of this detrimental effect on cartilage. On the other hand, meniscus allograft transplantation caused significantly less gross macroscopic (- 1. 19 [- 1. 84; - 0. 54]) and histological (- 1. 70 [- 2. 67; - 0. 74]) damage to articular cartilage when compared to meniscectomy.

Long Evans rats are subjected to HLS durations of 7, 14, 28 and 90 days. Subgroups of the 90 -day animals are studied for recovery periods of 7, 14, 28 or 90 days. All HLS subjects have age-matched cage controls. Various <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> are planned for this study: young males, young females and old males. In addition to the live measures (ICP by telemetry, IOP and retinal parameters by optical coherence tomography) which are shared with the Fuller study, the specific outcomes for this study include: -Gene expression analysis of the retina -Histologic analysis - Analysis of the microvasculature of retina flat mounts by NASA's VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) Software.

40|$|Preliminary {{data from}} a prior tissuesharing {{experiment}} has suggested that early growth response protein 1 (Egr 1), a transcription factor involved in various stress responses in the vasculature, is induced in the rat retina after 14 days of hindlimb suspension (HS) and may be evidence that mechanical stress is occurring secondary to the cephalad fluid shift. This mechanical stress could cause changes in oxygenation of the retina, and the subsequent ischemia or inflammationdriven hypoxia may lead to microvascular remodeling. This microvascular remodeling process can be studied using image analysis of retinal vessels and can be then be quantified by the VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software, a computational tool that quantifies remodeling patterns of branching vascular trees and capillary or vasculogenic networks. Our project investigates whether rodent HS is a valid model to {{study the effects of}} simulatedweightlessness on ocular structures and their relationship with intracranial pressure (ICP). One of the hypotheses to be tested is that HSinduced cephalad fluid shift is accompanied by vascular engorgement that produces changes in retinal oxygenation, leading to oxidative stress, hypoxia, microvascular remodeling, and cellular degeneration. We have optimized the procedure to obtain flat mounts of rat retina, staining of the endothelial lining in vasculature and acquisition of high quality images suitable for VESGEN analysis. Briefly, eyes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and retinas were detached and then mounted flat on microscope slides. The microvascular staining was done with endothelial cellspecific isolectin binding, coupled to Alexa 488 fluorophore. Image acquisition at low magnification and high resolution was performed using a new Leica SP 8 confocal microscope in a tile pattern across the X,Y plane and multiple sections along the Zaxis. This new confocal microscope has the added capability of dye separation using the Linear Unmixing method and allows us to remove the autofluorescence originating from the photoreceptor layer.

There is a strong interest in early detection of RP using imaging to improve outcomes of RT for lung cancer. This thesis describes a promising approach based on 129 Xe gas as a contrast agent for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lung airspace due to the large increase in signal possible by spin exchange optical pumping, or hyperpolarization (Hp). Additionally, 129 Xe provides unique functional information due to its relatively high solubility and significant chemical shift in pulmonary tissue (PT) and red blood cell (RBC) compartments. In this thesis, a specialized Hp 129 Xe MRI method was developed for detection of gas exchange abnormalities in the lungs associated with thoracic RT. In particular, the feasibility of quantifying the early phase of RILI is demonstrated in a rat model of RILI two weeks post-irradiation with a single fraction dose of 18 Gy. The challenge of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the dissolved phases was addressed in this work by development and construction of a Transmit-Only/Receive-Only radiofrequency coil. Another challenge addressed in the thesis was the lack of imaging techniques that provide sufficient spatial and temporal information for gas exchange. Therefore, a novel Hp 129 Xe MRI technique was developed based on the multi-point IDEAL pulse sequence. The combination of these two developments enabled investigation of regional gas exchange changes associated with RP in the rat lung two weeks post-irradiation to assess the feasibility of early detection of RILI. Theoretical analysis of the gas exchange curves enabled measurements of average PT thickness (LPT) increases consistent with histology and relative blood volume (VRBC) reductions in the irradiated <b>animal</b> <b>cohort</b> compared to a non-irradiated cohort, and between irradiated right lungs compared to unirradiated left lungs in the irradiated cohort...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic nuclear {{polarization}} creates a transient hyperpolarized nuclear state that can dramatically increase the signal detected by magnetic resonance imaging. This signal increase allows real-time spectroscopic imaging of specific metabolites in vivo by magnetic resonance. Real-time imaging {{of both the}} spatial and chemical fate of hyperpolarized metabolites is showing great promise to meaningfully benefit clinical care of cancer patients. Imaging of hyperpolarized agents will have a larger clinical impact if it can function as a quantitative modality upon which clinical decisions can be made. However, quantitative measurement of hyperpolarized agents is currently difficult due to the restrictions imposed by the transient hyperpolarized state and the complexity inherent in biological systems. As more advanced imaging and measurement techniques are developed for imaging hyperpolarized substrates, {{it is critical to}} characterize their effect on any relevant quantitative measure. To assist in accurate quantitative measurement of hyperpolarized agents, an infrastructure where acquisition strategies can be developed, compared, optimized and validated was critically need. A novel simulation architecture was developed that combines classical chemical kinetics with the basic physics of nuclear magnetic resonance and couples them to multiple perfusion models. Simulation results showed that changes in the acquisition strategy used will affect the resulting quantification of chemical exchange rates and suggested that any bias that is imposed by the acquisition strategy can be avoided by using optimized pulse sequences. To validate these predictions, a phantom system was developed that allows controllable chemical conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate into lactate with a variability less than 20 %. Using this phantom system, studies showed that poorly optimized pulse sequences significantly reduced the measured value of the chemical exchange rates, whereas optimized pulse sequences showed no significant difference in chemical exchange measurements. In order to test simulation predictions for a perfused system, an <b>animal</b> <b>cohort</b> with orthotropic anaplastic thyroid cancer was scanned with multiple sequences. Again, optimized sequences showed no significant difference in measured exchange rates while poorly designed sequences significantly underestimated the exchange rates, which is consistent with the simulation results. These validation studies suggest that this simulation architecture will be a powerful tool for developing and optimizing acquisition and quantization methods for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prion diseases, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathies (BSE), are {{transmissible}} {{neurodegenerative disorders}} affecting humans {{and a wide}} variety of mammals. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a prion disease in humans, has been linked to exposure to BSE prions. This classical BSE (cBSE) is now rapidly disappearing as a result of appropriate measures to control animal feeding and monitoring. Besides cBSE, two atypical forms (named H- and L-type BSE) have recently been described in Europe, Japan, and North America. Here we describe the first wide-spectrum microarray analysis in whole blood of atypical BSE-infected cattle. Transcriptome changes in infected animals were analyzed prior to and after the onset of clinical signs. Some of the most significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR). AIM: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the transcriptome changes in whole blood from atypical BSE-infected animals prior and after the onset of the clinical signs to understand the peripheral mechanisms of prion infection and to line out some candidate genes that could be further investigated as biomarker of the disease. METHODS: Total RNA from whole blood samples from 8 intracranially BSE-challenged cattle (4 with H-type and 4 with L-type BSE) and 2 non-infected age- and sex-matched controls was isolated and subjected to the microarray analysis using the GeneChipÂ® Bovine Genome Array (Affymetrix). In order to increase the <b>animal</b> <b>cohort,</b> RNA samples from four additional sex-matched control cattle were isolated using the same protocol as the original study group and included in the final statistical analysis. Therefore, 24 RNA samples, divided in 8 preclinical (P 1, P 2, P 4, P 5, P 7, P 8, EP 9 and P 10), 8 clinical (S 1, S 2, S 3, S 4, S 7, S 8, S 9 and S 10), and 8 control (c 2, c 3, cP 3, c 5, cS 5, cP 6, cS 6 and c 9) samples, constituted our <b>animal</b> <b>cohort.</b> After the assessment and inspection of microarray quality controls (RNA degradation plot, RLE and NUSE plots) we identified one low quality control sample (cS 5) and excluded it from the final statistical analysis. Gene probes with a p value â‰¤ 0. 05 and fold-change â‰¥ 2 were considered to be differentially expressed. To confirm the microarray results, we performed RT-qPCR using SYBRÂ® green assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) for a selected number of target genes. The RT-qPCR analysis was performed on 22 samples (7 control, 8 preclinical and 7 clinical animals). The normalization accuracy was improved by geometric averaging of multiple reference genes (GAPDH, RPL 12 and ACTB) and using two inter-run calibrators to reduce inter-run variation. RESULTS: The microarray analysis revealed a total of 101 differentially regulated probe sets (p value lower than 0. 05 and changes in expression higher than 2 -fold) in infected animals (clinical and preclinical) versus control group. In the clinical stage, a total of 207 probe sets showed significant alteration in expression levels compared to the control group. Interestingly, a pronounced alteration in the gene expression profile was also found in the preclinical stage, with a total number of 113 differentially expressed probe sets. A set of 35 differentially expressed genes was found to be in common between clinical and preclinical stages and showed a very similar expression pattern in the two phases. To further dissect gene expression alterations during the progression of the disease, we performed a statistical analysis to identify specific changes between the clinical and preclinical stages (CvsP). Indeed, we found 235 DEGs, which were significantly enriched in pathways related to immune response. The comparison of all the analysis, revealed a 22 -gene signature with an up/down-down/up pattern of expression, being differentially expressed in preclinical stage and then going back to control levels in the symptomatic phase. One gene, SEL 1 L 3, was progressively downregulated during the progression of the disease. The identified genes belong to several pathways, such as immune response and metabolism, that may play an important role in prion pathogenesis. The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the microarray results for six out of nine genes selected (XIST, CD 40 L, GNLY, PDK 4, HBA 2 and SEL 1 L 3). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has led to the identification of several gene expression changes in whole blood from atypical BSE infected cattle prior and after the manifestation of the pathology. Our findings suggest that it might be feasible to use whole blood RNA transcriptional profiles to distinguish between preclinical and clinical stages of prion infection. Overall, our study confirmed the differential expression of 6 genes (XIST, CD 40 L, GNLY, PDK 4, HBA 2 and SEL 1 L 3), which may play several roles in atypical BSE pathogenesis and, possibly, in other prion infections. Even though further studies are required to investigate the specific involvement of all the identified genes in prion diseases, our data support the idea of a relationship of complicity and blindness between prion and the host immune system. As concluding remark, our study underlined the importance of utilizing whole blood, without any additional manipulation, as a source tissue for the development of a preclinical diagnostic test...|$|R

Between February 2001 and the end of 2014, a total of 1 [*] 879 [*] 749 cows were examined and 30 cases of the BSE were detected. Consequently, 4 [*] 243 cows in cohorts were killed and their carcasses were safely disposed of. The farmers whose herds had been affected were provided compensations for the losses suffered. The total of the compensations in this period reached EUR 7 [*] 752 [*] 000. Of these, 83. 3 â€¯% (EUR 6 [*] 458 [*] 000) were compensations for the value of the killed animals, 9. 7 â€¯% (EUR 752 [*] 000) for the related costs, i. e., killing, safe disposal of carcasses and the examination for the BSE, and 6. 9 â€¯% (EUR 535 [*] 000) for the losses due to non-materialised production.

50|$|This section {{summarizes}} {{the studies that}} have been conducted on animal subjects (such as rodents and non-human primates) that have been exposed either to spaceflight or (in the case of rodents) to the well accepted ground-based analog of hind-limb suspension (HS) to ascertain the effects of unloading states on the properties of muscle mass, strength, and endurance. The results presented herein overwhelmingly corroborate the body of evidence that has been reported on human subjects in the preceding sections of this report. Importantly, through the use of more cellular and molecular analyses, greater insights have been obtained into the underlying mechanisms associated with these alterations in muscle structure and function. Since the majority of evidence concerning the effects of spaceflight on mammalian skeletal muscle has been derived from rodent studies, the information provided here is focused mostly on the rodent model. It is {{important to point out that}} the structure and function of rodent skeletal muscle are nearly identical to those of human skeletal muscle. For example, rodent muscle is composed of the same general fiber-type profile and is sensitive to the same environmental (mechanical, hormonal, metabolic) cues observed for human muscle. Thus, the information summarized below provides credence to the data base derived from human subjects. However, it is important to point out that one primary advantage of the rodent model is that adaptive changes that occur in both species unfold in a much shorter time frame in rodents than in humans (hours to days versus days to weeks), making it possible to predict long-term changes in human skeletal muscle based on the shorter absolute time frame of the studies performed on rodents. Another important consideration in the context of animal research during spaceflight is that one can perform a straightforward experiment in which there is no requirement to provide some type of countermeasure intervention as there is for humans, and can thereby avoid the introduction of a confounding variable in ascertaining the true effects of spaceflight on a wide range of physiological variables. Also, given the remarkable agreement in the quantitative and qualitative nature of the findings observed in the spaceflight studies versus those obtained from ground-based HS studies, we have chosen to combine and integrate significant portions of the data that have been gathered in the last 25 years. This rodent data base in space life sciences research includes 14 flight experiments with 8 sponsored by the Russian Cosmos Program and 6 sponsored by NASA Space Life Sciences (SLS) and Space Transportation System (STS) missions. These flight experiments are complemented by numerous ground-based research studies that focused collectively on the topics described below. Most importantly, all of the data reported in this summary are derived from <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> in which the control animals were studied from a synchronous vivarium group of the same age, strain, and gender, and the analyses were performed at the same time as that of the experimental groups. The provided information is based entirely on peer-reviewed experiments as detailed in the bibliography provided.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to use in-situ nick {{translation}} (ISNT) to investigate the relative number of unrepaired nuclear (n) DNA nicks in different cell types in the brain of the 9 -month-old mouse after a 2 -month exposure to a 50 Hz magnetic field with 0 mT (control), 0. 1 mT or 1 mT. 5 minutes after the end of the magnetic field exposure, the mice were injected with 555 kBq Â³H-thymidine (TdR) per gram of body mass, in order to carry out additional UDS tests on these animals. Two hours after Â³H- TdR injection the animals were sacrificed, their organs removed and preserved with a fixative for several weeks. Paramedian sagittal paraffin sections were prepared with a thickness of 3 Âµm. To investigate the cell type-specific content of unrepaired nDNA nicks (i. e. DNA single strand breaks), the sections were subjected to an ISNT with DNA polymerase I and Â³H-thymidine triphosphate; finally autoradiograms were prepared. Under the microscope, at a 1250 x primary magnification, 100 successive cells per cell type were analyzed according to their nuclear grain numbers and a computer-assisted measurement of the corresponding nuclear profile area was performed. By correcting for background labelling and normalization to nuclear DNA content, a direct comparison between the new results and those of the literature was possible. It should bementioned that the grain numbers connted were analyzed using cumulative frequency distributions to identify possible artifacts. After calculating the mean of the remaining data, the <b>animal</b> <b>cohorts</b> were compared using univariance analysis and post-hoc t-tests with consideration of a Bonferroni correction. All results with of p < 0. 05 were considered as statistically significant. Finally, linear regression analyses were used with p< 0. 05 to compare the results with corresponding values of the literature. With respect to the content of unrepaired DNA nicks, this study yielded in the univariance analysis a statistically significant correlation to the magnetic field dose only for hippocampus granule cells. However, this results could not be confirmed with post-hoc t-test. On the other hand, however, the results of the UDS tests conducted in parallel (FÃ¼ller, 2009) showed that, if magnetic field-induced DNA damage had in fact occurred, this damage was repaired no more than 24 hours after switching off the magnetic field. In the case of cell types from the caudate nucleus (neurons, glial cells and endothelial cells), as well as the plexus epithelial cells in the lateral ventricle and (separately from it) in the IV ventricle, no clear significant result could be obtained. For the measured values of the nuclear profile areas which, according to the literature, are positively correlated with cell metabolism in the case of a globose nucleus, statistically reliable correlations were only detected for the neurons of the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus granule cells. The nuclear profile areas were significantly reduced here in comparison to the animals not exposed to a magnetic field, both for an exposure to 0. 1 mT and also to 1 mT. It is worthy to note that only the findings for the caudate nucleus were confirmed in the UDS test conducted in parallel (Braun, 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{project has}} {{explored}} {{the determinants of}} drug absorption following oral administration of lipid-based drug delivery systems (LBDDS) {{and the role of}} intestinal digestive processes on formulation performance. Particular focus has been directed to the role of formulation excipients and drug loading on the generation and maintenance of drug supersaturation during LBDDS processing and the subsequent impact on drug bioavailability. The data show that initiation of digestion by pancreatic enzymes functions as an effective supersaturation trigger and that addition of polymeric precipitation inhibitors (PPI) may be utilised to stabilise supersaturation for longer periods and therefore to enhance absorption. Formulation performance was highly correlated with the maximum degree of supersaturation that the formulation generated on dispersion and digestion. In vitro, increasing drug dose initially increased drug thermodynamic activity in the aqueous colloidal phases formed by formulation digestion. Above a critical drug loading, however, supersaturation â€˜pressureâ€™ increased to a point above which nucleation and crystal growth dominated, resulting in drug precipitation. The utilisation of lower drug loads, higher surfactant levels, reduced cosolvent and the addition of PPI all enhanced formulation performance in vitro (i. e. supported ongoing solubilisation), however, subsequent studies showed that only in some cases was the addition of PPI able to support enhanced absorption in vivo. Consistent with the potential for increases in thermodynamic activity with increase in drug dose, non-linear increases in bioavailability were evident after administration of a series of LBDDS containing increasing quantities of drug to beagle dogs. In further alignment with the in vitro data, non-linear increases in bioavailability were also only evident up to a critical point, beyond which further increases in drug dose resulted in a reduction in bioavailability. The initial in vivo studies were therefore highly consistent with the in vitro supersaturation data. Replication of the in vivo study in a younger <b>cohort</b> of <b>animals,</b> however, was not able to reproduce the same trends and linear increases in exposure with dose were apparent in this <b>animal</b> <b>cohort.</b> Further studies failed to show a significant difference in hepatic function across the two cohorts, and instead suggested that age-related changes in GI solubilisation, potentially through increased bile salt secretion in the older cohort, may have led to better stabilisation of supersaturation and therefore increases in danazol absorption. Increases in the quantity of drug absorbed at higher doses in the older cohort may have also magnified differences in exposure due to greater saturation of first pass metabolism. The latter data led to a more detailed evaluation of the role of drug dose on the bioavailability of danazol from LBDDS. These studies were conducted in rats to allow more direct exploration of the role of first pass metabolism, and gastric and intestinal processing on danazol bioavailability. Surprisingly, danazol exposure in the rat following oral administration of danazol formulated in similar LBDDS as those used in the dog studies was low (50 %) and that the principle limitation to danazol bioavailability in the rat is first pass metabolism. In summary, this thesis contributes {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which LBDDS promote drug solubilisation and absorption and specifically to the influence of drug dose, animal model and the inclusion of polymeric precipitation inhibitors (PPI) on supersaturation generation and stabilisation...|$|R

To study the efficacy of noncytotoxic therapy in this <b>animal</b> model, <b>cohorts</b> of naive immunocompetent mice were inoculated with primary murine APL cells from a frozen tumor bank. Arsenic trioxide and liposomally encapsulated all-trans-retinoic acid (Lipo ATRA), alone or in combination, were administered for 21 days by i. p. injection using doses that yielded plasma levels similar to those observed in human APL patients treated with these agents. Lipo ATRA was highly effective in inducing durable molecular remissions in immunocompetent mice [C 57 BL/ 6 Ã— C 3 H F 1 (B 6 C 3 HF 1) ]; arsenic therapy was much less effective, and did not clearly synergize with Lipo ATRA to increase the remission rate in immunocompetent mice. The survival of Lipo ATRA-treated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) animals (lacking functional T and B cells) was inferior to that of immunocompetent B 6 C 3 HF 1 recipients (40 % vs. 88 % survival at 1 y, P < 0. 001). These data suggest that adaptive immunity cooperates with pharmacologic therapy to induce or maintain remissions in murine APL. It also implies that immunosuppressive anti-leukemia therapies could paradoxically blunt effective anti-leukemia immune responses that are important for clearing small numbers of residual tumor cells after chemotherapy-mediated cytoreduction...|$|R
