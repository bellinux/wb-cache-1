Her father, who had pitched for the Kent State University team in the 1920s, was also an avid baseball fanatic and encouraged Lois by teaching her how to swing and catch, while she accustomed to play sandlot ball with the neighborhood kids.|$|E

25|$|Genie was the last, {{and second}} surviving, of four {{children}} of parents living in Arcadia, California, and was born in 1957 without any noted complications at a normal, healthy weight and size. Around {{the time of her}} birth, her father began to isolate himself and his family from other people. Her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded because she was late to walk due to treatment for a congenital hip dislocation, a view which intensified <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older, and consequently disliked her. He tried not to talk to or pay attention to her and discouraged his wife and son, who was five years older than Genie, from doing so.|$|E

25|$|Genie (born 1957) is the {{pseudonym}} for an American feral {{child who}} {{was a victim of}} severe abuse, neglect, and social isolation. Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of linguistics and abnormal child psychology. When she was a baby her father concluded that she was severely mentally retarded, a view which intensified <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older, causing him to dislike her and withhold care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible {{as a result of this}} belief, so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always kept her strapped to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished. The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.|$|E
500|$|During the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Jealous" [...] live {{during a}} medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. She performed the song {{dressed in a}} bodysuit and was backed by a clip. In {{a review of the}} performance, Nadeska Alexis felt that the singer managed to emphasize [...] "the weight of... lyrics" [...] while performing the song. Writing for Fuse, Hilary Hughes concluded that the rendition of the song was [...] "enough to halt all conversation, silence all phones and pause the internet for a moment, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> real right off the bat".|$|E
500|$|McCay stood barely {{five feet}} (...) tall, and felt {{dominated}} by his wife, who {{was nearly as}} tall as he was. McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour. [...] About a decade separated the couple's ages: Winsor was 24 and Maude only 14 when they married. Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay's birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenage girl. Maude was also notably age-conscious, as she preferred her grandchildren to call her [...] "Nan" [...] instead of [...] "Grandma" [...] and also dyed her hair <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older. The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker. Neither spouse got along well with the other's mother.|$|E

The video screen, resembling an electric mathematical grid, was eventually lifted during the performance. After the song, Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform [...] "Just Dance" [...] while emerging {{from the inside of}} a white cube on a platform. This was followed by a brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off-white costume, that resembled an alien ecto-skeleton, while the dancers wore skeletal headgear. She started performing [...] "LoveGame", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin. Flames appeared on the video screens, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> out of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed [...] "Alejandro", and was carried by her [...] crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.|$|E
500|$|Naz {{is one of}} {{four main}} {{characters}} from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: [...] "It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, {{which is one of the}} reasons I wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> into cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|Northanger Abbey {{was shot}} on {{location}} in Ireland from late August 2006. The Independent's Sarah Shannon stated that ITV had filmed in the country [...] "largely thanks to the generous tax incentives offered by the republic's government." [...] Filming lasted for five weeks and the drama was shot on Super 16 mm film. Twenty-first century Dublin streets doubled for nineteenth century Bath, the setting for the novel. Shannon thought some viewers might be annoyed with this and Thompson commented, [...] "But isn't that shot of the Royal Crescent in Bath {{a bit of a}} cliché? What we've done is create our own Bath." [...] Lismore Castle in County Waterford was chosen as Northanger Abbey, home of the Tilney family. Higginsbrook House, near County Meath, served as the exterior to the Morland family's home. The house was later used in Becoming Jane, a film about Austen's early life. Other shooting locations included Dublin Castle, Ardbraccan House and Charleville Castle. Jones told Paul Byrne of the Evening Herald that she enjoyed shooting in Ireland <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{to see a lot of}} the country.|$|E

500|$|The rising {{popularity}} of low-rise jeans led to increased exposure of thong tops {{in the early}} 2000s, which quickly became mainstream as a Gucci model revealed one on the catwalk, Melanie Blatt of All Saints was photographed showing her thong <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> out of a taxi, and Victoria Beckham suggested that her husband enjoyed her wearing her G-strings around the home. Britney Spears has been portrayed as {{a major contributor to}} the whale tail's popularity. Her whale tail display has been referred to in such creative literature books as Married to a Rock Star by Shemane Nugent, Thong on Fire by Noire, [...] The Magical Breasts of Britney Spears by Ryan G. Van Cleave, and Off-Color by Janet McDonald. The Oregonian, a Portland, Oregon, newspaper, wrote in 2004 that an abundance of whale tails had become a distraction on the campus. Social commentator Ann C. Hall identified this campus trend as an [...] "apparent intersection between everyday campus fashion and soft porn". The layered clothing trend of the early 2000s was partly led by the whale tail style that incorporates hip-hugger jeans, crop tops and high riding thongs popularized by celebrities.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{the first}} season, where the Wachowskis and Straczynski split {{the amount of}} scripts in half and worked {{remotely}} from each other (but with frequent meetings), writing for the second season was performed by Lana and Straczynski by collaborating inside a shared writers' room. The author of Cloud Atlas David Mitchell and the novelist and columnist Aleksandar Hemon worked as additional writers on the second season and were credited as [...] "consultants"; they also made a cameo appearance in an episode as themselves. Both writers came to know {{and work with the}} Wachowskis prior to Sense8. Lana became friends with Mitchell after adapting Cloud Atlas to film with her sister and Tom Tykwer, and was very surprised to read Mitchell's The Bone Clocks shortly before shooting the first season of Sense8 to find it strongly resembled [...] "Sense8 and Jupiter Ascending [...] together", even though they each wrote their works separately. Hemon first met the Wachowskis in 2009, when they interviewed him looking for inspiration to write a movie script they wanted, and in turn he profiled them and wrote about the making of Cloud Atlas for The New Yorker in 2012. For the second season of Sense8, Mitchell and Hemon were brought in to spend a week in September 2015 with Lana, Straczynski, and script supervisor Julie Brown, proposing to them situations, twists and turns, to be further developed by Lana and Straczynski. Afterwards {{and for the rest of}} the year, Mitchell and Hemon were regularly being tasked by Lana to write from distance select scenes on short deadlines, that she and Straczynski would further develop or reject. Hemon estimates he delivered around 120 pages, of which none made it to the second season's 700-paged script without changes. Later, once filming began, Lana did a lot of rewrites on a daily basis <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> inspired by the locations, actors, and so on, even on the set.|$|E

[...] She was arguably {{one of the most}} enterprising women in the city, the habit of working late at night giving her the nick [...] "The Evening Star" [...] and, in 1844, she became rich <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> to know about the death of King Charles XIV before her {{competitors}} and bought all the crapes and other mourning clothes in the city.

Winnie's two children, Alison and Norman, became closely involved in Rebecca's life <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older; Alison Macleod would achieve a literary career of her own. [...] West trained as an actress in London, taking the name [...] "Rebecca West" [...] from the rebellious young heroine in Rosmersholm by Henrik Ibsen. She and Lettie became involved in the women's suffrage movement, participating in street protests. Meanwhile, West worked as a journalist for the feminist weekly Freewoman and the Clarion, drumming up support for the suffragette cause.|$|E
2500|$|During Lively's childhood, {{her parents}} took her {{with them to}} acting classes that they taught {{because they did not}} want to leave her with a babysitter. Lively said that {{watching}} her parents teach acting classes helped her learn the [...] "drills" [...] of acting and gain confidence <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older. She was initially not particularly interested in acting, and wanted to attend Stanford University. During the summer between her junior and senior years of high school, her brother Eric asked his agent to send her on a few auditions over a period of a few months. From these auditions, she was cast as Bridget for The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Lively filmed her scenes in between her junior and senior years at Burbank High School. While at Burbank, Lively served as senior class president, a cheerleader, and a member of the championship choir.|$|E

Alexandra slipped into a coma from which she never emerged. Although doctors had no hope for Dmitri's survival, he still lived, with the help of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, who gave the premature Dmitri the baths that were prescribed by the doctors, wrapped him in cotton wool and kept him in a cradle filled with hot water bottles to keep his temperature regulated. [...] "I am enjoying raising Dmitri," [...] Sergei wrote in his diary. Alexandra died shortly after Dmitri's birth. She was only 21, and the cause was almost certainly preeclampsia.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson was {{passionate about}} music {{from a young}} age and even asked her mother how anyone could live without it.

[...] Her parents played country music records by Jim Reeves and Don Williams at home and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> older, her musical interests diversified as she listened to artists like ABBA, Charley Pride, Fleetwood Mac and Marty Stuart among others. The family later moved to Westlock, Alberta and Johnson attended RF Staples High School there. During her high school years, she learned to play the clarinet, flute and saxophone. She kept up her piano lessons largely in part due to Thiessan sending books and encouraging letters to her. [...] Her high school teachers were not as encouraging and caused her to turn away from music for a while and turn to science, a period in her life which she called [...] "a stain in her heart".|$|E

[...] "From the time I received my first check for my poems, I made up my mind to open my hand wide to those who needed assistance". Throughout her life, she was described as having [...] "a horror of wealth", never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and [...] "what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> it". She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby's sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.|$|E
