5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues {{differed}} in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. British {{rhythm and blues}} singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles, with shouts, glottal stops, moans <b>and</b> <b>cries.</b> However, vocalists such as Van Morrison, Mick Jagger, Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood {{did not attempt to}} emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power. In cover versions of R songs, riffs were often simplified or used less frequently. The object of the music was usually to whip up energy, rather than to produce musical finesse. Many groups were based around guitars (rhythm, lead and bass) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar-oriented and at higher tempos than the originals. Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over-driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia.

25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), <b>and</b> Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> gene coding sequences. The level of PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|R

5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E

40|$|Insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins to yellow and striped rice stem borers (Sciropophaga incertulas and Chilo suppresalis, respectively) were investigated. Yellow stem borer (YSB) was susceptible to Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins with similar toxicities. To striped stem borer (SSB), Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C were more toxic than Cry 1 Aa toxin.

25|$|In Yayoi Kusama’s Walking Piece (1966), a {{performance}} that was documented {{in a series}} of eighteen color slides, Kusama walks along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono with a parasol. The kimono suggests traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, is made to look inauthentic as it is really a black umbrella painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walks down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turns <b>and</b> <b>cries</b> without reason, and eventually walks away and vanishes from view. This performance, through the association of the kimono, involves the stereotypes that Asian American women continue to face.
