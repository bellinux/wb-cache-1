40|$|The {{ability of}} the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> (a distillation product obtained from coal tar) was demonstrated. Analysis by capillary gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that at least 22 PAHs, including all of the most abundant PAH components present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> underwent 70 to 100 % disappearance during 27 days of incubation with nutrient nitrogen-limited cultures of this fungus. Because phenanthrene is the most abundant PAH present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> this PAH was selected for further study. In experiments in which [14 C]phenanthrene was incubated with cultures of P. chrysosporium containing <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> for 27 days, it was shown that 7. 7 % of the recovered radiolabeled carbon originally present in [14 C]phenanthrene was metabolized to 14 CO 2 and 25. 2 % was recovered from the aqueous fraction, while 56. 1 and 11. 0 % were recovered from the methylene chloride and particulate fractions, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography of the 14 C-labeled material present in the methylene chloride fraction revealed that most (91. 9 %) of this material was composed of polar metabolites of [14 C]phenanthrene. These results suggest that this microorganism may be useful for the decontamination of sites in the environment contaminated with PAHs...|$|R

40|$|The main {{feedstocks}} for {{the production}} of oil-furnace carbon black are different kinds of liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and utilization of oil-furnace carbon black mainly depends on the type of liquid hydrocarbons contained in the oil feedstocks. In practice, both carbochemical and petrochemical oils are used as feedstock sources. Carbochemical <b>oils</b> are <b>fractions</b> obtained during coal tar distillation. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is one of these oils. Depending on the conditions of distillation, coal tars contain up to w = 18 · 10 – 2 highly aromatic fractions, which can be used as carbon black feedstock. The sulphur <b>fraction</b> of these <b>oils</b> can vary between w = 0. 5 and 0. 7 · 10 – 2, depending on the origin of the coal. The availability of carbochemical oils obtained from coal tar is largely dependent on the production of coke used in the manufacture of steel. The quantities available today are insufficient to satisfy the demand for carbon black feedstock. In addition, in highly industrialized countries, production of carbochemicaloils is declining. Although, carbochemical oils are preferred in terms of efficiency, petrochemical oils are more important in terms of quantities available, particularly in the production of furnace blacks. These are residual oils resulting either from catalytic cracking processes or from the production of olefins in steam crackers using naphtha or gas oil as raw material. Nevertheless, the choice of carbon black feedstock is not determined merely by price and efficiency, but also by specific quality criteria. However, due to their origin, the feedstocks are mixtures {{of a large number of}} individual substances and are, therefore, not easy to characterize. More than 200 different components have been recorded in the range detectable by gas chromatography. Some important components of carbon black feedstock are listed in table 1. 1 An important parameter for the evaluation of carbon black feedstock is density, since it increases with increasing aromaticity. It is also used for determination of the Bureau of Mines Correlation Index (BMCI), 2 which is obtained either from density and midboiling point, or from density andviscosity for those feedstocks which cannot be distilled completely. This index is used by the carbon black industry as an important criteria for feedstock evaluation. The sulphur fraction in feedstocks should not exceed w = 2. 5 · 10 – 2, because a higher content greatly affects the quality of carbon black, pollutes the atmosphere, and accelerates corrosion of the facility. The maximum sulphur content in the typical hydrocarbon feedstock is w = 1. 2 · 10 – 2. 3. A very important factor of hydrocarbon feedstock is the fraction of alkaline earth metals, especially sodium and potassium. The maximum sodium fraction may be w = 20 · 10 – 6, while the maximum potassium fraction is w = 2 · 10 – 6. The maximum fraction of asphalthenes is w = 15 · 10 – 2. Asphalthenes, determined as pentane-insoluble matter, provide indications concerning the possibility of grit formation. Another very important factor is the temperature range of distillation, which should be low enough, because the hydrocarbon feedstock must evaporize before entering the hot region of the reactor. The viscosity, the pour point, and for safety reasons, the flash point determines the handling properties and storage conditions of the feedstock. In addition, the water fraction in the hydrocarbon feedstock is one of the most important factors. The water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock influences the handling properties of the same. The maximum water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock may be w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, and desirably below w = 1. 0 · 10 – 2. A higher water fraction represent a considerable impact on the financial construction. Also, it is very difficult to manipulate such feedstock, especially unloading, and in the production of oil-furnace carbon black. Namely, every water fraction higher than w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2 in the hydrocarbon feedstock, causes the phenomenon of cavitations. In the oil-furnace carbon black plant of Petrokemija d. d. Kutina, the storage tank TK 48003, was filled with 800 tons of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> The average water fraction in the tank was w = 10 · 10 – 2. It was impossible to manipulate in the process of production, because the mentioned water fraction caused the cavitations effect. Therefore, it was necessary to decrease the water fraction to below w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, which will be satisfactory for production. As the water and <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> formed a homogeneous emulsion (similar density at all temperatures), it was impossible to manage decanting the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Additionally, it was impossible to manage evaporation of the water from the oil by heating the whole emulsion,because the flash point of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is in the temperature range of T = 100 to 105 °C. Distillation of the whole emulsion of 800 tons was also impossible, because there was no distillation column adequate for separating the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, the use of different demulsifiers proved as a potential solution for separating the homogeneous mixture of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> and water. Namely, demulsifiers are a special type of high molecular tensides and organic solvents, which serve for separation the water from different hydrocarbons. The most common use is in emulsions with “lighter” hydrocarbons, especially when the density is not above r= 0. 850 g cm – 3. Since the density of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> ranges from r= 1. 05 to 1. 09 g cm – 3, it was necessary to customise the conditions of application, and to choose the mostadequate demulsifier for the separation of water from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, we experimented with different kinds of demulsifiers in cooperation with the companies TEH PROJEKT KEMO d. o. o. and KEM PROJEKT d. o. o.

40|$|When certain {{oils and}} {{polymers}} are heated under an inert atmosphere, a high viscosity liquid forms. Examples include crude oil, coal tar, and PVC. Upon further heating, this liquid becomes a progressively harder solid called pitch. Pitch that contains crystalline areas is called mesophase pitch. Mesophase pitch {{is required for}} the production of graphite. The purpose of the research was to investigate whether <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> can be used for the production of mesophase pitch for sintering purposes. Sintering involves heating a powder under pressure to produce a solid. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is a low-value by-product of coke production from coal. Despite its low market value, it has unique properties. It consists primarily of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and it is free of primary quinoline insoluble material. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the precursors for mesophase pitch formation, while quinoline insoluble material hinders mesophase growth. These attributes make it a good potential starting material for the production of mesophase pitch, which may be used for sintering and carbon fibre production. In the search for a mesophase pitch that can be sintered, a variety of pitches were produced from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> This was done by varying the heat treatment time and temperature. The pitches produced were characterised to determine their glass transition temperature, melting temperature, carbon yield and optical microstructure. This was done to determine their sintering potential. A high mesophase content, high softening temperature and high carbonisation yield were considered essential for effective sintering. Pitches with a high mesophase content were produced. Longer heat treatment led to higher carbon yields, higher glass transition temperatures, higher softening temperatures and higher mesophase content.

50|$|Oil {{is largely}} {{composed}} of hydrocarbons which can burn if ignited. Still another important property of motor oil is its flash point, the lowest temperature {{at which the}} oil gives off vapors which can ignite. It is dangerous for {{the oil in a}} motor to ignite and burn, so a high flash point is desirable. At a petroleum refinery, fractional distillation separates a motor <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> from other crude <b>oil</b> <b>fractions,</b> removing the more volatile components, and therefore increasing the oil's flash point (reducing its tendency to burn).|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to present the key {{findings}} on the effects of small salt-water fraction component, β expressed in volume % per L on rotation are presented in the temperature range of 19. 0 to 24. 0 ºC. It was found that rotations in oils with low boiling point known as light oils like Final diesel No. 2 were greater than the rotations which occurred in oils with high boiling point called heavy oils such as Esso diesel. Small <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> components, γs expressed in mL/L of salt water down to 10 ppm were detected. The greatest impact on rotation of these oils was found in light oils like Fina No. 2 diesel. At 40 ppm which is the oil content level below which the environment authority considers process water to be free from oil environmental hazards, the observed rotation angles were 23. 2 º for Esso, 36. 7 º for Nors Hydro AS, and 71. 8 º in Fina No. 2 diesel. It was observed that light oils molecules have drastic effect on optical properties of the mixture in which they exist. It was found that for all <b>oils,</b> <b>oil</b> <b>fractions</b> greater than 100 ppm, caused the medium to be optically dense. This technology has shown a very high potential of being used as an environmental monitor to detect <b>oil</b> <b>fractions</b> down to 10 ppm and the technique can use laser beam to control re-injected process water with <b>oil</b> <b>fractions</b> between 100 - 2000 ppm...|$|R

Sequential isolation was expected to capture diverse degrading capabilities of indigenous bacteria for different <b>oil</b> <b>fractions</b> (Halim et al. 2008). The first stage would isolate bacteria that can degrade light-oil fractions, whereas the second stage would isolate bacteria that metabolized a heavier <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> as substrate.

40|$|Effect of {{silicone}} <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> {{and stirring}} rate on methane degradation in a stirred tank reactor José Rocha-Rios, a Raúl Muñoz b and Sergio Revah c∗ BACKGROUND: Methane {{is an important}} greenhouse gas and its biological oxidation constitutes a cost-effective alternative for low concentration emissions. Nevertheless, due to its low aqueous solubility (similar to oxygen), gas mass transfer is often the limiting step. Two-phase partition bioreactors (TPPBs), have been proposed to increase the biodegradation of poorly soluble compounds. In this work, the effect of stirring rate and silicone <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> on abiotic volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient kLaO 2 and methane elimination capacity (EC) by a methanotrophic consortium in a stirred tank was studied. RESULTS: In abiotic conditions, the kLaO 2 increased when increasing both factors. Nevertheless, {{a negative effect on}} kLaO 2 was observed with silicone oil at the highest stirring rate (800 rpm). During methane biodegradation experiments, EC also improved when increasing both factors, but contrary to abiotic kLaO 2, it was not affected at the highest stirring rate. While stirring rate was the dominant variable determining methane biodegradation, the effect of <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> was only significant above 200 rpm. A maximum EC improvement of 700 % was observed when increasing stirring rate from 200 to 800 rpm with 10 % of silicone oil. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing both stirring rate and <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> enhanced EC. The results were different from those observed with kLaO 2 suggesting that kLa is not sufficient to describe properly the mass transfer in TPPB because other factors (interfacial contact between the phases and physicochemical properties of organic phase) should be considered...|$|R

Lipids were thoroughly analysed to evaluate changes in fatty acid composition and {{trans fatty acid}} isomers, non-volatile oxidation compounds including oxidised, dimeric and polymeric triacylglycerols, and tocopherol. No significant changes in either of the parameters examined were found in total lipids extracted from infant formula along the storage period. However, the minor free <b>oil</b> <b>fractions</b> (about 7. 5 % of total lipids) showed {{a significant increase in}} oxidation compounds and marked decrease in tocopherol levels during storage at all temperatures. Samples stored at 37 °C for 3 months were rancid and, accordingly, contained the highest oxidation level in the free <b>oil</b> <b>fraction,</b> whereas total lipids extracted were apparently not oxidised.

5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone dissolved in glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The <b>oil</b> <b>fraction</b> can then be dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then dissolved in a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|R
