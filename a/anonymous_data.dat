MBRRACE-UK has approximately 100 assessors from different specialty groups including obstetrics, anaesthesia, intensive care, midwifery, pathology, psychiatry, general practice, emergency medicine, obstetric medicine, neurology, infectious diseases and cardiology. Each maternal death case is typically looked at by between ten and fifteen expert reviewers. All of the assessors for the CEMD are volunteers who are not remunerated for their work.|$|E

50|$|Peer-to-peer {{direct and}} {{anonymous}} distribution overlay (P2PRIV) was a conceptual anonymous peer-to-peer overlay network introduced at Warsaw University of Technology in 2007. P2PRIV hides an initiator of communications by a parallelization of network nodes receiving or sending user data independently. This concept {{is contrary to}} other anonymity networks topologies. The anonymity networks employ a serial communication as a common basis and hide the initiator in a cascade of network nodes forwarding user data consecutively. The main advantage of P2PRIV {{is viewed as a}} possibility of providing high-speed <b>anonymous</b> <b>data</b> transfer while <b>anonymous</b> <b>data</b> can be sent directly and independently in the distributed network.|$|E

50|$|Deanonymisation is a {{strategy}} in data mining in which <b>anonymous</b> <b>data</b> is cross-referenced with other sources of data to re-identify the <b>anonymous</b> <b>data</b> source. Along with transaction graph analysis, which may reveal connections between bitcoin addresses (pseudonyms), there is a possible attack which links a user's pseudonym to its IP address. If the peer is using Tor, the attack includes a method to separate the peer from the Tor network, forcing them to use their real IP address for any further transactions. The attack makes use of bitcoin mechanisms of relaying peer addresses and anti-DoS protection. The cost {{of the attack on}} the full bitcoin network is under €1500 per month.|$|E
