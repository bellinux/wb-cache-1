5|$|By {{reading the}} book, Gray learns that Léone {{is a victim}} of a Vampyr. Vampyrs can force humans into submission. The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> recognizes him as the old man he saw in the castle. The doctor tells Gray that a blood {{transfusion}} is needed <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> offers his blood to save Léone. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray sleeps. He wakes sensing danger and rushes to Léone, where he surprises the doctor as he is attempting to poison the girl. The doctor flees the manor, <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> finds that Gisèle is gone. Gray follows the doctor back to the castle, where Gray has a vision of himself being buried alive. After the vision subsides, he rescues Gisèle but the doctor escapes. The old servant of the manor finds Gray's Vampyr book and discovers that a Vampyr can be defeated by driving an iron bar through its heart. The servant meets Gray at Marguerite Chopin's grave behind the village Chapel. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved. They hammer a large metal bar through her heart, killing her. The village doctor is hiding in an old mill, but finds himself locked in a chamber where flour sacks are filled. The old servant arrives and activates the mill's machinery, filling the chamber with flour and suffocating the doctor. The curse of the Vampyr is lifted and Léone suddenly recovers. Gisèle <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> cross a foggy river by boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.|$|E

25|$|These {{formations}} come in {{many different}} brilliant colors such as reds, browns, blues, <b>and</b> <b>grays.</b> The reds <b>and</b> browns are caused {{by the presence of}} iron oxide in the formation.

5|$|In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, {{the color}} of {{clothing}} showed a person's social rank and profession.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert <b>and</b> <b>gray</b> were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained for measuring blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Sid {{finds the}} eighth spirit at the crater {{site of the}} alien asteroid's impact on Earth. He lowers a {{shielded}} vehicle, with Aki <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> aboard, into the crater to locate the final spirit. Just before they can reach it, Hein fires the Zeus cannon into the crater, not only destroying the eighth spirit but also revealing the Phantom Gaia. Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she <b>and</b> <b>Gray</b> combine it with the other seven. Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E

5|$|A herd of elk was {{introduced}} to the watershed shortly before November 2000. Black bears have also been observed in the watershed.

The Allegheny Wood Rat has the potential to inhabit much of the watershed except for the northwestern part.|$|E

5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals <b>and</b> <b>gray</b> whales generally have a flat head, long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E
