40|$|It {{has long}} been sought to measure ocular {{accommodation}} continuously in human factor applications such as driving or flying. Open-field <b>autorefractors</b> such as the Canon R- 1 could be converted to allow continuous, objective recording, but steady eye fixation and head immobilisation were essential for the measurements to be valid. Image analysis techniques utilised by newer open-view <b>autorefractors</b> such as the Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 are more tolerant to head and eye movements, but perhaps the technique with the greatest potential for the measurement of accommodation in human factor applications is photoretinoscopy. This paper examines the development of techniques for high temporal measurements of accommodation and reports on the tolerance of one such recent commercial instrument, the PowerRefractor (PlusOptiX). The instrument {{was found to be}} tolerant to eye movements from the optical axis of the instrument (∼ 0. 50 DS change in apparent accommodation with gaze 25 ° eccentric to the optical axis), longitudinal head movement (< 0. 25 DS from 8 cm towards and 20 cm away from the correct photorefractor to eye distance) and changes in background illuminance (< 0. 25 DS from 0. 5 to 20 cd m- 2 target luminance). The PowerRefractor also quantifies the direction of gaze and pupil size, but is unable to take measurements with small pupils < 3. 7 ± 1. 0 mm. © 2002 The College of Optometrists...|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of autorefractors calculate the vision correction a patient needs (refraction) by using sensors that detect the reflections from a cone of infrared light. These reflections {{are used to}} determine {{the size and shape of}} a ring in the retina at the back of the eye. By measuring this zone, the <b>autorefractor</b> can determine when a patient’s eye properly focuses an image. The instrument changes its magnification until the image comes into focus. The process is repeated in at least three meridians of the eye and the <b>autorefractor</b> calculates the refraction of the eye, sphere, cylinder and axis. Modern autorefractors are based on the idea patented by Medina.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. We {{assessed}} the prevalence and predictors of inaccurate refractive error among rural refractionists in western China. METHODS. A subset of primary school {{children with visual}} acuity (VA) = 1 eye, undergoing subjective refinement by local refractionists after cycloplegic autorefraction in an ongoing population-based study, received repeat refraction by university optometrists for quality control. RESULTS. Among 502 children (mean age 10. 5 years, 53. 2 % girls), independent predictors of poor (inaccurate by >= 1. 0 diopter [D]) refraction by 21 rural practitioners (66. 7 % with high school or lower education) included hyperopia (odds ratio [OR], 4. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 4 - 7. 3, P 6 / 12 by the rural refractionist (OR = 4. 7; 95 % CI, 3. 1 - 7. 3; P = = 1 eye by the rural refractionists, vision could be improved to > 6 / 12 by the university optometrist in 110 (54. 7 %). We estimate vision could be so improved in 9. 1 % of all children refracted by these rural refractionists. A reason for inaccuracy in this setting is the erroneous tendency of rural refractionists to adjust instrument values for accommodation, even under cycloplegia. CONCLUSIONS. Rural refractionists in western China have little formal training and frequently fail to optimize VA among children, even when <b>autorefractors</b> are used. Training is needed emphasizing better use of automated refraction, particularly in children with astigmatism and hyperopia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Purpose. Despite the {{proliferation}} of wavefront sensors to characterize the optical quality of individual eyes, there is not yet an accurate way to determine from a wave aberration how severely it will impact the patient’s vision. Some {{of the most commonly}} used metrics, such as RMS wavefront error and the Strehl ratio, predict subjective image quality poorly. Our goal is to establish a better metric to predict subjective image quality from the wave aberration. Methods. We describe three kinds of experiments designed to compare the effectiveness of different metrics in determining the subjective impact of the wave aberration. Subjects viewed a visual stimulus through a deformable mirror in an adaptive optics system that compensated for the subject’s wave aberration. In the first experiment, we show that some Zernike modes such as spherical aberration and defocus interact strongly in determining subjective image quality. In the second experiment, the subject’s wave aberration was replaced by the wave aberration corresponding to an individual Zernike mode. The subject then adjusted the coefficient of the Zernike mode to match the blur of a standard stimulus. In the third experiment, the subject viewed the same stimulus through the wave aberration of one of 59 different postoperative patients who had undergone LASIK and matched the blur by adjusting defocus. We then determined which among many image quality metrics best predicted these matching data. Results. RMS wavefront error was a poor predictor of the data, as was the Strehl ratio. Conclusions. The neural sharpness metric best described the subjective sharpness of images viewed through the wave aberrations of real eyes. This metric can provide a single number that describes the subjective impact of each patient’s wave aberration and will also increase the accuracy of refraction estimates from wavefront-based <b>autorefractors</b> and phoropters.

40|$|Refractive error, one of {{the leading}} cause of visual impairment, can be {{corrected}} by simple interventions like prescribing eyeglasses. We trained a deep learning algorithm to predict refractive error from the fundus photographs from participants in the UK Biobank cohort, which were 45 degree field of view images and the AREDS clinical trial, which contained 30 degree field of view images. Our model use the "attention" method to identify features that are correlated with refractive error. Mean absolute error (MAE) of the algorithm's prediction compared to the refractive error obtained in the AREDS and UK Biobank. The resulting algorithm had a MAE of 0. 56 diopters (95 % CI: 0. 55 - 0. 56) for estimating spherical equivalent on the UK Biobank dataset and 0. 91 diopters (95 % CI: 0. 89 - 0. 92) for the AREDS dataset. The baseline expected MAE (obtained by simply predicting the mean of this population) was 1. 81 diopters (95 % CI: 1. 79 - 1. 84) for UK Biobank and 1. 63 (95 % CI: 1. 60 - 1. 67) for AREDS. Attention maps suggested that the foveal region was {{one of the}} most important areas used by the algorithm to make this prediction, though other regions also contribute to the prediction. The ability to estimate refractive error with high accuracy from retinal fundus photos has not been previously known and demonstrates that deep learning can be applied to make novel predictions from medical images. Given that several groups have recently shown that it is feasible to obtain retinal fundus photos using mobile phones and inexpensive attachments, this work may be particularly relevant in regions of the world where <b>autorefractors</b> may not be readily available...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{compare the}} {{objective}} accommodative amplitude and dynamics of eyes implanted with the one-compartment-unit (1 CU; HumanOptics AG, Erlangen, Germany) accommodative intraocular lenses (IOLs) with that measured subjectively. METHODS. Twenty {{eyes with a}} 1 CU accommodative IOL implanted were refracted and distance and near acuity measured with a logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) chart. The objective accommodative stimulus-response curve for static targets between 0. 17 and 4. 00 D accommodative demand was measured with the SRW- 5000 (Shin-Nippon Commerce Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and PowerRefractor (PlusOptiX, Nürnberg, Germany) <b>autorefractors.</b> Continuous objective recording of dynamic accommodation was measured with the SRW- 5000, with the subject viewing a target moving from 0 to 2. 50 D at 0. 3 Hz through a Badal lens system. Wavefront aberrometry measures (Zywave; Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) were made through undilated pupils. Subjective amplitude of accommodation was measured with the RAF (Royal Air Force accommodation and vergence measurement) rule. RESULTS. Four months after implantation best-corrected acuity was - 0. 01 ± 0. 16 logMAR at distance and 0. 60 ± 0. 09 logMAR at near. Objectively, the static amplitude of accommodation was 0. 72 ± 0. 38 D. The average dynamic amplitude of accommodation was 0. 71 ± 0. 47 D, with a lag behind the target of 0. 50 ± 0. 48 seconds. Aberrometry showed a decrease in power of the lens-eye combination from the center to the periphery in all subjects (on average, - 0. 38 ± 0. 28 D/mm). Subjective amplitude of accommodation was 2. 24 ± 0. 42 D. Two years after 1 CU implantation, refractive error and distance visual acuity remained relatively stable, but near visual acuity, and the subjective and objective amplitudes of accommodation decreased. CONCLUSIONS. The objective accommodating effects of the 1 CU lens appear to be limited, although patients are able to track a moving target. Subjective and objective accommodation was reduced at the 2 -year follow-up. The greater subjective amplitude of accommodation is likely to result from the eye's depth of focus of and the aspheric nature of the IOL.

40|$|Purpose]: To {{introduce}} a novel <b>autorefractor</b> design that {{is intended to}} be manufacturable at low cost and evaluate its performance in measuring refractive errors. [Methods]: We developed a handheld, open-view <b>autorefractor</b> (the ''QuickSee'' [QS]) that uses a simplified approach to wavefront sensing that forgoes moving parts and expensive components. Adult subjects (n = 41) were recruited to undergo noncycloplegic refraction with three methods: (1) a QS prototype, (2) a Grand Seiko WR- 5100 K (GS) <b>autorefractor,</b> and (3) subjective refraction (SR). Agreements between the QS and GS were evaluated using a Bland-Altman analysis. The accuracy of both autorefractors was evaluated using SR as the clinical gold standard. [Results]: The spherical equivalent powers measured from both autorefractors correlate well with SR, with identical correlation coefficients of r = 0. 97. Both autorefractors also agree well with each other, with a spherical equivalent power 95 % confidence interval of T 0. 84 diopters (D). The difference between the accuracy of each objective device is not statistically significant for any component of the power vector (p = 0. 55, 0. 41, and 0. 18, for M, J 0, and J 45, respectively). The spherical and cylindrical powers measured by the GS agree within 0. 25 D of the SR in 49 and 82 % of the eyes, respectively, whereas the spherical and cylindrical powers measured by the QS agree within 0. 25 D of the SR in 74 and 87 % of the eyes, respectively.

40|$|The {{oldest and}} most {{prevalent}} optical {{system in the world}} is the human eye. Variations in the anatomical structure of the eye can cause errors in its optical performance, which in turn lead to errors in the overall performance of the visual system. Fortunately, these refractive errors can be measured and then corrected externally with spectacles, contact lenses, or refractive surgery. This dissertation describes the design, fabrication, and testing of a new <b>autorefractor</b> {{that can be used to}} objectively measure human refractive error. The new <b>autorefractor</b> is based on Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensing techniques and uses a novel, Fourier transform-based algorithm to estimate refractive error.

It represents a significant improvement in automated clinical refraction because it can make accurate measurements of a wide range of refractive errors without relying on moving parts or the intensity of light reflected off the retina.

ResultsMean accommodative effort measured for 149 children {{included in the study}} was − 0. 63 ± 0. 69 D and dynamic refraction was − 0. 07 ± 0. 44 D before cycloplegia, while the mean was+ 0. 52 D after cycloplegia, irrespective of the method used. <b>Autorefractor</b> measured − 0. 17 D of accommodative effort per unit change in dynamic refraction before cycloplegia and + 0. 90 D after cycloplegia. ConclusionsThe performance of TOPCON AR RM- 8000 B <b>autorefractor</b> was comparable to dynamic retinoscopy. Presence of many children, and in turn, large number of accommodative response data in 11 – 13 and 14 – 15 years group is probably linked to prolonged reading/writing.

40|$|Purpose: The Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 {{is an open}} view <b>autorefractor</b> that {{superseded}} the Canon R- 1 <b>autorefractor</b> in the mid- 1990 s and {{has been}} used widely in optometry and vision science laboratories. It {{has been used to}} measure refractive error, accommodation responses both statically and dynamically, off-axis refractive error, and adapted to measure pupil size. This paper presents an overview of the original 2001 clinical evaluation of the SRW- 5000 in adults (Mallen et al., Ophthal Physiol Opt 2001; 21 : 101) and provides an update on the use and modification of the instrument since the original publication. Recent findings: The SRW- 5000 instrument, and the family of devices which followed, have shown excellent validity, repeatability, and utility in clinical and research settings. The instruments have also shown great potential for increased research functionality following a number of modifications. Summary: The SRW- 5000 and its derivatives have been, and continue to be, of significant importance in our drive to understand myopia progression, myopia control techniques, and oculomotor function in human vision...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} the repeatability {{and validity of}} the PowerRefractor and the Nidek AR- 600 A <b>autorefractor.</b> This is the first independent study conducted on adults to evaluate the performance of these instruments in a laboratory setting. Fifty subjects (23 males and 27 females) aged 16 to 61 years (mean, 37 ± 12) participated in the study. The validity of the PowerRefractor and the Nidek <b>autorefractor</b> readings were determined by comparing them to subjective refraction. Measurements of refractive error were obtained from the two instruments on two separate occasions to assess their repeatability. The measured refractive error was converted into a dioptric power matrix for data analysis. No significant difference was found between the measurements obtained with the two instruments and the subjective refraction. The estimate of refractive error given by the two instruments was also found to be repeatable. In addition to measuring the refractive error, the PowerRefractor also offers the facility to measure eye position, pupil size, and dynamics of accommodation. We suggest some improvements to the PowerRefractor measurement technique to standardize its clinical use and to improve accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the operation of}} the Shin-Nippon/Grand Seiko <b>autorefractor</b> and whether higher-order aberrations affect its peripheral refraction measurements. Methods: Information on instrument design, together with parameters and equations used to obtain refraction, was obtained from a patent. A model eye simulating the operating principles was tested with an optical design program. Effects of induced defocus and astigmatism on the retinal image were used to calibrate the model eye to match the patent equations. Coma and trefoil were added to assess their effects on the image. Peripheral refraction of a physical model eye was measured along four visual field meridians with the Shin-Nippon SRW- 5000 and a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer, and simulated <b>autorefractor</b> peripheral refraction was derived using the Zernike coefficients from the aberrometer. Results: In simulation, the autorefractor’s square image was changed in size by defocus, into rectangles or parallelograms by astigmatism, and into irregular shapes by coma and trefoil. In the presence of 1. 0 D oblique astigmatism, errors in refraction were proportional to the higher-order aberrations, with up to 0. 8 D sphere and 1. 5 D cylinder for ± 0. 6 µm of coma or trefoil coefficients with a 5 mm diameter pupil. For the physical model eye, refraction with the aberrometer was similar in all visual field meridians, but refraction with the <b>autorefractor</b> changed more quickly along one oblique meridian and less quickly along the other oblique meridian, than along the horizontal and vertical meridians. Simulations predicted that higher-order aberrations would affect refraction in oblique meridians, and this was supported by experimental measurements with the physical model eye. Conclusions: The autorefractor’s peripheral refraction measurements are valid for horizontal and vertical field meridians, but not for oblique field meridians. Similar instruments must be validated before being adopted outside their design scope...|$|E
