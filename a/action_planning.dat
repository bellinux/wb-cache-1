25|$|On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan {{published}} its {{views on}} the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents. Instead of the 10-kilometer evacuation-zone previously thought to be sufficient to protect inhabitants, a circle of 30 kilometer was proposed as Urgent Protective <b>Action</b> <b>Planning</b> Zones, or UPZ. This definition was {{in line with the}} emergency response requirements proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate {{in the event of an}} accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent internal exposure to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities. Implementation of this plan would mean a major review of all anti-nuclear disaster programs by local governments, and it would increase the number of municipalities involved up to around 130, about three times more than the present figure.|$|E
25|$|When {{accounting}} for the costs (both real costs, such as time taken to select and recruit a replacement, and also opportunity costs, such as lost productivity), the cost of employee turnover to for-profit organizations has been estimated to be between 30% (the figure used by the American Management Association) to upwards of 150% of the employees' remuneration package. There are both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs relate to the leaving costs, replacement costs and transitions costs, and indirect costs relate {{to the loss of}} production, reduced performance levels, unnecessary overtime and low morale. The true cost of turnover is going to depend on a number of variables including ease or difficulty in filling the position {{and the nature of the}} job itself. Estimating the costs of turnover within an organization can be a worthwhile exercise, especially since “turnover costs” are unlikely to appear in an organization’s balance sheets. Some of the direct costs can be readily calculated, while the indirect costs can often be more difficult to determine and may require “educated guesses.” Nevertheless, calculating even a rough idea of the total expenses relating to turnover can spur <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> within an organization to improve the work environment and reduce turnover. Surveying employees at the time they leave an organization can also be an effective approach to understanding the drivers of turnover within a particular organization.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: An <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> is an {{agreement}} between clinician and patient that the patient will make a spe-cific behavior change. The goals {{of this study are}} to: determine whether it is feasible for patients to make <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> in the primary care visit; determine whether patients report carrying out their action plans; and describe the <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> patients choose. Methods: Forty-three clinicians in 8 primary care sites were recruited to hold action-plan discus-sions with patients. Research assistants contacted patients by telephone 3 weeks later to assess whether patients had conducted their <b>action</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Eighty-three percent of enrolled patients (228) made an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> during a primary care visit. Of the 79 % who recalled making the <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> when interviewed by telephone 3 weeks later, 56 % recalled the details of their <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> and an additional 33 % recalled the general nature of the <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> At least 53 % of patients making an <b>action</b> <b>plan</b> reported making a behavior change consistent with that <b>action</b> <b>plan.</b> Conclusions: Most patients reported making a behavior change based on an <b>action</b> <b>plan,</b> suggesting that <b>action</b> <b>plans</b> may be a useful strategy to encourage behavior change for patients seen in primary care.

40|$|In 2004, the European <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for Organic Food and Farming was launched. Many European {{countries}} have also developed national Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> {{to promote and}} support organic agriculture. As part of the EU funded ORGAP project (“European <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> of Organic Food and Farming - Development of criteria and procedures {{for the evaluation of}} the EU <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> for Organic Agriculture”) a toolbox to evaluate and monitor the implementation of national and European <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> has been developed. In order to communicate the results of this project as widely as possible, a practical manual for initiating and evaluating Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> has been produced. This manual has been created to inspire the people, organisations and institutions involved, or with an interest, in the organic food and farming sector to engage in the initiation, review, revision and renewal of regional, national and European Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans.</b> The objectives of the manual are to provide: • a tool for stakeholder involvement in future <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> development and implementation processes at EU, national and regional level • a guide {{to the use of the}} Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> Evaluation Toolbox (ORGAPET) developed through the project The manual summarises the key lessons learnt from more than 10 years experience of development, implementation and evaluation of Organic <b>Action</b> <b>Plans</b> throughout Europe.

2500|$|The model also {{posits that}} visual {{perception}} encodes spatial properties of objects, such as size and location, {{relative to other}} objects in the visual field; in other words, it utilizes relative metrics and scene-based frames of reference.

Thus, grasping movements directed towards objects embedded in size-contrast-ambiguous scenes {{have been shown to}} escape the effects of these illusions, as different frames of references and metrics are involved in the perception of the illusion versus the execution of the grasping act.|$|E

The separation of the planning construct into two constructs, <b>action</b> <b>planning</b> and coping planning, has been found useful as studies have confirmed the discriminant validity of such a distinction. <b>Action</b> <b>planning</b> seems to be more important for the initiation of health behaviors, whereas coping planning is required for the initiation and maintenance of actions as well.|$|E
