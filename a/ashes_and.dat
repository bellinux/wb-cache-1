Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay.

Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site.

30|$|Utilization of fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal}} solid waste {{in the field of}} geotechnical engineering necessitates determination of its physical, chemical, morphological and engineering properties. This paper presents detailed physical, chemical and geotechnical characterization of fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal solid}} waste from Telangana State in India. Fly <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> bottom <b>ash</b> samples were collected from Kakatiya thermal power station in India. Municipal solid waste (MSW) sample was collected from Borabanda municipal dump site in the city of Hyderabad, India. From the experimental results, it is noticed that specific gravity of fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> {{municipal solid waste}} were found to be 1.86, 1.77 and 2.2 respectively. Presence of quartz and mullite; quartz, mullite and calcium carbonate; and quartz and corundum are found to be predominant in fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> MSW respectively. The peak friction angle of fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste were found to be 37.02 °, 33.77 ° and 35.23 ° respectively. Permeability characteristics of fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste were observed to be 1.01 E− 04  cm/s, 2.01 E− 04  cm/s and 1.16 E− 04  cm/s respectively. From the observation of experimental results, it can be concluded that fly <b>ash,</b> bottom <b>ash</b> <b>and</b> municipal solid waste from Telangana state are effective material to be used as backfill material, filter material and embankment construction.|$|R

At that time the Scottish landmass formed part of the Old Red Sandstone Continent and lay some 10-25 degrees south of the equator. The accumulations of Old Red Sandstone, laid down from 408 to 370 million years ago, were created as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then were deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of the eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The structure of Papa Stour is largely made up of <b>ashes</b> <b>and</b> lavas from volcanic activity associated with this period, including bands of solidified volcanic ash and lava (rhyolite), {{but there is also a}} Devonian fish bed at Lamba Banks.

The Prapancasarasara-samgraha relates that she wears a dress taken from a corpse. Dhumavati is the embodiment of tamas guna, associated with ignorance and darkness.

Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, <b>ashes,</b> <b>and</b> flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga.

The Podłęże site was occupied from the mid-3rd century BC on and yielded many metal objects, coins and coin blank molds, large collection of glass bracelets. The Zakrzowiec Celtic graves have the form of large (several metres long) dugout rectangular enclosures containing the <b>ashes</b> <b>and</b> grave offerings, such as pottery and personal ornaments. Graves of the same type but of a later period, 1st to 2nd century AD, are also found around Kraków, which demonstrates continuation of the Celtic tradition even after the arrival of Germanic tribes in the area. The Celtic burial site investigated in Aleksandrowice contains a rich 2nd century BC assemblage of funerary gifts including iron weapons and decorative elements. The unique fancy decorations, including a sheath with a recurring dragon motif, relate the findings only to the Celtic settlement area in Slovenia and western Croatia.|$|E
5|$|In an {{otherwise}} high-scoring series, O'Reilly's greatest triumph {{was in the}} low-scoring Fourth Test at Headingley, where he exploited a difficult pitch to take five wickets in each innings as Australia secured the victory that enabled them to retain the Ashes. With the series level at 0–0, England captain Hammond elected to bat first; O'Reilly's 5/66 was largely responsible for ending England's innings at 223. He removed Hammond, who had top-scored with 76, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton, all bowled in quick succession. England were 1/73 on the third day, an overall lead of 54, when O'Reilly began a new spell after Bradman had switched his ends. Joe Hardstaff junior hooked him for four and the next ball was no-balled by the umpire. O'Reilly {{was reported to have}} become visibly enraged; he bowled Hardstaff next ball and then removed Hammond for a golden duck. This precipitated an English collapse to 123 all out, and O'Reilly ended with 5/56 and a total of 10/122.
