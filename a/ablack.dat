5000|$|Despite the low viewing figures, {{the season}} was still a {{critical}} hit. The influx of new actors and characters was described as being [...] "fresh", a [...] "chance to bring new energy into the show", and [...] "stir up the school right from its very heart", although original cast member Aubrey Graham criticised the producers {{and the way it}} happened. [...] "One day we came in and all the names were just changed on the dressing rooms. Everyone got cut. We go upstairs and it’s like, 'Who are all these people auditioning in the front?' They owe us a lot of money. The amount of loyalty, the years we put in with these people... they did us foul. As far as the producers go, I don’t talk to anybody over there." [...] Writing about specific new actors, Dani Ng-See-Quan of andPop praised Charlotte Arnold for being able to study a full-time journalism course at Ryerson University and to act full-time in a television series at the same time. Ryerson University's on-campus newspaper, The Eyeopener also praised Arnold for this achievement, as well as fellow cast members and students Raymond <b>Ablack,</b> Nina Dobrev and Evan Williams. Calgary Herald and National Post writer Michael Morrison said Paula Brancati [...] "has become my favorite Canadian actress", admiring her ability to play two different characters on two different series - Jane Vaugn on Degrassi: The Next Generation and Jenny on Being Erica - with an age difference of about thirteen years, and in playing Jane, a character who is the victim of child molestation [...] "it is never an easy thing for an actor to portray, but Brancati does it convincingly." [...] This season also promoted awareness in Asperger syndrome; A.J. Saudin's character Connor is a sufferer. Melinda Shankar's portrayal of a first-generation Canadian whose family comes from India was acknowledged, as her character struggles to deal with the culture clash of acting, dressing and dating who she likes, against her conservative parents' wishes. At AfterElton.com, a magazine a website that focuses on the portrayal of bisexual and homosexual men in the media, was critical that the sexuality of new character Riley, played by Argiris Karras, has so far been through the eyes of Peter Stone, Riley's unrequited love interest, and that the storyline served only to advance Peter's character. There was praise, however, that Riley is a departure from previous gay characters Marco Del Rossi, Alex Nuñez, and Dylan and Paige Michalchuck, in that he is confused about his sexuality, and unlike sweet and sensitive Marco, Riley is an alpha male jock who is very much in denial about himself. Jamaican-Canadian screenwriter Annmarie Morais said of the Canadian television industry that Degrassi: The Next Generation {{is a prime example of}} a Canadian television series that has garnered international acclaim while maintaining a strong and realistic portrayal of life in Canada. [...] "While in the States, I work with a lot of teenagers and pre-teens, and every one of them knows about Degrassi. Now, that show doesn't have an O.C. formula or Beverly Hills 90210 formula; it's unique and it has a Canadian voice. Shows like Degrassi prove that we can develop shows that have strength across the border." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We give a 7. 18 -approximation {{algorithm}} for {{the minimum}} latency problem that uses only O(n log n) {{calls to the}} prize-collecting Steiner tree (PCST) subroutine of Goemans and Williamson. This improves the previous best algorithms in both performance guarantee and running time. A previous algorithm of Goemans and Kleinberg for the minimum latency problem requires anapproximation algorithm for the k-MST problem which is called as a black box for each valueof k. Their algorithm can achieve a performance guarantee of 10. 77 while making O(n 2 log n) PCST calls (via a k-MST algorithm of Garg), or a performance guarantee of 7. 18 + ffl while using nO(1 /ffl) PCST calls (via a k-MST algorithm of Arora and Karakostas). In all cases, the runningtime {{is dominated by the}} PCST calls. Since the PCST subroutine can be implemented to run in O(n 2) time, the overall running time of our algorithm is O(n 3 log n). The basic idea for our improvement is that we do not treat the k-MST algorithm as <b>ablack</b> box. This allows us to take advantage of some special situations in which the PCS...|$|E
