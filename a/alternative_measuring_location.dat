This {{is most often}} distance to the center, based on the monocentric model, which does not consider the decentralization of employment in urban areas. This paper tests the perfor-mance of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> of <b>location,</b> considering both distance and time to the center and to multiple employment centers and measures of accessibility to employment and change in accessibility. The measures using multiple employment centers and accessibility perform better than simple distance to the center, with the combination of accessibility to employment and change in accessibility doing best...|$|R
40|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>measures</b> are formalized {{programs}} across Canada {{by which}} offenders {{who would otherwise}} proceed to court are dealt with through non-judicial, community-based alternatives. Typical programs could include com-munity service, personal service or financial compensation to a victim, apologies, or educational sessions. In 1998 - 99, 33, 173 youth cases reached agreement to participate in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> For every 10, 000 youth in Canada, 135 participated in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> Among jurisdictions, Alberta had {{the highest rate of}} youth assigned to <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> (384 per 10, 000 youth). British Columbia (63) and Ontario (66) had the lowest participation rates. Males represented the majority of youth participating in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> Almost two-thirds (63 %) of alter-native measures cases involved males. However, this is lower than the proportion of cases heard in youth courts involving males (79 %). Six out of ten youth assigned to <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> were 15 years of age or older. Aboriginal youth are disproportionately represented in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures.</b> While representing 4 % of the youth population, Aboriginal youth accounted for 15 % of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> cases in jurisdictions that were able to provide data. For {{the second year in a}} row, youth who committed property-related crimes were most often referred to alterna-tive measures. Over one-half (57 %) of all cases in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> were for theft under $ 5, 000. Similar to that found in 1997 - 98, the most frequent types of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> interventions administered to youth in 1998 - 99 were community service (22 %) and apologies (17 %). The majority of youth in <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> successfully completed all measures agreed to (93 %).

40|$|POLICY <b>Alternative</b> <b>measures</b> {{should be}} {{considered}} for any case where the successful completion of an <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> program can achieve the most important objectives of a court prosecution. The Criminal Justice Branch supports the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> programs, and recognizes {{that they can be}} the most appropriate and effective way to address harm done to the community and to allow offenders to be rehabilitated and accept responsibility for their criminal conduct. This specifically includes programs authorized under section 717 of the Criminal Code which are based on restorative justice principles, such as family group conferencing, community accountability panels, aboriginal justice programs and victim/offender reconciliation processes. The Branch also supports other restorative justice programs which do not involve the <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> process. The Branch supports the use of <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> programs which recognize the circumstances of aboriginal offenders. Prior to recommending <b>alternative</b> <b>measures,</b> Crown Counsel must be satisfied that there is a substantial likelihood of conviction. The application of this policy is a continuing one. Notwithstanding an initial determination that <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> are not suitable, upon receipt of new information it may be appropriate to reassess the decision regarding <b>alternative</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

30|$|The maximum air {{velocity}} at <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 4 occurs {{from the center}} to the left bottom corner, and the lowest {{air velocity}} is at the right upper corner. At <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 17, the air velocity decreases from the lower right corner to the upper left corner. The maximum air velocities are observed near the entry floors for <b>measuring</b> <b>locations</b> A 26 and A 27. A sensor location correction factor is determined by comparing the air velocity and the measured average air velocity. The velocity distribution at a plane {{does not affect the}} average velocity significantly, but it does affect the sensor readings. Apparently, a sensor mounted in a high-velocity zone will yield a smaller correction factor than one mounted in a low-velocity zone. Using <b>measuring</b> <b>location</b> A 17 as an example, a larger correction factor will be obtained if the sensor is at the left side than that at the right side, as the air velocity exhibits an increasing trend from left to right.|$|R

The analysis considered the land use around the <b>measuring</b> <b>locations</b> split into three categories (built, green and open) as well as climatic conditions and studied the effect of these on ambient temperature at each <b>measuring</b> <b>location.</b> It was found that, similarly to macro-scale studies at the urban level, <b>measuring</b> <b>locations</b> with a higher green cover have a lower ambient temperature compared with <b>measuring</b> <b>locations</b> with a higher built and/or open land cover.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown an inverse relation between response times in elementary cognitive tasks and intelligence, but findings are inconsistent as to {{which is the most}} informative score. We conducted a study (N = 200) using a battery of elementary cognitive tasks, working memory capacity (WMC) paradigms, and a test of fluid intelligence (gf). Frequently used candidate scores and model parameters derived from the response time (RT) distribution were tested. Results confirmed a clear correlation of mean RT with WMC and to a lesser degree with gf. Highly comparable correlations were obtained for <b>alternative</b> <b>location</b> <b>measures</b> with or without extreme value treatment. Moderate correlations were found as well for scores of RT variability, but they were not as strong as for mean RT. Additionally, there was a trend towards higher correlations for slow RT bands, as compared to faster RT bands. Clearer evidence was obtained in an ex-Gaussian decomposition of the response times: the exponential component was selectively related to WMC and gf in easy tasks, while mean response time was additionally predictive in the most complex tasks. The diffusion model parsimoniously accounted for these effects in terms of individual differences in drift rate. Finally, correlations of model parameters as trait-like dispositions were investigated across different tasks, by correlating parameters of the diffusion and the ex-Gaussian model with conventional RT and accuracy scores...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{illustrate}} {{the importance of the}} REER calculation in making the inference for the price competiveness of the economy. Despite the same essence of the calculations used worldwide, there are still many differences with respect to the treatment of the relative prices, selection of the weighting criterion and its time variation, third markets competition, etc. Hence, all these elements could be country-specific. Within the paper, new <b>alternative</b> <b>measures</b> of REER of the Denar are calculated. First, we calculate new measure by changing the country weights in line with the strong recent changes in the trade directions and the structure of the economy.

Finally, we try to see the effect of different deflators, and for this purpose an <b>alternative</b> <b>measure</b> using ULC as relative price is calculated. The paper presents the differences among the <b>alternative</b> <b>measures,</b> and how they affect the overall assessment of the price competitiveness of the country.
