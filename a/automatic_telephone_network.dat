50|$|Mili {{studied in}} France at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (Saint-Cloud) and the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (Paris), graduating as a {{telecommunications}} engineer in 1946. He joined the Tunisian Posts and Telecommunications (PTT) Administration in 1948. In 1957, {{he was promoted}} to become Chief Engineer and took up his duties as Director-General of Telecommunications at the Ministry of PTT. In that capacity, he modernized the Tunisian <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> by introducing the automatic crossbar-type system.Before joining ITU, Mili had, since 1956, led the Tunisian delegation at many of ITU’s major events, including the Plenipotentiary Conferences of 1959 and 1965, the Plenary Assemblies of the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee (CCITT) of 1958, 1960 and 1964, and the Plenary Assembly of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) in 1963. He was also active in several CCITT study groups, notably those that dealt with telephone switching and signalling and the worldwide <b>automatic</b> and semi-automatic <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> and in CCIR study groups in the areas of space systems and radio astronomy and radio-relay systems.Mili was actively involved {{in the work of the}} World Plan Committee, which was responsible for planning the world telecommunication network. In 1961, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Plan Committee for Africa and became its Chairman in 1964. From 1960 to 1965, Mili represented Tunisia on the ITU Administrative Council and was elected Chairman of its 19th Session in 1964.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Almon Strowger, of Kansas City, Missouri, was {{inspired}} by the idea of manufacturing <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges that would not require switchboard operators. He founded the Strowger <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Exchange Company in 1891, which held the first patents for the <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. Subsequently, in 1901, Strowger helped form the Automatic Electric Company to which he leased his patents exclusively.|$|R

The first maker of automatic exchanges in the UK, this company (as of 1923) {{was one of}} four which manufactured equipment for Post Office-owned central offices. It became part of International <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Co in 1920, which changed name to Automatic Electric Co in 1932 and <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> and Electric Co Ltd in 1936 to reflect a product range which included sidelines ranging from Xcel heating appliances to traffic signals.|$|R

50|$|TXK (Telephone eXchange Crossbar) was a {{range of}} Crossbar exchanges used by the British Post Office <b>telephone</b> <b>network,</b> {{subsequently}} BT, between 1964 and 1994. TXC {{was used as the}} designation at first, but this was later changed as TXC sounded too much like TXE the code used for later electronic exchanges. Prior to this the GPO had standardised on Strowger for automatic switching and had resisted the adoption of Crossbar, preferring to wait for its electronic switching research to bear fruit. The development of electronic systems however took longer than anticipated and the British equipment manufacturers, particularly <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> & Electric (ATE), which later became part of the Plessey group feared that continuing to focus the bulk of their production on Strowger equipment would harm their export sales as Crossbar had already become popular throughout the world.|$|R

In this thesis, we first give an overview of the intelligent network, which includes the review of the motivation, technology, evolution, standards, components and the open issues of the intelligent network. The emphasis of the thesis is put on the intelligent network service creation. Three AIN (Advanced Intelligent Network) services, namely, the call by name, the <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> directory service and the information query service, are designed and implemented in the AIN Service Creation Environment (SCE). An AIN multimedia fax service which is a novel application of the AIN technology is proposed. With a gateway between the <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> and the Internet, we use AIN to provide automatic addressing, dynamic routing and flexible selecting of document type for the multimedia fax service. The idea and the technique used in this AIN multimedia fax service bring up a new AIN service opportunity which allows telephone subscribers to access abundant Internet resources. The performance of this service is evaluated based on the simulation model of priority queuing system...|$|R
