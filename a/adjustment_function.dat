40|$|Precipitation {{measurements}} exhibit large cold-season biases due to under-catch in windy conditions. These uncertainties affect {{water balance}} calculations, snowpack monitoring and calibration of remote sensing algorithms and land surface models. More accurate data {{would improve the}} ability to predict future changes in water resources and mountain hazards in snow-dominated regions. In 2010, a comprehensive test site for precipitation measurements was established on a mountain plateau in southern Norway. Automatic precipitation gauge data are compared with data from a precipitation gauge in a Double Fence Intercomparison Reference (DFIR) wind shield construction which serves as the reference. A large number of other sensors are provided supporting data for relevant meteorological parameters. In this paper, data from three winters are used to study and determine the wind-induced under-catch of solid precipitation. Qualitative analyses and Bayesian statistics are used to evaluate and objectively choose the model that best describes the data. A continuous <b>adjustment</b> <b>function</b> and its uncertainty are derived for measurements {{of all types of}} winter precipitation (from rain to dry snow). A regression analysis does not reveal any significant misspecifications for the <b>adjustment</b> <b>function,</b> but shows that the chosen model does not describe the regression noise optimally. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>function</b> is operationally usable because it is based only on data available at standard automatic weather stations. The results show a non-linear relationship between under-catch and wind speed during winter precipitation events and there is a clear temperature dependency, mainly reflecting the precipitation type. The results allow, for the first time, derivation of an <b>adjustment</b> <b>function</b> based on measurements above 7 m s − 1.

30|$|Generally speaking, {{adjustment}} coefficients {{are regarded}} as the safety indices of the surplus processes, they are the positive zero-roots of the <b>adjustment</b> coefficient <b>functions.</b> In classical unidimensional Lundberg-type risk models, most of which assumed that the surplus processes are Lévy processes, the <b>adjustment</b> coefficient <b>functions</b> are obtained via martingale techniques: the cumulate generating functions (c.g.f.’s) of the net loss processes. However, in our risk models, the whole surplus processes are not Lévy processes anymore. According to Nyrhinen [18] and Müller and Pflug [19], there also exist <b>adjustment</b> coefficient <b>functions</b> for the unidimensional non-Lévy contexts using another approach: let c_n(t) be the c.g.f. of the aggregate net loss process (aggregate claims minus aggregate premia incomes) at time n, the <b>adjustment</b> coefficient <b>function</b> is given by c(t)=_n→∞ 1 /nc_n(t).

40|$|Using a {{panel of}} Uruguayan {{manufacturing}} firms we analyze the adjustment process in capital, blue collar and white collar employment. Our results confirm the lumpy nature of factor adjustment, the relevance of nonlinearities and the interdependence between factor shortages. The average annual estimated output gap due to adjustment cost for 1982 - 1995 was 2 %. Trade openness affected the <b>adjustment</b> <b>functions</b> of all three factors. Highly protected sectors adjust less when creating jobs (reducing labor shortages) than sectors with low protection. This {{may be due to}} fears of policy reversal in highly protected sectors. Also, highly protected sectors adjust more easily (than low protection sectors) when destroying jobs (reducing labor surpluses), {{especially in the case of}} blue collar labor. This suggests that trade protection may in fact destroy rather than create jobs within industries, as firms in highly protected sectors are more reluctant to hire and more ready to fire than firms in sectors with low protection. The results for capital are qualitatively similar but quantitatively smaller. Overall the impact of higher international exposure is larger for blue collar workers than white collar workers. <b>Adjustment</b> costs, <b>Adjustment</b> <b>functions,</b> Openness...|$|R

The proposition was finalized by achieving a model of prognosis present on a site hosted by a Web server. The software solve {{the problem for the}} general case, depending on the input data after analysis. After analyzing input data sets are used with one, two or three components (trend, seasonality and residual variable). According to the input data the adjustment model regarding the description of the analyzed phenomenon (additive and multiplying) is chosen. If the chronogram of the analyzed phenomenon indicates an oscillating evolution, of sinusoidal nature, the additive model (+) is chosen, otherwise the multiplying model () is chosen. The seasonal component is estimated and the deseasonalized chronological series is determined. The seasonality is determined by: the procedure of arithmetical means, the procedure of moving averages and the procedure of analytical tendency. The <b>adjustment</b> <b>function</b> is specified regarding the tendency of the phenomenon and its parameters are estimated.
