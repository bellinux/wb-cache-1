40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{prospects}} of extending flexible automation and intelligent manufacturing options {{in the field of}} textile and clothing industries. In particular the paper focuses on the <b>automatic</b> <b>gripping</b> and handling of limp and soft materials that is a needed step to extend automation beyond the fabric parts cutting by exploiting options of robotics, already in use for most of the manufacturing of automotive electric, electronic and mechanical goods. The manufacturing section here considered in clothes manufacturing is the cutting room and the task is picking up a piece of fabric from the cutting table and forward it single out, flat in a well defied pose to the following manufacturing sections. The robotic system purposely developed is presented: it includes: - a metamorphic robotic gripper to carry out automatically the cut part picking tasks and giving back the part hung; - a reconfigurable passive hanger. The system architecture and main components are presented...|$|E
40|$|Use of robotic {{systems in}} {{industrial}} processes offers huge potential in economic benefits, performance, safety and precision. One {{of the most}} important aspects of robotic manipulation is the gripping process. Grippers range in complexity from the simplest single-actuated 1 -movable part jaws, up to very advanced multi-fingered multi-jointed hand-like grippers. More complex gripping operations require advanced control systems in order to replace the dexterity, intuition and reflexes of human hands. This thesis will explore the possibilities of the SCHUNK Dextrous Hand (SDH), a 3 -fingered gripper with 7 degrees of freedom and tactile feedback sensors in the fingers. By creating a feedback control system, this gripper can be used to grip unknown and fragile objects. Tasks: 1) Do a literature survey in the field of robotic gripping 2) Design a system for <b>automatic</b> <b>gripping</b> and holding objects, that involves both a manipulator arm and the SCHUNK Dextrous Hand. 3) Implement the gripper part of the above mentioned control system that can grip objects of various shapes and sizes and of a fragile nature...|$|E

The multispan bridge employed 250 kg metal columns 2.5 m high and was intended for crossings by T-26 and BT light tanks of water obstacles up to 20 - 50 m wide and 3 m deep. The launching of each bridge section took 20-30 min. The bridge had no development after testing.|$|R
5000|$|While any paintball marker {{may be used}} in woodsball, {{the format}} allows for marker {{customization}} - allowing a player to fill tactical roles while using the same marker throughout. For example, a player might fulfill the role of a sniper by adding a telescopic sight, stock, and more accurate barrel to their marker. The same equipment can be later replaced by fully <b>automatic</b> <b>grips</b> and/or circuit boards, which enable the player to play as a gunner. Because of the range of possibilities, woodsball markers often come out of the box with basic configurations, allowing for later modification. Markers can also include military-simulation (or [...] "Mil-Sim") markers - which appear aesthetically similar to real firearms.|$|R

40|$|Summary. In the {{previous}} paper regarding the somato-sensory {{control of the}} human precision grip, we concluded that the elicited <b>automatic</b> <b>grip</b> force adjustments are graded by the amplitude of the imposed loads when restraining an 'active 7 object subjected to unpredictable pulling forces (Johansson et al. 1992 a). Using the same subjects and apparatus, the present study examines the capacity to respond to imposed load forces applied at various rates. Grip and load forces (forces normal and tangential to the grip surfaces) and {{the position of the}} object in the pulling direction (distal) were recorded. Trapezoidal load force profiles with plateau amplitudes of 2 N were delivered at the following rates of loading and unloading in an unpredictable sequence: 2 N/s, 4 N/s or 8 N/s. In addition, trials with higher load rate (32 N/s) at...|$|R
5000|$|Uncertainty {{surrounds}} which year Beretta began producing {{their first}} [...]25 calibre pocket pistols. Dates suggested by various sources range between 1919 and 1922. Design work {{may have started}} before the First World War, however the company gave precedence to military requirements so work on the compact 6.35 mm only resumed {{at the end of}} the conflict. The first version of the gun was very similar to the Model 1922; nearly a scale model in fact, with the single important difference of a spring-loaded firing pin rather than an internal hammer. Mechanically this change was detrimental; it was probably made due to considerations of size. In every other way the two pistols are identical. They share the trigger mechanism fitted with an escaping disconnector, which is typical of all Beretta pistols of that period. A short time afterward a second version (Model 19) appeared, with an <b>automatic</b> <b>grip</b> safety fitted on the frame backstrap. Presumably the safety was added to make up for the reduced level of safety inherent in guns with a striker-type firing pin.|$|R
40|$|EVOKED {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} in 10 subjects to assess cortical involvement in <b>automatic</b> control of <b>grip</b> force during restraint of a manipulandum held between finger and thumb. Brisk pulling loads elicited an increase in first dorsal interosseous EMG after 60. 6 f 2. 4 ms. Preceding this response were several time-locked scalp potentials, the most significant being a widespread negativity that appeared first over the frontal cortex and peaked 19. 5 A 1. 8 ms before the EMG peak, and a positivity that followed the EMG by 24. 3 + 5. 4 ms. The slope of the negativity and the amplitude of the positivity were greater than during passive conditions, suggesting that these potentials reflect cortical processes associated with automatic regulation.

40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A cable drawn farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move irrigation structure as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine carrier frame and attachment structural requirements. An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An <b>automatic</b> cable <b>gripping</b> device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers. A programmable logical controller (PLC) was selected and a control sequence is provided to accommodate the field operations. This research defined design parameters for a CDFS compatible with linear move irrigation system operations. Analytical results provide support for the concept of multipurpose use of a linear move irrigation system...|$|R
