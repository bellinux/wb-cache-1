50|$|Farmer Research Committees do <b>adaptive</b> <b>research</b> {{experiments}} to help farmers manage {{the risk of}} trying something new that extension has not validated under local conditions. In Latin America, numerous Farmer Research Committees have been particularly effective in evaluating and selecting new varieties and multiplying seed, enabling large numbers of farmers to access a new variety at low cost, improve their food security, generate employment and increase their income. On a lesser scale, Farmer Research Committees have worked on small machinery, fertilisers or pest and disease control regimes, enabling the adoption of cost-effective strategies in which local farmers have confidence. Farmer Research Committees may {{have an important role}} to play in rural communities' adaptation of their agriculture to climate change and globalization because they increase community-level innovative and adaptive capacity by strengthening its human and social capital.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life (A-Life). A-Life research addresses {{a wide range of}} phenomena, some of which have no obvious bearing on AI research. The work most relevant to AI is sufficiently coherent and distinct that it is best referred to by its own name: it is <b>Adaptive</b> Behavior <b>research</b> which is most likely to have significant impact on issues traditionally studied in AI. Some motivations for <b>adaptive</b> behavior <b>research</b> are reviewed, and some of the differences between adaptive behavior and traditional AI are discussed. One significant feature of current <b>adaptive</b> behavior <b>research</b> is a focus on relatively simple and specialised cognitive functions, an approach which invites unfavourable comparisons with the "blocksworld" simplified domains which were popular in AI research of the early 1970 's. However, such comparisons usually overlook fundamental differences between the blocksworld-AI and Adaptive Behavior approaches [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Farmer Research Committees (also {{known in}} Latin America as Comites de Investigacion Agropecuario Local or CIALs [...] ) are an {{approach}} to community organizing and agricultural extension that provides rural communities and farmer organizations in developing countries with an <b>adaptive</b> <b>research</b> and technology testing service run by volunteer farmers. This approach to agricultural innovation is used in international development and rural community development for improving adoption of appropriate technology {{and the development of}} sustainable agriculture. The approach involves collaboration and joint decision-making among extension agents, farmers and researchers to develop locally acceptable farming practices and accelerate their adoption. Farmer Research Committees also produce a broad set of benefits that are generally referred to as empowerment,including the increased self-esteem and effectiveness of farmers to organise and negotiate with extension service and agricultural input providers, market chain actors, banks and politicians.|$|E
50|$|The Director General (DG) is {{the head}} of the organisation. In {{addition}} to the headquarters and central station at Joydebpur, the institute is supported by nine regional stations at Barisal, Bhanga, Satkhira, Kushtia, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Habiganj, Comilla and Sonagazi. There are 19 research divisions to take care of different disciplines: Plant Breeding, Hybrid Rice,Genetic Resources and Seed, Biotechnology, Grain Quality and Nutrition, Agronomy, Soil Science, Irrigation and Water Management, Plant Physiology, Entomology, Plant Pathology, Rice Farming Systems, Agricultural Statistics, Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Farm Machinery and Post Harvest Technology, Workshop Machinery and Maintenance, and <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Research</b> and Training. Research activities are operated under seven programme areas which include varietal development, crop-soil-water management, pest management, rice-based farming systems, farm mechanisation, socioeconomics and policy, and technology transfer. The overall management of the institute is vested on a 13-member Board of Management chaired by the Director General. The DG is assisted by two directors, one is for research and the other for administration and finance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>adaptive</b> theory <b>research</b> {{methodology}} can resolve structure-agency issue related to management research methods. Management phenomena {{are part of}} the social reality that is produced by continuous, circular process whereby individual behaviour (agency) creates social structure that in turn shapes individual behaviour. Quantitative research overemphasises structure whereas highly qualitative research overly focuses on individual subjectivity or agency. It is argued that {{in order to have a}} holistic understanding, both structure and agency aspects of a phenomenon need to be studied in a single research project. The paper explains the philosophical underpinnings of adaptive theory and then illustrates using experience of a recently concluded <b>adaptive</b> theory-based <b>research,</b> useful guidelines for application of this research methodology...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Agricultural Research (DAR) in Malawi {{has made}} a modest {{contribution}} to small farmers in supplying them with recommendations they can adopt. This was {{largely due to the}} biological emphasis of the department. In order to introduce social scientists and following in recognition of the poor adoption of recommended technology, Farming System Research (FSR) was introduced in 1979. That has now changed to <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Research.</b> This also followed a major reorganization of the department into Commodity and <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Research</b> Teams. Biological scientists rely on analysis of variance in evaluating alternative technologies and while it is useful in determining the significant differences among treatment means, it is not sufficient for making recommendations to farmers. Building on statistical analysis, economic analysis evaluates alternatives in terms of their profitability attractiveness. Economic models that can be used are discussed and simple benefit cost and marginal benefit cost analyses have been demonstrated in this paper. The results indicate the necessity of economic analysis in making recommendations to farmers and how guidance to policy makers can be had from sensitivity analysis. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
40|$|This study, {{designed}} to investigate trade-offs between forage yields, feed quality and labour use in fitting a newly introduced crop, Lablab purpureus, into an existing farming system, adopted distinct applied and <b>adaptive</b> <b>research</b> approaches. The applied research component compared forage yields, nutrient contents and feeding qualities of L. purpureus harvested at 100, 114, 128 or 142 d after planting in an on-farm trial. The <b>adaptive</b> <b>research</b> investigated how farmers incorporated L. purpureus cultivation into their farming calendars given {{the constraints of}} labour for planting and harvesting. Harvested dry matter yields from the on-farm experiment were 1. 28, 1. 98, 1. 74 and 1. 44 t ha- 1. The resultant hays were fed to four groups each of five Bunaji lactating cows in an on-farm feeding trial over a 10 -week period. Ranking the various harvests for yield, the hays for feed value, animal responses to the feed consumed {{and the quality of}} animal products on a linear scale (1 to 4) to estimate a composite utility index, showed that harvesting at 114 d after planting gave the most desirable overall benefits. The survey for <b>adaptive</b> <b>research</b> showed bimodal rainfed and irrigated cultivation patterns for L. purpureus. Peaks were observed in September (31 percent of farmers) and November (24 percent) for planting, and in December (39. 4 percent) and March (15 percent) for harvesting. Forage yields were, however, highest for the 3 percent of farmers who afforded labour to plant in July and harvest in October. The lack of congruence between highest forage yield periods and the peaks of cultivation of L. purpureus by farmers in the study area was mostly explained by very significant differences in the cost of hired and household labour in different months. Thus, socio-economic and cultural factors, including stakeholders; participation, need to be considered along with applied research results when recommending forage species for farmers' adoption...|$|E

On the basis of this information trials are now being carried out at the Rural Training Centre, Mfonta and on farmers fields. Good results against leaf-eating caterpillars, aphids and bugs have been obtained using sprays made from the following plants: Jim son weed (Datura stramonium), castor oil (Ricinus communis), God's tobacco (Lobelia columnaris) and papaya (Carica papaya). The scientists involved feel that the work of farmers as researchers on their own fields is of great importance and should be intensified, but so also should that of research institutions. Both approaches should proceed hand-in-hand.
