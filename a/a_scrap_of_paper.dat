500|$|In {{the series}} finale [...] "The Truth", Skinner seeks Covarrubias {{as a witness}} in Mulder's trial for murder. After Skinner fails to track her down, the ghost of X hands Mulder <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with her new address on it. She is called upon to testify, and speaks about her {{involvement}} with the Syndicate to some extent. However, when pressed for further information about {{the continuation of the}} conspiracy she clams up, and at Mulder's request is dismissed from the stand for fear that if she divulges certain knowledge, she would be killed.|$|E
500|$|That year, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred {{to as the}} [...] "drop-T" [...] logo) {{made its}} debut. Epstein and Starr visited Drum City, one of Ivor Arbiter's stores in Shaftesbury Avenue, to {{purchase}} a new drum kit. Epstein asked for the band name {{to appear on the}} bass drum. Arbiter designed a logo with an extended [...] "T" [...] emphasising the word [...] "Beat". Drum City was paid £5 for the design, which Arbiter sketched on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to be painted on the drum by a local sign-writer.|$|E

500|$|In 1900, Ina Coolbrith, Bohemian Club librarian, edited a {{collection}} of O'Connell's poetry, entitled Songs from Bohemia, copyrighted to Mabel Ashley O'Connell. Coolbrith ended the book with [...] "The Chamber of Sleep", the last poem by O'Connell, written ten days before his death. William Greer Harrison wrote in a memorial foreword that O'Connell was an avid outdoorsman of eternally sunny disposition. He mentioned his appreciation for good food and his fine chef's skill in delicate cookery. Harrison wrote of his flair for swordsmanship and his pleasure in fishing, and noted that during any of these activities, O'Connell could be seen pausing to write down on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> {{an idea for a}} story.|$|E
500|$|Pei took to {{the project}} with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had {{recently}} recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land {{at the intersection of}} Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: [...] "No compromises." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{occasionally}} admonished {{and advised}} the groupies and prostitutes sent to pleasure his siblings. One Jackson fan recalled being {{selected from the}} audience to meet with Jackie. Backstage, she was handed <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with {{an address to the}} location in which they were to meet. Michael approached her from behind and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex. Changing the subject, the female fan asked for the pop star's autograph, which request he obliged in addition to writing, [...] "Please, don't go". The woman ignored Michael's request and headed to the Jacksons' apartment complex, where she had sex with Jackie. Afterward, Jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again. Ashamed and upset, the fan left the apartment in tears.|$|E
60|$|Merlin chuckled, {{and gazed}} {{for a moment}} {{ironically}} at Juliette. He had held, between his talon-like fingers, that very morning, <b>a</b> thin <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> on which <b>a</b> schoolgirlish hand had scrawled the denunciation against Citizen-Deputy Déroulède.|$|R
5000|$|The son {{was troubled}} by the {{prospect}} because he had thought he could now be comfortable, but in the end, he obeyed. <b>A</b> tiny <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> floated by when he had sunk the money; it contained six shillings.|$|R

500|$|In 1939, Stalin {{approved}} {{the publication of}} one volume of poetry, From Six Books; however, the collection was withdrawn and pulped {{after only a few}} months. In 1993, it was revealed that the authorities had bugged her flat and kept her under constant surveillance, keeping detailed files on her from this time, accruing some 900 pages of [...] "denunciations, reports of phone taps, quotations from writings, confessions of those close to her". Although officially stifled, Akhmatova's work continued to circulate in secret. Akhmatova's close friend, chronicler Lydia Chukovskaya described how writers working to keep poetic messages alive used various strategies. A small trusted circle would, for example, memorise each other's works and circulate them only by oral means. She tells how Akhmatova would write out her poem for a visitor on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> to be read in a moment, then burnt in her stove. The poems were carefully disseminated in this way, however it is likely that many compiled in this manner were lost. [...] "It was like a ritual," [...] Chukovskaya wrote. [...] "Hands, matches, an ashtray. A ritual beautiful and bitter." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the group}} {{attempts}} to enter Dr. Totenkopf's lair, one scientist is electrocuted {{by the defense}} system. A hologram of Totenkopf appears, speaking about his hate for humanity and his plans to rebuild it as a new master race. Dex disables the defenses and the group discovers Totenkopf's mummified corpse inside with <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> clutched in his hand: [...] "forgive me". He had died 20 years prior, but his machines continued his plan. Joe decides to sabotage the rocket from the inside while the others escape. Polly tries to tag along, but Joe kisses her and then knocks her out. Polly recovers, following Joe and luckily saving him from Dr. Jennings' assassin, a female robot. Joe and Polly then board the rocket. Before the rocket reaches 100km, when its second stage is scheduled to fire and thereby incinerate the Earth, Polly pushes an emergency button that ejects all the animals in escape pods. Joe tries to disable the rocket only to be interrupted by the same robot. He jolts the robot with its electric weapon and then uses it on the controls, disabling the rocket. They use the last pod to save themselves as the rocket safely explodes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first name}} of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock {{preferred}} to focus the audience's attention on {{the solution to the}} mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film.) The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Crane is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about [...] "Mother" [...] without tipping that something was being hidden. As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.|$|E
6000|$|... "You ought," [...] Payne {{answered}} meaningly, {{and walking}} {{to the other end}} of the veranda stuck <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> white <b>paper</b> on <b>a</b> post. [...] "Say, suppose you try her? I want to see you put a pill through that." ...|$|R
6000|$|Morrison surrendered, {{himself to}} another season of cogitation, {{in which he}} {{probably}} found his vagueness growing upon him. He ended by fumbling in all his pockets, and bringing up from the last <b>a</b> crumpled <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> [...] "What you--what you say that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] said Augusta, [...] "but I will inquire." [...] Accordingly {{she went}} and asked Bill and Johnnie: {{but neither of}} them had a pencil or <b>a</b> single <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> and she {{returned}} sadly to communicate the news.|$|R
500|$|Tintin is {{informed}} by Thomson and Thompson of a case involving the ramblings of a drunken man, later killed, found with <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> from {{what appears to be}} a tin of crab meat with the word [...] "Karaboudjan" [...] scrawled on it. His subsequent investigation and the kidnapping of a Japanese man interested in giving him a letter leads Tintin to a ship called the Karaboudjan, where he is abducted by a syndicate of criminals who have hidden opium in the crab tins. Tintin escapes from his locked room after Snowy chews through his bonds and Tintin knocks out a man sent to bring him food, leaving the man bound and gagged in the room. Tintin encounters Captain Haddock, an alcoholic sea captain, who is manipulated by his first mate, Allan, and is unaware of his crew's criminal activities. Tintin hides in the locker under the bed and defeats Jumbo, the sailor left in the cabin, while Allan thinks Tintin has climbed out of the porthole back into the storeroom. He blows open the storeroom door, then finding it empty goes back to the Captain's room, where he finds Jumbo tied to a chair and gagged. Escaping the ship in a lifeboat after sending a radio message to the police about the cargo, a seaplane tries to attack them. Tintin and the Captain hijack the plane, tie up the pilots, and try to reach Spain. Haddock's drunken behaviour in a storm causes them to crash-land in the Sahara, where the crew escapes.|$|E

2500|$|He had the soldier's hat, {{the worn}} knapsack, the dented canteen. But when Darius Cobb {{set out in}} the 1870s to make a still-life {{lithograph}} of Civil War artifacts, he was missing one important element - a tin cup. So, tacked onto the wall in the trompe-l'œil rendering is <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with a sketched outline and the words [...] "Dipper Missing". [...] "Each painting has a story like this," [...] said Susan Abele, curator of [...] "Rediscovering Newton Artists, 1850-1950", at the Newton History Museum at the Jackson Homestead.|$|E
60|$|The {{agreement}} was drawn up hastily on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> uncleanly <b>paper</b> with Sewell's fountain pen, {{but he made}} it hard and fast, while Hetty flitted busily between the shed and the shanty. Then Sewell carefully wiped and put away his pen.|$|R
60|$|Gregory knew that, at Wad Gamr's house, but few {{signs of}} the tragedy had been found when General Brackenbury's troops entered.

2500|$|The Tamam Shud case, {{also known}} as the Mystery of the Somerton Man, is an unsolved case of an {{unidentified}} man found dead at 6:30am, 1 December 1948, on Somerton beach, Glenelg, just south of Adelaide, South Australia. It is named after the Persian phrase tamám shud, meaning [...] "ended" [...] or [...] "finished", printed on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> found months later in the fob pocket of the man's trousers. The scrap had been torn from the final page of a copy of Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, authored by 12th-century poet Omar Khayyám.Tamam was misspelt as Taman in many early reports and this error has often been repeated.|$|E
2500|$|The Maze {{was painted}} in gouache colors. Kurelek {{describes}} it as [...] "a painting of {{the inside of my}} skull." [...] That skull has been split open vertically to reveal various compartments inside. Through the eyes, nose, and mouth we can see {{the rest of the body}} lying in a wheat field. Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run through the maze of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible.|$|E
2500|$|Back in the U.S., Mike {{maintains}} a low profile. He tells a cab driver to drive past {{the house where}} all his friends are waiting, as he is embarrassed by the fuss Linda and the others have made. He visits Linda the following day and grows close to her, but {{only because of the}} friend they both think they have lost. Mike goes to visit Angela at Steven's mother's home. Angela is barely responsive. When asked by Mike about Steven's whereabouts, she writes a phone number on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> which leads Mike to the local VA hospital where Steven has been for several months. Mike goes hunting with Axel, John, and Stan one more time, and after tracking a deer across the woods, but fires into the air. He then sits on a rock escarpment and yells out, [...] "OK?", which echoes back at him. He also berates Stan for carrying around a small revolver and waving it around, not realizing it is loaded. Mike visits Steven, who has lost both of his legs and is partially paralyzed. Steven reveals that someone in Saigon has been mailing large amounts of money to him, and Mike is convinced that it is Nick. Mike brings a reluctant Steven home to Angela and then travels to Saigon just before its fall in 1975.|$|E
6000|$|... 2 October, evening--A {{long and}} trying and {{exciting}} day.

5000|$|Fotzel slices: Nobody {{really knows}} how this dish got its name. Literally, [...] "fotzel" [...] means <b>a</b> torn-off <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> but in Basel dialect it means a {{suspicious}} individual.

2500|$|Fully recuperated and optimistic, he {{returned}} home to The Mount, Shrewsbury. He discussed his ideas {{with his father and}} asked for advice about Emma. Speaking from experience, Doctor Robert Waring Darwin told his son to conceal religious doubts which could cause [...] "extreme misery... Things went on pretty well until the husband or wife became out of health, and then some women suffered miserably by doubting about the salvation of their husbands, thus making them likewise to suffer." [...] Charles drew up a list with two columns on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> Under Marry he listed benefits, [...] "Children–if it please God–Constant companion & friend in old age will feel interested in one,–object to be beloved and played with, better than a dog anyhow", while under Not Marry he put [...] "Freedom to go where one liked... Not forced to visit relatives... to have the expense and anxiety of children... fatness & idleness... if many children forced to earn one's bread...". He jotted down further thoughts, then concluded [...] "My God, it is intolerable to think of spending ones whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, & nothing after all. – No, no won't do. – Imagine living all one's day solitarily in smoky dirty London House. – Only picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music perhaps – Compare this vision with the dingy reality of Grt.

2500|$|As McKittrick was {{led from}} the court, Bennett asked her to give {{evidence}} against Paulus, but she was initially reluctant to do so. She continued to resist until the case against Paulus was heard in February 1975. At the trial, McKittrick testified that Robinson had paid Paulus $25,000 {{to find someone to}} eliminate Hill, and that in turn, Paulus had paid Vandiver $5,000 to carry out the murder. McKittrick and Robinson both passed polygraph tests. The results indicated that McKittrick was being truthful when she stated that Robinson had caused John Hill's death and that Robinson was telling the truth when he said {{he had nothing to do}} with Hill's murder. Bennett also produced evidence that Ash Robinson had taken out a private telephone number, which had been found written on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> in Paulus's handbag. DeGuerin then sought to portray McKittrick as a liar by calling Paulus to the witness stand, a strategy that was almost successful until Paulus deviated from the agreed testimony. She had sought to portray herself as a respectable widow who had taken pity on McKittrick. However, after telling the court that she did not know Vandiver, but had taken McKittrick into her home after a friend of her late husband had introduced them in the spring of 1972, Paulus offered comment on the difference between the two women's lifestyles. She told the court [...] "I liked [...] even though you could gather from her conversation that her life was just a little bit different from mine".|$|E
