5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions.

Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests <b>are</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
