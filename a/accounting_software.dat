5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{first entered}} into the {{electronic}} accounting market with the acquisition of a Boston-based <b>accounting</b> <b>software</b> developer in 1960. The software division was doing well in the 1970s, but its products were out-of-date by the 1980s. At the time, data could not be shared between departments and only one user was allowed on the system at a time. Each computer came {{at a cost of}} more than $100,000. Even as the computer division grew, the company's overall business revenue declined due to paper business forms becoming obsolete. In 1986, the company acquired Arnold Corporation, which increased Reynolds' revenues 50 percent and expanded its market presence to other industries besides car dealerships. The head of the computers division, David Holmes, was appointed CEO in 1989. He led the company's first large-scale lay-off in the printing division, cutting headcount and manufacturing space in half. The employees resisted the changes he incorporated. According to Forbes, this move was necessary and led to increases in profit and revenues.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{critical}} thinking skills among the students of <b>accounting</b> and <b>software</b> in the female technical and vocational university in the city of Borojerd. This study is a descriptive-comparative research. The statistical population of this study includes the female students of <b>accounting</b> and <b>software</b> in the technical and vocational university in the city of Borojerd. A sample of 60 students was selected from this population randomly in the 2014. The sample consists of 30 students of <b>accounting</b> and 30 <b>software</b> students. In order to collect the research data, the second form of California Critical Thinking Skills Questionnaire was used. The research data were analyzed in the SPSS 16 through analysis of variance (ANOVA). The average and standard deviation of the research data is 9. 15 ± 3. 09. Although the scores of accounting students were better than the scores of software students, but no significant difference was not observed between them. The difference between the two groups of respondents was significant in terms of inductive reasoning (p = 0. 014). Another part of our findings revealed that the scores of critical thinking skills among the <b>accounting</b> and <b>software</b> students are similar to the scores of critical thinking skills of students in other countries. Our findings revealed that the scores of critical thinking skills of <b>accounting</b> and <b>software</b> students are lower than the scores of those in other countries.
