5|$|The house {{also has}} {{significant}} interior features, including marble fireplaces, wood paneling, coffered ceilings, window and door <b>architraves,</b> parquet floors, and extensive carved wood and plaster detail, {{primarily in the}} Adamesque mold. The original furnishings together were reported in 1895 to have cost {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars, and to have included rare tapestries, carved woods, paintings, and Italian marble.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the kitchen garden {{were built in the}} 1920s and include two {{gateways}} with neoclassical <b>architraves.</b> The gravel paths are laid out in a square with a cross at the centre enhanced by a fountain surrounded by fruit trees, vegetable plots and soft fruits. There are carriage openings with wrought-iron gates.|$|E

50|$|Seankhibtawy Seankhibra was {{an enigmatic}} Ancient Egyptian {{king of the}} 12th Dynasty, around 1950 BC. Seankhibtawy Seankhibra is so far only known from an <b>architrave</b> found at Ayn Shams (the ancient Iunu or Heliopolis). The <b>architrave</b> adorned once a private tomb.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>architrave</b> ( [...] ; from <b>architrave</b> [...] "chief beam", {{also called}} an epistyle; from Greek ἐπίστυλον epistylon [...] "door frame") is the lintel or beam that {{rests on the}} capitals of the columns. It is an {{architectural}} element in Classical architecture.|$|R
5|$|East Worldham House, a Grade II listed building, {{dates to}} the late 18th and early 19th century. The two-storey house is made with ashlar walls, flat arches and stone cills. The {{entrance}} {{is located on the}} west side and features a Tuscan porch in the centre, with 5 windows, one of them large. The interior of the house contains Regency features, with a staircase, panelled doors in <b>architraves,</b> and several fireplaces. The coach house, 5 metres {{to the north of the}} house is also a listed building, dated to the early 19th century. It is made of malmstone ashlar, with the upper wall of the centre boarded with a hay loft door and has a hipped slate roof. Today this building functions as a garage and workshop.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, they tended to be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and <b>architraves</b> that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E

25|$|The {{two columns}} {{that support the}} entablatures and {{coat-of-arms}} above the bust are of black polished marble. The two putti and the skull are of sandstone, and the capitals and bases of the columns are of gilded sandstone. The <b>architraves,</b> frieze and cornice were originally of red-veined white alabaster, but they were replaced in 1749 with white marble. The effigy and the cushion are carved of one piece of bluish Cotswold limestone, and the inlaid panels are of black touchstone.|$|E
25|$|Concrete quickly supplanted brick as {{the primary}} {{building}} material, and more daring buildings soon followed, with great pillars supporting broad arches and domes rather than dense lines of columns suspending flat <b>architraves.</b> The freedom of concrete also inspired the colonnade screen, a row of purely decorative columns {{in front of a}} load-bearing wall. In smaller-scale architecture, concrete's strength freed the floor plan from rectangular cells to a more free-flowing environment. Most of these developments are described by Vitruvius, writing in the first century AD in his work De Architectura.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} three apses are of magnificent construction. Each {{contains two}} registers of columns {{separated by a}} decorative firese and surmounted by <b>architraves.</b> Between the columns there lie the niches. The horizontal cross-section of the niches in each register alternate between rectangular and circular. The semidome of each is decorated with beautiful design. Above the registers lies the majestic semidome. There paintings than can be distinguished in these semidomes. The one in the central apse has a painting of the Pantokrator and the four evangelists. In the northern apse, there is a depiction of the dormition of the Virgin Mary. The southern apse has {{a representation of the}} resurrection with the two Mary's and two angels.|$|E

25|$|At {{the rear}} of the {{property}} there are two central bays which break forward with 12-pane sashes to ground floor, 9-pane to first and 6-pane sashes to second floor, side-bays have 8-pane margin sashes to ground and first floors. The interior features of the property that are highlighted by English Heritage include the central entrance hall with an oval open-well staircase (which has a continuous handrail and cast-iron balusters). Also noted are the presence of period doors, of six-panelled design, in panelled reveals and moulded <b>architraves,</b> and the existence of period window shutters. On the ground floor, the drawing room has a scrolled plaster ceiling margin and a fireplace, which are singled out for special mention.|$|E
25|$|The Hôtel Alexandre or Hôtel Soult, rue de la Ville l'Évêque, Paris (1763–1766), is {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of Boullée's residential work in Paris. It was built for the financier André-Claude-Nicolas Alexandre. In its cour d'honneur four Corinthian columns embedded against a recess in the wall plane create an entry (now glazed). Flanking doors {{in the corners of}} the courtyard have isolated <b>architraves</b> embedded in the wall above their plain openings, while above oval bull's-eye windows are draped with the swags of husks that became a common feature of the neoclassical manner. The garden front has a colossal order of pilasters raised on the high basement occupied by the full height of the ground floor.|$|E
25|$|Many Coptic monasteries {{and churches}} {{scattered}} throughout Egypt are built of mudbrick on the basilica plan inherited from Graeco-Roman architectural styles. They usually have heavy walls and columns, <b>architraves</b> and barrel-vaulted roofs, and {{end in a}} tripartite apse, but many variant plans exist. Domes are small compared to Byzantine churches, and from the 10th-century naves are often roofed with domed cupolas. The dome raised on a circular supporting wall, which is so characteristic of later Byzantine architecture, is rarely used. Massive timber is often used across the nave, sometimes to support a flat roof, and sometimes to give structural strength to the walls. Inside the churches are richly decorated with frescoed murals and reliefs.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is reached by three limestone steps. The <b>architrave</b> {{of the entrance}} loggia is topped by a fruit-and-swag draped escutcheon. Smooth, variegated marble double-columns, topped by composite capitals, stand above the <b>architrave.</b> The entrance originally featured French doors, but were replaced by black enameled doors decorative by bas-relief wreaths.|$|R

25|$|Charles Barry {{introduced}} the Neo-Renaissance to England with his {{design of the}} Travellers Club, Pall Mall (1829-1832). Other early but typical, domestic examples of the Neo-Renaissance include Mentmore Towers and the Château de Ferrières, both designed in the 1850s by Joseph Paxton {{for members of the}} Rothschild banking family. The style is characterized by original Renaissance motifs, taken from such Quattrocento architects as Alberti. These motifs included rusticated masonry and quoins, windows framed by <b>architraves</b> and doors crowned by pediments and entablatures. If a building were of several floors the uppermost floor usually had small square windows representing the minor mezzanine floor of the original Renaissance designs. However, the Neo-renaissance style later came to incorporate Romanesque and Baroque features not found in the original Renaissance architecture which was often more severe in its design.|$|E
25|$|Only {{three basic}} colors were used: white, blue and red, {{occasionally}} also black. The crepidoma, columns and architrave were mostly white. Only details, like the horizontally cut grooves {{at the bottom}} of Doric capitals (anuli), or decorative elements of Doric <b>architraves</b> (e.g. taenia and guttae) might be painted in different colours. The frieze was clearly structured by use of colours. In a Doric triglyph frieze, blue triglyphs alternated with red metopes, the latter often serving as a background for individually painted sculptures. Reliefs, ornaments and pedimental sculptures were executed with a wider variety of colours and nuances. Recessed or otherwise shaded elements, like mutules or triglyph slits could be painted black. Paint was mostly applied to parts that were not load-bearing, whereas structural parts like columns or the horizontal elements of architrave and geison were left unpainted (if made of high quality limestone or marble) or covered with a white stucco.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} {{on the south side}} of Castle Square are all of a similar age but show a great variety of sizes and styles. The Royal Pavilion Tavern is one of the taller buildings at four storeys in height. The slate-tiled gambrel roof has dormer windows and is partly hidden behind a balustrade which sits on top of a parapet and cornice. The façade is stuccoed and projects as a segmental-arched bow front. The stucco is rusticated at ground-floor level. The entrance is in the rightmost of the three bays and is flanked by granite pilasters topped by brackets with foliage decoration. Above this, an iron balcony runs across the full width of the building at first-floor level; this dates from the late 19th century and has finials in the form of interlinked dolphins and crowns, recalling the Borough of Brighton's emblem. Each storey has three windows, but they are treated in various ways; those at first-floor level have <b>architraves,</b> the second-storey windows have a small individual iron balcony with anthemion decoration; and those on the top floor have prominent sills.|$|E
5000|$|Concrete {{stairs in}} the southern, front {{elevation}} {{lead to the}} ground floor verandah which, like the first floor balcony, extends from the southern elevation around and along the eastern elevation. The front, main entrance is a panelled timber door with moulded <b>architrave.</b> The words [...] "GREEN HOUSE" [...] appear on the <b>architrave.</b>|$|R
50|$|Khabaw is however well attested through archaeological finds. Fragments {{of a red}} granite <b>architrave</b> {{measuring}} 2 ft by 5 ft bearing his Horus {{name and}} prenomen were discovered during excavations at Bubastis in 1891 conducted by Édouard Naville for the Egypt Exploration Society. The <b>architrave</b> {{is now in the}} British Museum, under the catalog number BM EA 1100. Another <b>architrave</b> discovered in Tanis shows Khabaw's name together with that of pharaoh Hor of the 13th Dynasty. Darrell Baker and Ryholt suggest that this close association might mean that Khabaw was Hor's son and may have been his coregent.|$|R
50|$|It is an {{impressive}} building with a late-Gothic lattice-worked <b>architrave</b> running along the building. This elegant <b>architrave</b> resembles somewhat the <b>architrave</b> of the Monastery of Batalha, {{even if there are}} some early-Manueline influences. Above the entrance porch on the western façade one can see the ajimez window (a mullioned window in Manueline and Moorish style) in the room of the abbess, originating from the demolished palace of the dukes of Beja. The entrance door is embedded under an ogee arch. A square bell-tower and a spire with crockets tower above the complex. The convent has been classified as a national monument.|$|R
25|$|In any case, the {{majority}} of templa followed the same basic design. They were usually carved of monochrome marble, though some, like Hagia Sophia’s, were covered in precious metals and others used polychrome marbles. The slabs were often carved with vegetal or animal patterns and the <b>architraves</b> with busts of God, the Virgin, and the saints. Figurative decoration on the templon was mainly concentrated on the architrave, initially with carved busts. This continued {{from the time of}} Justinian into the middle Byzantine period, as shown from a 10th-century excavation in Sebaste in Phrygia, which uncovered a marble templon whose epistyle is covered with busts of saints. There is evidence that icons were hung from the columns of the templon prior to iconoclasm. Nicephorus I, Patriarch of Constantinople from 806 to 815 describes portable icons hung from columns and the gate of the templon in his Antirretikoi. Important portable and colossal icons were also placed in front of the templon, as in the 11th-century church of Saint Panteleimon in Nerzei.|$|E
25|$|At {{the site}} of the church, prior to its construction, there was a three-nave early Christian basilica. There are {{references}} to its creation as a monastery church, which Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen already pursued in 1900. Due to frequent rebuilding activities, however, no archaeological evidence remains of the monastery. Walls and other elements of the preexisting buildings were used in the church, among others the four strong pillars which carry the central dome, as well as part of the eastern wall, left and right of the apse. The current dividing wall between the nave and the narthex was in fact the original western wall of the basilica. The entrance to the nave, with marble doorposts, was the entrance of the original building. The larger entrance on the northern side was probably reused as spolia. Various parts of the building show evidence of the use of spolia from ancient Thera, a city on the Mesa Vouno, a foothill of the Profitis Ilias. Among these are the Doric pillars with capitals and bases, a number of <b>architraves,</b> round altars and carved bull heads.|$|E
25|$|The Clarence Moore House is {{a classic}} example of the Beaux Arts {{architectural}} style and features a Louis XV-style exterior. The -story structure includes a basement and comprises brick walls, a concrete floor, and a steel roof. The building measures 79.5 feet (24.2m) in height and the walls are made of Roman brick. A limestone Tuscan entablature with a bracket cornice separate the third and fourth floors. The building's north entrance on Massachusetts Avenue has a 6x6foot (1.8x1.8m) stoop flanked by limestone balustrades. Above the entrance and ground floor windows are limestone corbels and guttae. The corbels support limestone second floor balconies and a vase balustrade. The third floor balconies are made of limestone and feature cast iron railings. The second, third, and fourth floor window and <b>architraves</b> are set in a quoined limestone ground. Six limestone chimneys, capped with Tusance entablature, are visible from the ground level. Two chimneys are located at the front and back of the house and a chimney is located on the eastern and western sides. The slate mansard roof has a limestone and metal ridge.|$|E
