500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{wrote that}} {{although}} he had stayed away from McLachlan's music in the past, [...] "between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and 'Building a Mystery' bonanza, [...] had to dive in, and got less than [...] bargained for." [...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you want <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nirvana, {{you have to go}} along at her protracted, glacial pace." [...] They said that McLachlan is too [...] "rigid in her introspection" [...] and {{that they would like to}} hear her [...] "work up a good head of steam".|$|E
500|$|Since the {{publication}} of Cullen's and Farson's books, other Ripper authors have argued that their theories are based solely on flawed circumstantial evidence, and have attempted to provide Druitt with alibis for the times of the murders. On 1 September, {{the day after the}} murder of Nichols, Druitt was in Dorset playing cricket. On the day of Chapman's murder, he played cricket in Blackheath, and the day after the murders of Stride and Eddowes, he was in the West Country defending a client in a court case. While writers Andrew Spallek and Tom Cullen argue that Druitt had the time and opportunity to travel by train between London and his cricket and legal engagements, or use his city chambers as a base from which to commit the murders, others dismiss that as [...] "improbable". Many experts believe that the killer was local to Whitechapel, whereas Druitt lived miles away {{on the other side of}} the River Thames. His chambers were within walking distance of Whitechapel, and his regular rail journey would almost certainly have brought him to Cannon Street station, a few minutes' walk from the East End. It seems unlikely, however, that he could have travelled the distance in blood-stained clothes unnoticed, and a clue discovered during the investigation into the murder of Catherine Eddowes (<b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blood-stained clothing) indicates that the murderer travelled north-east from where she was murdered, whereas Druitt's chambers, and the railway station, were to the south-west.|$|E

500|$|... "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] {{has been}} covered by {{numerous}} artists. One {{of the first}} cover recordings was an acoustic piano version by Tori Amos on her 1992 Crucify EP, which Cobain referred to as [...] "a great breakfast cereal version". The jazz trio The Bad Plus recorded the track for its CD These Are the Vistas, the Melvins recorded a version on The Crybaby featuring former child star Leif Garrett, and the industrial act Xorcist also released a tribute on the various artists compilation album [...] The Moog Cookbook put out a synthesizer-based cover version on The Moog Cookbook and the Japanese Beatboxer Dokaka has recorded a beatboxed cover version. British group The Flying Pickets released an a cappella version of the song on their album [...] Covers of the song on tribute albums include Blanks 77 on Smells Like Bleach: A Punk Tribute to Nirvana, and Beki Bondage on Smells Like Nirvana; both released in 2000. In 2005, [...] "Teen Spirit" [...] was covered as a swing song by 1950s star Paul Anka. In 2006, the band Flyleaf covered the song for Yahoo!'s LAUNCHcast service. In 2007, Patti Smith included a cover version, which incorporated <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poetry, on her album of cover songs Twelve. This was a particularly lyrical and melodic version of the song. Robert Glasper covered the song for his album with The Experiment band, featuring Lalah Hathaway, for the album Black Radio, which received the award for Best R Album at the 55th Grammy Awards. It has been regularly added to the repertoire of young jazz students and musicians in an imitative style of his arrangement. In 2015 a choral version of the song appeared in the documentary Montage of Heck, performed by Scala & Kolacny Brothers, playing over previously unseen footage from the [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] video shoot.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{motorcade}} {{turned the corner}} onto Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, the First Lady heard what she {{thought to be a}} motorcycle backfiring and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard Governor Connally scream. Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and one of the shots struck her husband in the head. Almost immediately, she began to climb onto the back of the limousine; Secret Service agent Clint Hill later told the Warren Commission that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's skull that had been blown off. Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat. As Hill stood on the back bumper, Associated Press photographer Ike Altgens snapped a photograph that was featured on the front pages of newspapers around the world. She would later testify that she saw pictures [...] "of me climbing out the back. But I don't remember that at all".|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Emin was commissioned, {{as part of}} {{a scheme}} {{throughout}} London titled Art in Sacred Spaces, to collaborate with children on an artwork at Ecclesbourne Primary School in Islington, north London. Pupils made the piece with her in Emin's style of sewing cut out letters onto a large piece of material. In 2004 the school enquired if Emin would sign the work so that the school could sell it as an original to raise funds. They planned to auction the piece for £35,000 for an arts unit, as it could not afford to display the large work. Emin and her gallery White Cube refused saying that it was not <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> art, therefore reducing its value, and requested it be returned. But Emin quickly came to an agreement with the school, where she paid £4,000 to create a perspex display box for the patchwork quilt to be showcased. Taking as her theme the title [...] "Tell me something beautiful", Emin invited eight-year-olds to nominate their ideas of beauty and then to sew the keywords in felt letters on bright fabric squares. The resulting bold patchwork featured words such as [...] "tree", [...] "sunrise", [...] "dolphin" [...] and [...] "nan".|$|E
