5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree the launching of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> late.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E

25|$|The Last Day of the Twelfth Moon; on {{this holiday}} ale and fruit were {{provided}} as offerings to {{the god of}} the stove, after having Buddhist or Taoist priests recite scripture at one's own home (if one had the wealth and means). Offerings were made to the stove god because it was his responsibility to make annual reports to heaven on the good deeds or sins committed by the family in question. A family would do everything to charm the god, including hanging a newly painted portrait of the god {{on a piece of paper}} above their stove on New Years, which hung in the same position for an entire year. It was a common practice to rub in some alcoholic beverage across the picture of the deities mouth, so that he would become drunk <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> inebriated to make any sort of reasonably bad or negative report about the family to heaven.|$|E
25|$|On 6 May, a major Russian {{offensive}} toward Anatolia developed. The Ottoman defensivee lines {{consisted of}} the X and XI Corps and the 5th Expeditionary Force at the north flank located beyond the province of Van. The north flank of the Russian advance, from Tortum valley toward Erzurum, {{was not part of}} the operations in Van. However, as part of this Russian offensive, the Ottoman 1st Expeditionary Force and the Van Cavalry Brigade were pushed back from their initial positions by Russian soldiers and Armenian voluenteers advancing toward the city of Van. On 12 May, the town of Ardjish at the north of province of Van was relieved. Djevdet sent one cannon and two hundred men from the city of Van to face this group at the Bargiri (Muradiye). However, it was a late move <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> weak to stop this advance. On 6 May, the conflicts around the citadel of Van (in the Kale District) were over.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish–American War {{began on}} April 25, 1898, and ended on August 12, 1898. Cuban and Spanish dead vastly outnumbered American deaths. While 2,910 American {{military}} personnel {{died during the}} war, just 345 were combat deaths. The rest died of disease. The U.S. military barred women from serving in any capacity prior to the war. Although the Army had 791 nurses, they were all male, <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> few to provide the medical care needed. Soldiers resisted being transferred from combat units into the nursing corps, and few volunteers signed up for medical duty. Congress quickly authorized the military to hire female nurses—but on contract, not as military personnel. The army reached out specifically to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), a patriotic society, to recruit women nurses. Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee, one of the medical doctors practicing in the United States, was asked to lead the DAR's recruitment effort. Of the 1,563 nurses recruited for the new Nurse Corps, most served in hospitals in the United States. Only 76 were sent to Cuba, 30 to the Philippines, nine to Puerto Rico, six to Honolulu, and eight served aboard the hospital ship USS Relief. It {{was the first time}} in American history where nurses were fully accepted in military hospitals.|$|E

500|$|Pluto's {{size was}} finally {{determined}} conclusively in 1978, when American astronomer James W. Christy discovered its moon Charon. This enabled him, together with Robert Sutton Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory, {{to measure the}} mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon's orbital motion around Pluto. They determined Pluto's mass to be 1.31×1022kg; roughly one five-hundredth that of Earth or one-sixth that of the Moon, <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets.

500|$|Despite limited British activity, a few {{operations}} {{combined with}} the effort of local forces led to [...] "a drastic weakening" [...] of Hassan's forces by 1918. Thus, after the armistice ending the First World War, the government sent Major General Arthur Hoskins {{to take control of}} the forces in Somaliland and defeat Hassan conclusively in battle. After Hoskins arrived, his initial plan for dealing with Hassan focussed on the use of the newly formed Royal Air Force, so Ismay and the Camel Corps were consigned to a minor role. Hoskins's plans, however, were found [...] "overscaled <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> costly", so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919.|$|E

She disliked Kurt's angry, [...] "overwrought" [...] {{reaction to his}} friends' prayers and the [...] "silly" [...] grilled cheese sandwich subplot, however wished there had been more focus on the [...] "rich, barely tapped vein" [...] of the Sue subplot. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon criticized the episode's lack of subtlety, feeling that {{in its attempt to}} be controversial, Glee became a clichéd after school special. Fallon had been excited to see religion and homosexuality tackled on Glee, but was disappointed that the end result was [...] "completely devoid of humor", with dialogue [...] "so stilted, wooden, and earnest that the treatment of the subject was largely ineffective <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> easy to make fun of."

500|$|Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger [...] "throws himself completely" [...] {{into the}} role, {{and that the}} film {{represents}} Nolan's [...] "most accomplished and mature" [...] work, and the most technically impressive and resonant of all the Batman films. Levy calls the action sequences {{some of the most}} impressive seen in an American film for years, and talks of the Hong Kong-set portion of the film as being particularly visually impressive. Levy and Peter Travers conclude that the film is [...] "haunting and visionary," [...] while Levy {{goes on to say that}} The Dark Knight is [...] "nothing short of brilliant." [...] On the other hand, David Denby of The New Yorker said that the story is not coherent enough to properly flesh out the disparities. He said the film's mood is one of [...] "constant climax," [...] and that it feels rushed <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> long. Denby criticized scenes which he argued to be meaningless or are cut short just as they become interesting. Denby remarks that the central conflict is workable, but that [...] "only half the team can act it," [...] saying that Bale's [...] "placid" [...] Bruce Wayne and [...] "dogged but uninteresting" [...] Batman is constantly upstaged by Ledger's [...] "sinister and frightening" [...] performance, which he says is the film's one element of success. Denby concludes that Ledger is [...] "mesmerising" [...] in every scene. The vocalization of Christian Bale's Batman (which was partly altered during post-production) was the subject of particular criticism by some commentators, with David Edelstein from NPR describing Bale delivering his performance with [...] "a voice that's deeper and hammier than ever". Alonso Duralde at MSNBC, however, referred to Bale's voice in The Dark Knight as an [...] "eerie rasp", as opposed to the voice used in the Batman Begins, which according to Duralde [...] "sounded absurdly deep, like a 10-year-old putting on an ‘adult’ voice to make prank phone calls".|$|E
