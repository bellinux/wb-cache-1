5|$|He left Third Mate Gregory Cousins {{in charge}} of the {{navigation}} bridge and <b>Able</b> <b>Seaman</b> Robert Kagan at the helm with instructions from the third mate to return to the southbound traffic lane in the TSS at a prearranged point. Exxon Valdez failed to return to the shipping lanes and struck Bligh Reef at around 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989. The accident resulted in the discharge of around 11 million gallons of oil, 20% of the cargo, into Prince William Sound.|$|E
5|$|Discovery left Isle of Wight on 6 August 1901, {{and arrived}} in New Zealand via Cape Town on 29 November after a detour below 40°S for a {{magnetic}} survey. Quail Island in Lyttelton Harbour {{was used as}} the quarantine station for the expedition's dogs. After three weeks of final preparation she was ready for the journey south. On 21 December, as the ship was leaving Lyttelton to the cheers of large crowds, a young <b>able</b> <b>seaman,</b> Charles Bonner, fell to his death {{from the top of the}} mainmast, which he had climbed so as to return the crowd's applause. He was buried at Port Chalmers, two days later.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, <b>Able</b> <b>Seaman</b> Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as <b>able</b> <b>seaman</b> but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{came from}} a humble {{seafaring}} background and began his naval career as a boy seaman in 1891. His Antarctic experiences began 10 years later, when he joined Scott's Discovery Expedition as an <b>Able</b> <b>Seaman.</b> In 1907 Shackleton recruited Joyce {{to take charge of}} dogs and sledges on the Nimrod Expedition. Subsequently Joyce was engaged in a similar capacity for Douglas Mawson's Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911, but left the expedition before it departed for the Antarctic. In 1914 Shackleton recruited Joyce for the Ross Sea party; despite his heroics this expedition marked the end of Joyce's association with the Antarctic, and of his exploring career, although he made repeated attempts to join other expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an <b>able</b> <b>seaman</b> and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, <b>Able</b> <b>Seaman</b> George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an interim measure, 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A. Hill, until infantry could arrive from Berrima, which was still steaming towards Kabakaul from Karavia Bay. Meanwhile, Bowen pushed on and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in the treetops. By 09:30the situation had become grave, and the Australians suffered their first casualty of the war, with <b>Able</b> <b>Seaman</b> Billy Williams mortally wounded. Also among the casualties was the medical officer, Captain Brian Pockley, who died of his wounds in the afternoon after being evacuated to Berrima.|$|E

50|$|Gockel {{was born}} in Rönsahl, {{a small town in}} North Rhine-Westphalia. After {{completing}} his schooling in Bochum, he began an apprenticeship as a machinist. He soon left the apprenticeship to qualify as an <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman,</b> with which he traveled the world (1963-1969). It was during this time that he began his interest in archaeology.|$|R
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or <b>able</b> <b>seaman,</b> and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E

50|$|Both the Captain and the Mate {{stated that}} they thought it likely the fire {{was caused by the}} {{friction}} of the cargo moving against the ship. The Captain stated that jute goods were considered a risky cargo as oil was used in their manufacture and made them liable for combustion. Friction on bales of goods had been discovered during the voyage and canvas had been worked in between the bales and the hold to restrict this and to prevent further damage to the bales. However, when F. Woods, <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman,</b> was deposed he stated that he saw the captain and <b>Able</b> Bodied <b>Seaman</b> Black go down to the hold with a naked candle on the morning of March 16. Soon after the captain raised the alarm of fire and Woods saw that Black was holding a candlestick but with no candle. Woods asked where the candle was and asserted the captain said to say nothing but that he (the Captain) had dropped it between the bales.|$|R
5000|$|... 29 Able Bodied Seamen, who had {{completed}} additional training and usually had seniority over other crew members. They {{carried out the}} day-to-day operations of the ship. In addition, they were trained to operate the lifeboat davits and man the lifeboats themselves. Each <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman</b> was assigned to a lifeboat and take charge of that boat if no officer were present. About eight of these men were lost when they went below decks to open the E Deck gangway and were never seen again. As almost all the remaining <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman</b> had departed in the first lifeboats launched, the lifeboats launched subsequently had a shortage of trained seamen to man them. As a result, a few stokers and even victualling stewards (some of whom had no experience with lifeboats) were ordered to man the launching and rowing of the boats. In one instance, a passenger with yachting experience (Arthur Godfrey Peuchen) was put in co-command of a lifeboat.|$|R
25|$|Born {{the son of}} Provo Featherstone Wallis, a {{clerk at}} the Royal Navy's Halifax Naval Yard, and Elizabeth Wallis (née Lawlor), Wallis benefited from his father's desire to secure a naval career for his son: knowing the rules for officers' entry into the navy, his father managed to get him officially {{registered}} in May 1795 as an <b>able</b> <b>seaman</b> on the 36-gun frigate HMS Oiseau {{at the age of}} four, by convincing her captain, Robert Murray to list him on the ship's books as an <b>able</b> <b>seaman.</b>|$|E

50|$|Unsatisfied by office work, in {{the summer}} of 1898 Bisset became indentured as an {{ordinary}} seaman through William Thomas & Co., Ltd. of Liverpool for a four-year apprenticeship. He soon set sail from Liverpool on the barque County of Pembroke for a ten-month voyage. Bisset gained additional practical experience in navigation and seamanship during a subsequent voyage of two years and seven weeks aboard the County of Pembroke. In late 1902, a third voyage aboard the County of Pembroke, completed Bisset's four-year apprenticeship and he earned a posting as <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman</b> and eventually third mate.|$|R
2500|$|Butterworth was {{a former}} French vessel, built in 1778, that came into British hands in 1784. In British hands she became a whaler. Her master was Captain William Brown, [...] "an <b>able</b> and expert <b>seaman,</b> {{regularly}} {{brought up in the}} whale fishery." [...] Brown and Butterworth were Greenland whalers. Brown was highly respected in his field and was consulted by a Fellow of the Royal Society concerning the possibility of approaching the North Pole.|$|R

25|$|Head {{money for}} Aquilla, Cantabria and Vigilante was paid in August 1828. First-class shares were worth ₤77 18s 3d (Aquilla), ₤163 18s 5¾d (Cantabria), and ₤61 18s 6d (Vigilante); fifth-class shares, {{the shares of}} an <b>able</b> <b>seaman,</b> were worth 4s 8d, 9s 10½d and 4s 0½d.|$|E
50|$|By 1828, Bunker held 1600 acres (648 hectares), {{of which}} 340 (138 hectares) were cleared.

Once described by Governor Macquarie as 'a very <b>able</b> and expert <b>Seaman...</b> and of a Most respectable Character', he had been a leading member of the community in New South Wales. He has been called the 'father of Australian whaling'.|$|R
60|$|Carter {{cleared his}} throat and began to talk in his slow drawl. He seemed to dole out facts, to {{disclose}} with sparing words the features of the coast, but every word showed the minuteness of his observation, the clear vision of a <b>seaman</b> <b>able</b> to master quickly the aspect of a strange land and of a strange sea. He presented, with concise lucidity, the picture of the tangle of reefs and sandbanks, through which the yacht had miraculously blundered in the dark before she took the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Whip {{line and}} block: The whip {{consists}} of two whip reels mounted on the beach cart, the whip line, and the whip block. Once the shot is fired across the wreck or wreck pole, the shore-side end of the shot line {{is tied to the}} tail block. At that point it is hoped that there is an <b>able</b> bodied <b>seaman</b> aboard the ship capable of hauling in the shot line and attaching the tail block high aboard the ship. Once it is determined that the line has been secured to the vessel, the whip will be used to haul items such as the hawser, breeches buoy and sometimes the life-cart {{back and forth between the}} beach and the wreck. This operates in the same manner as an old-fashioned clothes line with pulleys operates with the surfmen pulling on either the windward or leeward half of the whip from shore.|$|R
