5|$|Throughout Cape Verde, Hurricane Fred {{displaced}} {{more than}} 50families and caused CVE$250million ($2.5million) in damage, {{mostly to the}} agricultural <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> of the Barlavento region. It was the first hurricane {{to move through the}} islands with documented impacts, as well as the nation's only record of onshore hurricane-force winds. Although there were no casualties on land, two fishermen navigating through the storm never returned to port in Boa Vista and were presumed dead. Despite the losses in crops and livestock, rainfall from Fred had a generally positive effect on the larger-scale agriculture of the islands, refilling many rivers and dams and irrigating drought-stricken farmland across the Sotavento region.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks {{have been built}} along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between the public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors,</b> with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{operations}} and discusses {{the effectiveness of}} public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> provision of solid waste collection in Kampala, Uganda. Household {{data suggest that the}} <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> is more effective than the public <b>sector.</b> <b>Private</b> <b>sector</b> companies provide services like container provision and providing timely and fixed collection time tables. Contrary to popular perception, fees charged by private companies are moderate. Public sector clients are charged fees even when the service is supposed to be free. Clients of <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> providers are more satisfied than those of public sector providers. It is however, revealed that while public sector serve mainly the low incomes, the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> serves mainly the rich. In spite of these notable differences, clients of both public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> perceive the problem of solid waste management (SWM) in Kampala to be very serious. The effectiveness of public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> operations in solid waste collection in Kampala is hampered by corruption and lack of transparency. Given the situation of open competition for clients involving both public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> in Kampala, it is possible the public sector can operate effectively if they start commercial services officially like their <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> counterparts. This calls for a formal public-private partnership where the public <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> can work together with the public sector dominating poor and marginalized areas while the <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> concentrates on rich neighborhoods...|$|R
