Comparing with the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> system of thermodynamic expansion valve, this paper studied two kinds of <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> system on the freezing time, overall energy consumption and uniformity temperature distribute.

40|$|CONTEXT: Central {{diabetes}} insipidus (CDI) {{is a rare}} cause of hypernatremia during the neonatal period. The diagnosis is particularly difficult in very low birth weight (VLBW) newborns. CASE REPORT: We report on a preterm newborn who presented CDI soon after birth. On {{the third day of}} life, signs of dehydration were present despite normal <b>fluid</b> <b>supply.</b> The diuresis rate was 4. 4 ml/kg/h. Although the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> was then increased, the dehydration continued, with hypernatremia, normal glycemia, diuresis of 7. 4 ml/kg/h and urine density of 1005 mOsmol/l. Thus, a diagnostic hypothesis of {{diabetes insipidus}} was raised. A test with a nasal vasopressin analogue (dDAVP) was performed and CDI was confirmed. Reduction of the <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> became possible through appropriate treatment. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of CDI is rarely made during the neonatal period, especially in VLBW newborns, because of the difficulty in detecting elevated diuresis. Persistent hypernatremia, usually accompanied by hyperthermia despite abundant <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> weight loss and low urine osmolality are important signs of alert...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{explored}} {{the effect of}} supplying coolant from the inner side of a grinding wheel on the residual stress caused by grinding. Effect of depth of cut on grinding temperature and residual stress was also studied. Results clarified that grinding with an internal coolant supply induced a larger compressive residual stress compared to a conventional external grinding <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> when depth of cut was large. In addition, grinding temperature in the internal grinding <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> was lower than in the external grinding <b>fluid</b> <b>supply,</b> as measured by infrared thermograph camera.

40|$|Keywords-dry turning; flood turning; minimum {{quantity}} lubrication (MQL); Pareto ANOVA analysis; Taguchi methods Abstract—This paper {{presents the}} experimental and analytical results of different cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategies—dry, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) and flood turning {{in terms of}} the surface finish of turned parts. Subsequently, the influence of independent input parameters on surface finish is investigated in order to optimize their effects. Three techniques—traditional analysis, Pareto ANOVA analysis, and the Taguchi method—are employed. Initially mild steel AISI 1030 has been selected as the work material. The results indicate that the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategy has insignificant influence on the surface finish of turned parts. However, the amount of cutting fluid in MQL showed some influence. Further research on two additional materials, aluminum 6061 and alloy steel AISI 4340, reveals that the surface roughness for different work materials is influenced differently by the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategies and there is a scope for optimizing the cutting <b>fluid</b> <b>supply</b> strategy in terms of both method and the amount of cutting fluid. This will reduce the amount of cutting fluids used and consequently, their negative impact on the environment, by avoiding unnecessary applications...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of heat {{transfers}} in counterflow plate {{heat exchanger}} due to presence of an intermediate <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is investigated. The intermediate auxiliary channel is supported by transverse conducting pins. The momentum and energy equations for the primary fluids are solved numerically and validated against a derived approximate analytical solution. A parametric study including {{the effect of the}} various {{plate heat exchanger}}, and auxiliary channel dimensionless parameters is conducted. Different enhancement performance indicators are computed. The various trends of parameters that can better enhance heat transfer rates above those for the conventional plate heat exchanger are identified. Large enhancement factors are obtained under fully developed flow conditions. The maximum enhancement factors can be increased by above 8. 0 - and 5. 0 -fold for the step and exponential distributions of the pins, respectively. Finally, counterflow plate heat exchangers with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>fluid</b> flows are recommended over the typical ones if these flows can be provided with the least cost...|$|R
