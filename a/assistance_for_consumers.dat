40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to create an}} ergonomically sound recycling/trash container, with the {{ultimate}} hope of making the recycling process easier and more intuitive, thereby increasing recycling rates. Currently, while there are many recycling/trash containers available for purchase, there is no product that has a design without glaring ergonomic flaws. An ergonomic design and product prototype was created as a part of this project, and was subsequently tested against a conventional prototype model. The data collected from the experiments conducted suggests that the new ergonomic model makes the waste disposal process and the container transportation process easier, while two-thirds of participants said that they {{would be more likely to}} recycle if they were to own the ergonomic model over the generic. Combined with economic analysis showing the need for a family of four to increase recycling rates by a mere 3 % over the course of a year for the economy to see a full payback on the $ 50 purchase price, government <b>assistance</b> is recommended <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> looking to acquire this product...|$|R

40|$|We are {{reaching}} a crisis with design of user interfaces <b>for</b> <b>consumer</b> electronics.

We propose instead to orient interfaces around the goals that users have for the use of devices. We present Roadie, a user interface agent that provides intelligent context-sensitive help and <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> a network of consumer devices. Roadie uses a Commonsense knowledge base to map between user goals and functions of the devices, and an AI partialorder planner to provide mixed-initiative assistance with executing multi-step procedures and debugging help when things go wrong...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Context and motivation] Safety {{critical}} software systems pervade almost {{every facet of}} our lives. We rely on them for safe air and automative travel, healthcare diagnosis and treatment, power generation and distribution, factory robotics, and advanced <b>assistance</b> systems <b>for</b> special-needs <b>consumers.</b> [Question/Problem] Delivering demonstrably safe systems is di cult, so certification and regulatory agencies routinely require full life-cycle traceability to assist in evaluating them. In practice, however, the traceability links provided by software producers are often incomplete, inaccurate, and ine↵ective for demonstrating software safety. Also, there has been insu cient integration of formal method artifacts into such traceability. [Principal ideas/results] To address these weaknesses we propose a family of reusable traceability queries that serve as a blueprint for traceability in safety critical systems. In particular we present queries that consider formal artifacts, designed to help demonstrate that: 1) identified hazards are addressed in the safetyrelated requirements, and 2) the safety-related requirements are realized in the implemented system. We model these traceability queries using the Visual Trace Modeling Language, which {{has been shown to}} be more intuitive than the defacto SQL standard. [Contribution] Practitioners building safety critical systems can use these trace queries to make their traceability e↵orts more complete, accurate and e↵ective. This, in turn, can assist in building safer software systems and in demonstrating their adequate handling of hazards...|$|R

40|$|With the {{globalization}} of trade, people have become enlightened and demanding consumers as regards the origin of their food and {{the environment in which}} it is produced. The concept of geotraceability described in this article responds to that requirement by combining geographical information with conventional traceability data. The inclusion of geographical information relating to the environment of the production plots is based not only on exploiting some functionalities of spatial analysis tools that exist in geographical information systems (GIS) but also on developing specific tools such as a geoidentifier and geoindicators. This article also describes the characteristics and methods of implementing a geographical information management system linked with traceability information. Lastly, the potential for using geotraceability systems in supply chains is analyzed, in particular <b>for</b> <b>consumer</b> warnings in cases of food crisis and <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> certification of differentiated quality agricultural products...|$|R

40|$|Searching for and {{selecting}} {{complex products}} on the World-Wide-Web is a difficult task <b>for</b> <b>consumers</b> {{as well as for}} business professionals. The main reason for this well-known deficit in e-commerce is that, unlike normal business situations, there is no intelligent support or <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> the user on the Web. This is particularly evident in the selection of products/services or when navigating through the complex space of available product information. Current product-oriented database search facilities are widely used on the Internet but offer limited sales support. In this paper we describe the WEBSELL project (7 / 1998 - 1 / 2000) that set out to develop the next generation of intelligent sales support technology. WEBSELL draws on techniques from case-based reasoning, decision tree based protocol systems, user profiling and collaborative recommendation to produce virtual sales assistants that elicit users’ requirements and identify products or services to meet these requirements...|$|R
