5|$|Via a live news report, a {{high-speed}} car chase {{comes to an}} end in the Nevada desert. Assuming it to be a kidnapping, police pull the female passenger from the car and place her into the protective custody of a police vehicle. The driver, Patrick Crump (Bryan Cranston), is pushed to the asphalt and handcuffed. The woman in the police car begins violently banging her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> window. As the news chopper catches all of this on film, the woman's head explodes, sending a spray of blood across the window.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} 28th, Kevin Harvick {{had advanced}} to the tenth position by lap 28. Two laps later, Greg Biffle said on his team radio that he could smell smoke in his race car, which his team responded that {{it was probably a}} tire rubbing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> During lap 34, Martin Truex, Jr. moved to seventh, having started 25th on the grid. Four laps later, Hamlin had moved to the 22nd position after his earlier accident. On the 41st lap, Truex, Jr. moved past Johnson to claim the fourth position, while Hamlin continued to move toward the front runners. Edwards had over a one-second lead over the second position by lap 46. On the following lap, Hamlin took over the 18th position. After 50 laps, only 38 cars remained on the same lap as the leader. Edwards continued to expand his lead from 1.33 to 1.6 seconds in only five laps. On lap 54, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Allmendinger, Kahne, Truex, and Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} protest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at the Argentine Grand Prix, {{objecting to}} {{the flexibility of}} the fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E

50|$|The first {{form of the}} {{air brake}} {{consisted}} of an air pump, a main reservoir (pressure vessel), and an engineer's valve on the locomotive, and of a train pipe and brake cylinder on each car. One problem with this first form of the air brake was that braking was applied to <b>the</b> first <b>cars</b> in a train much sooner than to <b>the</b> rear <b>cars,</b> resulting in shocks and damages when <b>the</b> rear <b>cars</b> bunted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> ahead of them.|$|R

25|$|On 22 March 2001, {{tensions}} soared {{further in}} Tetovo, when two Albanian men, {{a father and}} a son, were shot dead during a routine search at a police checkpoint. The incident began when the car was stopped and a police officer saw the younger Albanian move something in his pocket. Fearing it was a grenade the officer panicked and ran. The Albanian exited the car, dropped to his knees, and threw the grenade {{in the direction of the}} running policeman. It landed at his feet but failed to explode. At the moment the grenade was thrown, a cordon of Macedonian troops, positioned behind sandbags, unleashed a volley of gunfire at the Albanian. At first he slumped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> then fell on the curb, dead. Moments later the father was also shot as he tried to run from the car. Witnesses later interviewed insisted the father and son died with mobile phones in their hands, claiming that the pair were victims of revenge by police.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Cog {{appeared}} on television, Wieden+Kennedy {{received a letter}} from Peter Fischli and David Weiss, creators of the 1987 art film Der Lauf der Dinge. The film was well known in the advertising industry, and its creators had been approached several times with offers for the right to use the concept, but had always declined. The letter pointed out several similarities between their work and [...] "Cog", and warned the agency that they were considering legal action {{on the basis of the}} [...] "commercialisation and simplification of the film's content and the false impression that [...] might have endorsed the use". When interviewed by Creative Review magazine, the pair made clear that they wished they had been consulted on the advertisement, and that they would not have given permission if asked. Media publications quickly picked up the story, and asserted that Fischli and Weiss were already in the process of litigation <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> manufacturer.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} twin springs on {{each side}} were replaced by a single spring and damper, acting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> body instead of the rear subframe. The brakes were moved to the outboard ends of the driveshafts to enable better heat dissipation and easier servicing. The net result was a reduction in overall weight, but the unsprung weight increased due to the relocation of the brakes more than offsetting the weight reductions on springs and dampers, and the NVH isolation deteriorated slightly.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the train}} started up and had {{scarcely}} gotten under way when with jerk and bump it stopped once more. The conflict grew fiercer as the Indians became more desperate. But evidently they were kept from closing in, for during {{the thick of}} the heaviest volleying the engine again began to puff and the wheels to grind. Slowly the train moved on. Like hail the bullets pattered <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Smoke drifted away on the wind.|$|E
60|$|Alas, for my {{piece of}} mind! On my way homeward, at Reno, I {{encountered}} a simoon of most appalling power.

6000|$|Enquiring {{for her at}} tea time Soames {{learned that}} Fleur had {{been out in the}} car since two. Three hours! Where had she gone? Up to London without a word to him? He had never become quite {{reconciled}} with cars. He had embraced them in principle--like the born empiricist, or Forsyte, that he was--adopting each symptom of progress as it came along with: [...] "Well, we couldn't do without them now." [...] But in fact he found them tearing, great, smelly things. Obliged by Annette to have one--a Rollhard with pearl-grey cushions, electric light, little mirrors, trays for the ashes of cigarettes, flower vases--all smelling of petrol and stephanotis--he regarded it much as he used to regard his brother-in-law, Montague Dartie. The thing typified all that was fast, insecure, and subcutaneously oily in modern life. As modern life became faster, looser, younger, Soames was becoming older, slower, tighter, more and more in thought and language like his father James before him. He was almost aware of it himself. Pace and progress pleased him less and less; there was an ostentation, too, about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing mood of Labour. On one occasion that fellow Sims had driven over the only vested interest of a working man. Soames had not forgotten the behaviour of its master, when not many people would have stopped to put up with it. He had been sorry for the dog, and quite prepared to take its part <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> if that ruffian hadn't been so outrageous. With four hours fast becoming five, and still no Fleur, all the old car-wise feelings he had experienced in person and by proxy balled within him, and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his stomach. At seven he telephoned to Winifred by trunk call. No! Fleur had not been to Green Street. Then where was she? Visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty frills, all blood and dust-stained, in some hideous catastrophe, began to haunt him. He went to her room and spied among her things. She had taken nothing--no dressing-case, no Jewellery. And this, a relief in one sense, increased his fears of an accident. Terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing, especially when he couldn't bear fuss or publicity of any kind! What should he do if she were not back by nightfall? ...|$|E
