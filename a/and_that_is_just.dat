25|$|Though not {{linked to}} flying saucers or odd aerial lights, {{it is perhaps}} worth noting {{that there is a}} long history of claims of contact with non-earthly intelligences. The {{founding}} revelations of many of the world's religions involve contact between the founder and a supernatural source of wisdom, such as a god in human form or an angel. In this context, it might be expected that most of the 1950s contactees would form their own religions, with the contactee as sole spiritual leader, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what happened, almost invariably.|$|E

2500|$|To the students’ surprise, the {{government}} {{released a statement}} on February 13 [...] announcing {{that it would not}} allow the students to enter Yangon <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it would take measures to restore stability if the students did not halt their march. The students immediately held a meeting that evening to decide whether they should continue. The day before on February 12, the students sent a delegate to meet with Aung San Su Kyi who then told the students <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> impossible to achieve all their demands <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the nature of democracy.|$|R

2500|$|The decade also {{contained}} great individual achievements as well. On April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves hit his 715th career home run, surpassing Babe Ruth's all-time record. He would retire in 1976 with 755 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one of numerous records he achieved, many of which, including Total bases scored, still stand today. There was great pitching too: between 1973 and 1975, Nolan Ryan threw 4 [...] "no-hit" [...] games. He would add a record-breaking fifth in 1981 {{and two more}} before his retirement in 1993, by which time he had also accumulated 5,714 strikeouts, another record, in a 27-year career.|$|R

500|$|In {{regards to}} lyrics, Allmusic said the album [...] "boasts some of Hot Chip's most kinetic music, with rhythms <b>and</b> melodies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> as hyper-articulate {{as the word}} play."

2500|$|In {{response}} to the RSF appeal, {{at the end of}} the two-day summit Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal condemned the kidnapping, adding that he hoped the kidnappers would soon release Johnston, saying <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> [...] "certainly ... not something that anybody, anybody would approve of" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Johnston <b>was</b> <b>just</b> [...] "doing his job".|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, Linehan {{discussed}} the dramatic effect this choice {{had on the}} tone of the series: [...] "'Woman of the World' was kind of like a jaunty, plinky-plonky song, <b>and</b> we wanted <b>that</b> song. He [...] gave us two choices: he gave us <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "Songs of Love", and we wanted the plinky-plonky song because our idea was we were making fun of sitcoms. We were saying, you know, we don't like sitcoms. This is a parody of sitcoms. This is a kind of satire on sitcoms. And I remember Geoffrey [...] looking really glum and sad about this, you know? And then he said, 'Why do you want to make fun of your characters?' He said, 'People will love these characters.' <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a real revelation for me, <b>and</b> after <b>that,</b> whatever he said went, as far as I was concerned." ...|$|R
500|$|Since I Left You was {{originally}} developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, [...] "an international search for love {{from country to}} country. The idea of a guy following a girl {{around the world and}} always being one port behind. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> because we had all these records from all over the world, and we'd like to use all that stuff." [...] The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album's sound was in response to dance music at that time, <b>that</b> Chater felt <b>was</b> [...] "about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers [...] "Block Rockin' Beats", with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded". The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to <b>that</b> sound <b>and</b> desired a recording with less bass <b>that</b> <b>was</b> influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "Now you are {{insulting}} me! <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the point.

6000|$|... "Yes, father, but {{you often}} {{use it in}} the evening, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the time when one wants to go out.

Besides, your gondola is a very solid one, and I like passing people." ...|$|E
60|$|Thump! Thump! Thump! There it was again. Peter knew by {{the sound}} that it was of no use to stay and fight, {{especially}} when he was so sore and stiff.

3000|$|Anne: “When I’m have {{having trouble}} with [content] it’s like ‘It’s {{probably}} because I'm stupid and don't understand.’ But then [talking with other students helps me realize] ‘OK, everyone else is struggling with the same concept.’ Or, ‘Someone else has the same question.’ So I think it probably helps with more dense concepts <b>and</b> subjects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> complicated. It kinda helps students relate to other students as well.” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Developers updated their {{engine to}} allow for 150 units {{to be on the}} {{battlefield}} at one time. The game is powered by an upgraded version of Pandemic Studios' Zero engine, and was developed by the same team that worked on the first two [...] installments. Conquest director Eric Gewirtz said the team was [...] "throwing around these ideas, and in perfect serendipity, happened to get access to the Lord of the Rings license, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the center for us on making this game." [...] Howard Shore's music, composed for the film trilogy, was used in the game. The film actors reprise their roles in cutscenes, which are archived footage from the film. In-game likenesses are based on their film counterparts. Hugo Weaving reprises his role as Elrond and serves as the game's narrator. All other cast members were replaced by voice doubles. Chris Edgerly voices Aragorn, Crispin Freeman voices Legolas, Martin Jarvis voices the white wizard Gandalf, and Yuri Lowenthal stands in for Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins.|$|R
