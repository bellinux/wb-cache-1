25|$|Depending on {{the color}} of the roasted beans <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> the human eye, they will be labeled as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more {{accurate}} method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.|$|E

25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of heavy fuel oil and medium speed diesels.|$|E
25|$|The term {{effectively}} {{underscores the}} strong conviction of the New England gentry {{that they were}} a people set apart by destiny to guide the American experiment as their ancestors had played a leading role in founding it. The term also illustrates the erudite and exclusive nature of the New England gentry <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> outsiders, and may also refer to their interest in Eastern religions, fostered perhaps by the impact in the 19th century of the transcendentalist writings of New England literary icons such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman, and the enlightened appeal of Universalist Unitarian movements of the same period.|$|E
30|$|Objective quality {{assessment}} metrics predict visual quality employing mathematical methods instead of human subjects. For instance, mean squared deviation (MSD) and peak-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are mathematical methods {{that can be}} used to measure the similarity of visual signals. However, MSD and PSNR scores often do not correlate well with the image quality <b>as</b> <b>perceive</b> <b>by</b> human observers (i.e., subjective scores) [4]. It is worth mentioning that, for an objective metric to be used in multimedia applications, its estimates must be well correlated with quality scores available in publicly available quality databases, which use standardized experimental procedures to measure the quality of a comprehensive series of visual signals.|$|R

25|$|The term shyness may be {{implemented}} as a lay blanket-term {{for a family}} of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including timidity (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence). Apparent shyness, <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or introversion, character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.|$|E

A sizeable lab in the field research facility allows the conservators to give the best possible on-site care while interacting with the excavations.

If energy resources and efficient production methods are found to make antimatter in the quantities required and store it safely, it would be theoretically possible to reach speeds of several tens of percent that of light. Whether antimatter propulsion {{could lead to the}} higher speeds (>90% that of light) at which relativistic time dilation would become more noticeable, thus making time pass at a slower rate for the travelers <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> an outside observer, is doubtful owing to the large quantity of antimatter that would be required.|$|E

In addition, Hayden noted that a contrast existed between the work activities of regular workers and NBA players, <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> typical employees, and that [...] "the NBA lockout may have strengthened {{the view of many}} that unions are out of touch with their lives and thus have little to offer them." ...|$|E
500|$|Wagner's final opera, Parsifal (1882), {{which was}} his only work written {{especially}} for his Bayreuth Festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a [...] "Bühnenweihfestspiel" [...] ("festival play for the consecration of the stage"), has a storyline suggested by elements of {{the legend of the}} Holy Grail. It also carries elements of Buddhist renunciation suggested by Wagner's readings of Schopenhauer. Wagner described it to Cosima as his [...] "last card". It remains controversial because of its treatment of Christianity, its eroticism, and its expression, <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> some commentators, of German nationalism and antisemitism. Despite the composer's own description of the opera to King Ludwig as [...] "this most Christian of works", Ulrike Kienzle has commented that [...] "Wagner's turn to Christian mythology, upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of Parsifal rest, is idiosyncratic and contradicts Christian dogma in many ways." [...] Musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composer's style, and Barry Millington describes it as [...] "a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement".|$|E

In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: [...] "It's beautiful to feel you touch people and bring a song to life with a video." [...] Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach. In an interview with Chandler Levack for Eye Weekly, Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> an audience.

500|$|Astral Weeks {{critical}} standing improved greatly over time. [...] It became {{viewed as}} one of rock's greatest records and a culturally significant work. A number of factors afforded the record its canonical reputation in rock criticism: its back story as a commercial underachiever and highly personal work for Morrison, its distinction {{from the rest of}} his discography, his artistic autonomy, the music's song cycle composition, the enigmatic lyrics, and the quality of seriousness and originality <b>as</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> mature rock audiences and writers. According to Rob Sheffield, it was Morrison's [...] "most beautiful and intense album", the foundation for his [...] "legend", and a work that continues to captivate musicians and listeners. Lester Bangs said its anguished feeling resonated with him on first listen, calling it [...] "the rock record with the most significance in my life so far ... a record about people stunned by life, completely overwhelmed, stalled in their skins, their ages and selves, paralyzed by the enormity of what in one moment of vision they can comprehend." [...] Irish musician Glen Hansard said it made him think about life with a greater depth of feeling, [...] "with a greater sense of fear and horror and desire than you ever imagined." [...] Colin Larkin credited Morrison for fully realizing his ambition to [...] "create without pop's constraints" [...] on Astral Weeks, while AllMusic's William Ruhlmann said its reputation among critics was justified because [...] "unlike any record before or since," [...] it [...] "encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music".|$|E
