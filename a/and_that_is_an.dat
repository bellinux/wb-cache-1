I think he genuinely has moved." [...] Blair reciprocated in describing Thatcher as a [...] "thoroughly determined person, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> admirable quality".|$|E
500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar were too big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw hat was a size too small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them. [...] Besides I’ve been over to Guttenberg [...] to-day, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and see me again.

2500|$|Matt Hinrichs from DVD Talk {{wrote that}} the season release is [...] "highly recommended." [...] He deemed the first season [...] "a snarky delight that {{crackles}} with hilarious situations and proudly non-p.c. characters." [...] Hinrichs also praised actresses Dennings and Behrs for their portrayal of Max and Caroline, highlighting the chemistry {{between them and the}} characters themselves as the series' [...] "winning formula." [...] The Numbers writer C.S. Strowbridge positively received the season, praising the chemistry between the two leads and the character development of several of the main characters while noting that [...] "calling it crass would be an understatement." [...] Strowbridge concluded, [...] "the style of humor will turn off as many people as it entertains <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> issue. I do think Season One got better as it went along and even though the DVD and the Blu-ray do not have a lot of extras, it is still worth picking up." [...] Todd Fuller of Sitcoms Online {{wrote that the}} series is [...] "an old fashioned sitcom like Laverne & Shirley and Alice. It works on many levels. The writing is a bit edgy and raunchy at times, but that's the trend in many comedies these days. Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs have great chemistry and comic timing together. The supporting cast at the diner is pretty funny in small doses. Jennifer Coolidge was also a welcome later addition to the cast." ...|$|E
