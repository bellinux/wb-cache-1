This research was part of the Bridge project, which was supported by funding from National Institute of Health NICHD (Grant R 01 HD 060789). iv Acoustic feature extraction algorithms play a central role in many speech and music processing applications. However, noise usually prevents acoustic feature extraction algorithms from obtaining the correct information from speech and music signals. Thus, the robustness of acoustic feature extraction algorithms is an area worth studying. In this thesis, we consider two important acoustic features: pitch and speaking rate. For each acoustic feature, we introduce several classic and state-of-the-art feature extraction algorithms and evaluate the performance of each of them in noisy environments. We analyze the results and provide possible explanations why some feature extraction algorithms outperform the others in noisy environments. ...|$|R

40|$|TRITA-ICT-EX- 2010 : 311 iii With {{the rapid}} advance in microelectronic technology, {{multiprocessor}} systemson-chip (MPSoCs) have become {{widely used in}} industry. Many researchers {{are trying to find}} more efficient ways to implement MPSoC systems with high performance, during which much more attention is paid on the synchronization of the inherent parallel processing elements. Being a special case of data flow models, synchronous data flow (SDF) has been used to model high-speed signal processing and multimedia systems, and to simulate the system level functional algorithms. Because of the exposed parallelism, streaming applications based on SDF models can be naturally implemented on MPSoC platforms. The aim of this project is to prototype these SDF graphs onto a FPGA based MPSoC platform. In order to achieve this, a suitable FPGA architecture, which fully matches the feature of SDF, should be built. The key feature of our platform is that we decouple the computation and data communicate tasks to processor and communication assistant. This makes processors could focus on computation tasks and improve the system performance. In our experiments, the MPSoC platform has shown higher performance than a single processor platform. Furthermore, different scheduling strategies, including static order and run-time order, are compared on MPSoC. The results have shown that the optimized static order strategy can achieve higher performance than run-time order strategy, with less buffer cost. iv Acknowledgements I would like to express my gratitude to all those who helped me during this master project.

After looking back to all my days here, I {{have to say the}} decision to come to Caltech for my graduate study is undoubtedly right. In spite of the unavoidable bitterness due to occasional failures in my research adventures, my overall experience at Caltech is quite enjoyable because of all the wonderful people I have met here. I would like to thank John and Jay for their great tutelage {{in the past several years}} at first. They taught me how to approach chemical problems rigorously and present research results precisely and elegantly. I admire their honest attitude towards science very much and highly appreciate the freedom they have given to me for the development of my own taste and interests in research. I am sure all I have learned here will benefit my research forever. Bob, Harry, and Linda have been very nice and helpful to me. I feel really lucky to have such a fantastic committee to give me <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> research and proposals and am very grateful for their help <b>on</b> <b>my</b> postdoctoral application...|$|R
40|$|My work is {{the result}} of the {{collective}} and collaborative support of many people. First of all, my deepest appreciation goes to Dr. Laurie Schick, my dissertation adviser, and Dr. Susan Garzon, my academic adviser, for their encouragement and guidance. Professor Schick opened up my eyes to the myriad possibilities for my research in the field of language socialization, especially among young children. Professor Schick has provided a true scaffold for me with her academic thoroughness and sincere mentorship from the very beginning and throughout the exploration of this project. I truly appreciate that she has been always <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side and with me whenever I needed her <b>advice</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> dissertation. I also cannot thank my academic adviser, Dr. Susan Garzon, enough. Professor Garzon has provided me with invaluable academic suggestions and undying support in all facets of my academic life. I have learned from her how to manage academic life and to keep a good balance between my study and other daily miseries. Professor Garzon has also helped me formulate and polish my thoughts and writings for my dissertation, especially in Chapters 2 and 6. I would also like to express my gratitude to my two other committee members. ...|$|R
