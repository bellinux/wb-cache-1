40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on {{embodiment}} aspects of communication between human <b>and</b> single function <b>artifact.</b> Communication with embodiment media between human <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> is difficult because of the difference of embodiment.

40|$|Stakeholder <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> are {{regarded}} as two important elements in software engineering processes, but they are rarely systematically investigated in software process modeling and simulation. Inspired by the Workshop of Modeling Systems and Software Engineering Processes in 2008 at University of Southern California and our previous studies on integrating stakeholders’ perspectives into software process modeling, we undertook {{a study on the}} application of these entities in software engineering, through both a systematic review and a complementary web survey within software process research and practice communities. Our results reveal that the portion of studies on process stakeholders <b>and</b> process <b>artifacts</b> in software engineering is unexpectedly small, and there lacks consistent understanding of process stakeholder roles. By further analysis of stakeholder roles <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> types based on our results, we define the stakeholder <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> in the lieu of software process engineering, and differentiate stakeholder <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> in different application scopes...|$|R

5|$|The Klondike Gold Rush was a {{migration}} by {{an estimated}} 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike {{region of the}} Yukon in north-western Canada between 1896 and 1899. Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, when news reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in photographs, books, films, <b>and</b> <b>artifacts.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} {{indigenous}} inhabitants of Key Biscayne were Tequestas. Shells, bones <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> {{found on the}} island indicate extensive use of it by the Tequesta. A large community appeared to inhabit the island between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew scoured much of the vegetation from {{the southern end of}} Key Biscayne. An archaeological survey of the exposed ground found evidence of extensive habitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{rich source}} of Late Paleolithic sites <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there {{contained}} {{the remains of a}} typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts of their culture, including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a dugout cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a hearth and imported materials) were discovered recently in Ćmielów, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County.|$|E

40|$|Automated or semiautomated pattern {{recognition}} in multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is strongly {{hampered by the}} large number of noise <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> peaks occurring under practical conditions. A general Bayesian method which is able to assign probabilities that observed peaks are members of given signal classes (e. g., the class of true resonance peaks or the class of noise <b>and</b> <b>artifact</b> peaks) was proposed previously. The discriminative power of this approach is dependent on the choice of the properties characterizing the peaks. The automated class recognition is improved by the addition of a nonlocal feature, the similarities of peak shapes in symmetry-related positions. It turns out that this additional property strongly decreases the overlap of the multivariate probability distributions for true signals and noise and hence largely increases the discrimination of true resonance peaks from noise <b>and</b> <b>artifact...</b>|$|R

5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit, and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low Earth orbit to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E
5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, {{where they were}} treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal. It is reported {{that it will take}} about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS Monitor, the original recovered turret, <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> and related items are now on display.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the ship would roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> of historic or military importance.|$|E

5|$|Malta has a {{long and}} rich history, and this is {{reflected}} in the island's cultural attractions. The Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans and the Byzantines have all occupied Malta at some point in history, leaving a mix of many different architectural styles <b>and</b> <b>artifacts</b> to explore. The sovereignty of the Knights Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta.
