40|$|An alkali metal, such as lithium, is the anodic reactant; {{carbon dioxide}} or {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide and carbon {{monoxide}} is the cathodic reactant; and carbonate of the alkali metal is the electrolyte in an electrochemical cell for the storage and delivery of electrical energy. Additionally, alkali metal-carbon dioxide battery systems include a plurality of such electrochemical cells. Gold is a preferred catalyst for reducing the carbon dioxide at the cathode. The fuel cell of the invention produces electrochemical energy through the use of an <b>anodic</b> <b>reactant</b> which is extremely energetic and light, and a cathodic reactant which can be extracted from its environment and therefore exacts no transportation penalty. The invention is, therefore, especially useful in extraterrestrial environments...|$|E
40|$|Our {{work on the}} electrocatalyzed {{oxidation}} of methanol {{was initially}} motivated by the interest in methanol as an <b>anodic</b> <b>reactant</b> in fuel cells. The literature on electrochemical oxidation of alcohols can be roughly grouped into two sets: fuel cell studies and inorganic chemistry studies. Work on fuel cells primarily focuses on surface-catalyzed oxidation at bulk metal anodes, usually Pt or Pt/Ru alloys. In the surface science/electrochemistry approach to these studies, single molecule catalysts are generally not considered. In contrast, the inorganic community investigates the electrooxidation of alcohols in homogeneous systems. Ruthenium complexes {{have been the most}} common catalysts in these studies. The alcohol substrates are typically either secondary alcohols (e. g., isopropanol) such that the reaction stops after 2 e{sup -} oxidation to the aldehyde and 4 e{sup -} oxidation to the carboxylic acid can be observed. Methanol, which can also undergo 6 e{sup -} oxidation to CO{sub 2 }, rarely appears in the homogeneous catalysis studies. Surface studies have shown that two types of metal centers with different functions result in more effective catalysts than a single metal; however, application of this concept to homogeneous systems has not been demonstrated. The major thrust of the work is to apply this insight from the surface studies to homogeneous catalysis. Even though homogeneous systems would not be appropriate models for active sites on Pt/Ru anodes, it is possible that heterobimetallic catalysts could also utilize two metal centers for different roles. Starting from that perspective, this work involves the preparation and investigation of heterobinuclear catalysts for the electrochemical oxidation of methanol...|$|E
40|$|The intense use {{of fossil}} fuels {{in the last two}} centuries is {{primarily}} responsible for global warming and severe environmental pollution. Moreover, the progressive depletion of the oil/gas resources and the strong dependence on foreign suppliers create national vulnerabilities. In this context, the development of renewable energy sources and the implementation of electric vehicles for transportation is becoming a worldwide imperative. Solar radiation, wind and waves are discontinuous energy sources, thus their use requires efficient energy storage devices to balance the supply with the demand. The most convenient way to store the energy is to convert it into chemical energy and, on demand, convert it back to electrical energy. This is exactly what batteries do. Batteries can also provide the portability of the stored energy and possess the ability to deliver the electricity with high efficiency and without gaseous emission. The development of batteries that can store sustainable energy with long term stability and have a very prolonged cycle life without environmental constraints {{is one of the main}} challenges of the 21 st century. This is true also in the field of transportation where the use of electric vehicles will reduce the use of oil and pollution. Batteries with high energy and power densities, extended life and high safety are hence required. This type of “green revolution”, implying an extended use of renewable energy sources to replace oil or carbon, may occur using Lithium ion batteries that dominate the consumer market (they are sold in billion pieces for laptop computers, cameras, etc) because of their ability to store a high density of energy, their high efficiency and prolonged cycle life. The performance of these devices depends on the physical-chemical properties of the <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>reactants.</b> The current lithium-ion technology is satisfactory for consumer electronics, but a quantum jump is necessary to meet the requirements for applications such as electric cars. Thus the research of new and advanced materials is currently challenging materials scientists. The research work presented in this thesis deals with the investigation of the electrochemical properties of electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries. Two different aspects have been studied that are both driven toward the development of greener, safer and cheaper lithium ion batteries. In the first part of my PhD thesis, the relationships between structural features and electrochemical performances of LiFePO 4, a promising cathode material, have been investigated. The structure of LiFePO 4 has been modified by introduction of vanadium (doping) in an attempt to overcome the intrinsic limitation (i. e. low electrical conductivity) of this material. The synthesized materials, with different concentrations of dopant, have better electrochemical performances than the pure LiFePO 4. The structural modifications induced by vanadium were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and Synchrotron X-rays Absorption Spectroscopy and correlated with the improved electrochemical performances. The second part of the present dissertation describes the results obtained during my six months spent as a visiting PhD student at MEET (Münster Electrochemical Energy Technology) at the WWU University of Münster, Germany, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Stefano Passerini. The work deals with the study of the effect water processible binders on anatase TiO 2 anode electrochemical performances. The electrodes manufactured using aqueous binders showed improved electrochemical performance with respect to those made using traditional fluorinated binders. A full lithium ion cell comprising TiO 2 anode and a high voltage cathode, both prepared using water as solvent (instead of toxic liquids) was assembled and successfully cycled The results reported within this thesis have been the subject of the following publications: A.
