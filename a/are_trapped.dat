5|$|The {{size of the}} {{respiratory}} tract and the flow of air also protect the lungs from larger particles. Smaller particles deposit in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in nasal hair after inhalation.|$|E
5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E
50|$|A knight which reaches {{one of the}} two far ranks <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> as <b>is</b> a pawn which captures {{and thus}} {{promotes}} there. Likewise, a pawn that reaches the far rank <b>is</b> <b>trapped,</b> as <b>is</b> a knight which captures there. A lance <b>is</b> also <b>trapped</b> at the far rank, but can escape if it captures there and thus demotes to a silver. A silver which captures in the far rank and therefore promotes to a lance <b>is</b> <b>trapped.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cass Cave is a cave {{located in}} Cass, West Virginia, on Cheat Mountain. On March 16, 1968, 8 people <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> and later rescued {{in the cave}}. In 1976, an amateur caver <b>was</b> <b>trapped</b> in the cave for more than 15 hours, falling 40 feet to the cave floor after an {{equipment}} malfunction.In 1977, a climber <b>was</b> <b>trapped</b> in the waterfall and froze to death.|$|R
50|$|Each {{defending}} {{player who}} <b>was</b> <b>trapped,</b> {{has to pay}} {{a tribute to the}} offense team. A tribute is the highest card in his hand. The trapped player (#6) has to give one card to the player who escaped first (#1). If two players <b>were</b> <b>trapped,</b> then #5 has to give one card to #2. If three players <b>were</b> <b>trapped,</b> then #4 would have to give one card to #3.|$|R
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} in the water, {{oxygen and}} other gases <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in {{a type of}} structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{involves}} a couple, Annie and Alex, vacationing in the Caribbean aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is hijacked by a villain named Geiger. As they <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> aboard the ship, Annie and Alex {{work with the}} ship's first officer {{to try to stop}} it after they discover it is programmed to crash into an oil tanker.|$|E
5|$|While {{they are}} {{expensive}} pieces of equipment, their popularity and adoption by firefighters in the United States is increasing markedly {{due to the}} increased availability of government equipment grants following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Thermal imaging cameras pick up body heat, and they are normally used in cases where people <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> where rescuers cannot find them.|$|E
5000|$|One {{source says}} Kinan <b>was</b> <b>trapped</b> by {{prostitution}} for twenty years. Another {{says that she}} <b>was</b> <b>trapped</b> in a brothel for nearly twenty years. Another reports that she <b>was</b> <b>trapped</b> in sexual servitude for twenty years. Another claims that she was [...] "a victim of trafficking networks and male clients for two decades."

50|$|Construction {{of water}} {{developments}} in xeric habitat in Arizona may provide habitat and water for white-throated woodrats. On the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Arizona, white-throated woodrats <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> {{most often in}} velvet Mesquite Bosque thickets that grew closest to a human constructed water development. White-throated woodrats <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> least often in habitat dominated by creosotebush and furthest away (distance not given) from the water development. No white-throated woodrats <b>were</b> <b>trapped</b> at a nearby dry water development.|$|R
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has}} been caught in a strange cloud belt. They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} David Tennant—and his companion Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> {{in the past}} and try to communicate with a young woman, Sally Sparrow (Carey Mulligan), to prevent the statue-like Weeping Angels from taking control of the TARDIS. Sparrow and her best friend's brother, Larry Nightingale (Finlay Robertson), must unravel a set of cryptic clues sent through time by the marooned Doctor, left in the abandoned estate Wester Drumlins which the Angels currently occupy.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing gear is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
5|$|Scott Gorman (William Hope) is {{commanding}} officer of the mission to LV-426, and the Colonial Marines do not take kindly to the inexperienced lieutenant. Although he performs adequately when they initially secure the empty colony, he quickly loses {{control of the situation}} when the Aliens ambush his troops. Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks. During the Aliens' assault on the operations room, Gorman tries to rescue Vasquez but his pistol runs out of ammunition. Realizing they <b>are</b> <b>trapped,</b> they embrace and detonate a grenade (taking a number of Aliens with them).|$|E

5|$|The Boss {{wakes up}} in a 1950s sitcom set {{in the city of}} Pleasantville, devoid of {{violence}} and foul language. The Saints' computer hacking specialist, Kinzie Kensington, contacts the Boss and informs them that they <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> inside a simulation, with each of the Zin's prisoners trapped inside personal simulations of their own fears in order to break their will. With Kinzie's help, the Boss breaks free of the simulation and joins Kinzie and Keith in a stolen Zin ship.|$|E
5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along with schools of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises <b>are</b> <b>trapped</b> in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed {{over and over again}} until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented.
