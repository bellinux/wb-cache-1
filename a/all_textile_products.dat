40|$|<b>Textile</b> <b>products</b> are everywhere, from {{covering}} {{our bodies}} to populating our homes and workplaces. Is it unsurprising then {{that millions of}} tons of textiles are ending up in waste? This paper critically reflects on a 2009 Refashion case study. It discusses the current process of reuse in the fashion industry, drawing attention to the further potential of design for reuse. Reusing and remaking used clothing was a long-standing practice that began as a way of extending the life of valuable resources. This sensitivity and respect for <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> changed in the 20 th century with the growth of mass produced clothing and low cost off-shore manufacturing. Buyers, exploiting the low cost, capitalised on their economic strength, through larger orders in excess of their needs. This overproduction and excess stock directly fed the habits of a consumerist society demanding more for less. Current patterns of fashion consumerism have resulted in overproduction and overconsumption. This coupled with lower quality product and fast changing trends, has stimulated a ‘throwaway’ culture. Equally the inferior quality of mass produced clothing has limited its desire as a reuse option. The ubiquity of textile is its downfall, this devaluation has permeated <b>all</b> <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> and consequently {{millions of tons of}} textiles are consigned to landfill globally. Refashion is an intervention in the 'take, make, waste' lifecycle of a garment. It is a slow growing, upcycling movement that reuses discarded clothing to produce new items for return to the fashion stream. This paper examines the perceived barriers of the Refashion process that currently limits the scale of the manufacturing operation. Findings in the Refashion case study support the feasibility of the process as a manufacturing method. Therefore the potential for Refashion, if it were more commonly practiced, is to divert large volumes of textile waste from landfill and reduce the demand on the environment: Refashion reuses the textile, maintains the original value added and delivers a new fashion item without the environmental problems required by virgin textile. This paper specifically focuses on component reuse: as a way of extending the life of the textile prior to recycling the fibre; and elucidates the process. The author identifies the benefits of a component reuse process built into the lifecycle of a fashion product and highlights the need for fashion designers and manufacturers to design for reuse...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the impact on}} the environment of textile products, highlighting that their pollution is primarily exerted on air and water. Textile industry affects the environment through the consumption of water, energy and chemicals, {{as a result of the}} existence of a great number of processes through which fibers are passing until they are transformed into finished products, and the large amount of waste they generate. They may be recoverable (resulting from the spinning phases, yarn waste from spinning mills, weaving mills, knitting, weaving heads and strips from weaving mills and cutting section, patches from the cutting stages etc.) returned to the manufacturing process they can be used to obtain vicuna yarns, non-woven textile fabrics, cotton upholstery for furniture and cars, insulating materials, geotextiles, etc. or irrecoverable – which are incinerated or discarded in landfills - polluting both air and ground. Waste generation involves a loss of materials and energy and imposes high environmental and economic costs to society - of collection, treatment and processing. Therefore we believe that the desire of "zero waste" is currently one of the strategic directions for sustainable development of a society based on knowledge. Suggested solutions to reduce pollution exercised by textiles products various measures were proposed, such as: sound management of waste, recycling and the increase of "green" products in the <b>all</b> <b>textile</b> <b>products...</b>|$|E

30|$|Denim as a fabric, has {{received}} the widest acceptance among <b>all</b> <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> It has had an incredible influence on consumers both socially and culturally (Paul 2015). This twill cotton fabric usually has warp threads indigo dyed while weft remains plain white. The warp faced fabric therefore looks blue {{on one side and}} white on reverse. The warp being ring dyed, creates denim’s fading characteristics, which is unique compared to every other textile material. With changing times, many new variants of denim came into existence. Denim washing {{is one of the key}} areas in getting the faded look. Earlier stone washing used to be done to achieve soft feel and the desired appearance. During washing, the pumice stone, scraps off the dye particles from the yarn surface in the denim fabric. Due to the ring dyeing of denim fabric and heavy abrasion during stone washing process, the faded effect is achieved. Oxidative bleaching agent with or without the addition of stones have also been used to get fading effect. Difficulty in removing residual pumice from fabric, damage to equipment and clogging of machine drainage passage due to particulate material proved to be major drawbacks with the technique (Heikinheimo et al. 2000). Later on use of enzymes became a sustainable option to get the worn out look in denim. The enzymes used are cellulase enzymes, specifically acting on the cellulose part, mainly on the surface of the fabric. This gives the desired look and at the same time, removes hairiness from surface thus giving a smooth and soft feel. Enzymes are substrate specific in their action, unaffecting the others. They are primarily used in textiles to promote hydrolysis of the required substrate (Patra 2003).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. <b>Textile</b> <b>product</b> {{labels are}} {{provided}} on the clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> to assist consumers with important product information. However, the assumption cannot {{be made that}} because the label is available on these products {{it will be used}} by consumers. Consumers do not base their pre– and post–purchasing decisions on reality but rather on what they perceive to be the reality. Thus consumers’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels need to be studied as it influences their pre– and post–purchasing decisions and use of these labels. Consumers use their perceptions as a frame of reference for making purchasing decisions. This study determined consumers’ perceptions, in order to form a better understanding of their textile pre– and post–purchasing decisions. However, perception is not a singular concept but an interactive process. Therefore, the present study, done in the Gauteng Province, aimed to determine consumers’ perceptions of clothing and household textile labels, by focusing on the perceptual process of consumers. The first objective was to determine consumers’ awareness of labels on clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> Secondly, it was determined whether consumers’ attention is drawn to labels of clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> Thirdly it was determined whether labels on <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> are important to consumers and finally, whether consumers interpret labels on <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> An interviewer–administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. A total of 411 questionnaires were administered by trained fieldworkers. The study location was three different regions in Gauteng Province, namely: Pretoria, Vereeniging and the West Rand. Public locations were used for the recruitment of respondents selected within the three regions, which included: schools, retirement villages, parking areas and government institutions. This contributed to the probability that a diverse group of respondents participated. The study population consisted of 44. 5 % males and 55. 5 % females. The home languages most spoken among the respondents were English (20. 9 %), Afrikaans (21. 1 %) or isiZulu (16. 5 %). Respondents generally tended to have a positive perception regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels. The results illustrated that respondents tended to agree to be aware of label information and that the front and back panels of the label draw their attention. However respondents tended to be neutral as to whether the information is important enough to read. Respondents mostly agreed that they interpret the symbols on <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels. Although respondents tended to perceive <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels positively, it still remains unclear whether it is important enough for consumers to use these labels found on <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> By striving to improve consumers’ perceptions regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels through better labelling initiatives and consumer education on labels, consumers might view labels as important and use them before and after purchasing a <b>textile</b> <b>product.</b> This will in effect teach consumers how to clean and maintain <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> to extend the product’s lifespan. This would in turn contribute to the consumer’s pre– and post–purchasing satisfaction. This study additionally found that respondents’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels were influenced by some of their demographic characteristics. Although there were no large effect sizes which illustrated practical significance, there were some small to medium tendencies regarding respondents’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels and their demographic characteristics. Different tendencies were especially found when analysing the relationships between respondents’ perceptions and age or language. Older respondents (60 and older) tended to have a more positive perception of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels than younger respondents (18 to 29 years). In addition, respondents with an African language as their home language seemed to differ from Afrikaans and English respondents. To understand South African consumers fully, researchers should understand the diversity and political history of South Africa, by focusing on cultural differences and reasons thereof. Different age generations need to be examined in further South African studies {{in order to determine the}} perceptions of consumers from different age groups regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels.

40|$|This article {{makes an}} {{objective}} {{assessment of the}} impact of economic reforms of 1991 on productivity change in Indian manufacturing at a disaggregated level of industrial classification. Using the state-level inputâ€“output quantity data constructed from Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) measured rates of productivity change in selected two-digit manufacturing industries show that at the all-India level, only in cotton textile and chemical and chemical products industries productivity growth slowed down considerably after the reforms. While productivity in other industries improved after the reforms, there was evidence of inter-industry variation in productivity growth rates. State-level estimates show that not only in the leading but also in laggard industrial states the selected industries have experienced improvement in productivity after the reforms. For most of the industries the coefficient of variation in the rate of productivity changes across states diminished significantly after the reforms. But the reverse is true for cotton textiles and chemical and chemical products industries, suggesting that in these two industries the individual states failed to reap the benefit of reforms in a uniform manner. Also for <b>all</b> industries except <b>textile</b> <b>products,</b> technological progress was the prime driving force behind the productivity growth over the post-reform years.
