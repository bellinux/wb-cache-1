25|$|The {{aviation}} {{travel industry}} {{is affected by}} the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to taking {{a wide range}} prey, gulls display great versatility in how they obtain prey. Prey can be obtained in the air, on water, or on land. In the air, a number of hooded species are able to hawk insects on the wing; larger species perform this feat more rarely. Gulls on the wing also snatch items both off water and off the ground, and over water they also plunge-dive to catch prey. Again, smaller species are more manoeuvrable and better able to hover-dip fish from the air. Dipping is also common when birds <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water, and gulls may swim in tight circles or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrates up to the surface. Food is also obtained by searching the ground, often on the shore among sand, mud or rocks. Larger gulls tend to do more feeding in this way. In shallow water gulls may also engage in foot paddling. A method of obtaining prey unique to gulls involves dropping heavy shells of clams and mussels onto hard surfaces. Gulls may fly some distance to find a suitable surface on which to drop shells, and apparently a learned component to the task exists, as older birds are more successful than younger ones. While overall feeding success {{is a function of}} age, the diversity in both prey and feeding methods is not. The time taken to learn foraging skills may explain the delayed maturation in gulls.|$|E

500|$|The {{four-year}} {{association with}} Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The {{first of the}} major works was the orchestral A Song of Summer, based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of A Poem of Life and Love. In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to [...] "imagine that we <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cliffs in the heather, {{looking out over the}} sea". This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of Walt Whitman poems with the title Songs of Farewell, was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: [...] "the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings..." [...] combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its [...] "hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in A Mass of Life". Payne describes the work as [...] "bracing and exultant, with in places an almost Holstian clarity".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Stan {{changing}} {{from the police}} outfit she ended up with in the [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] video into a red dress in a dressing room. Following this, she walks down a staircase into a saloon bar and sings to the bar's crowd. Afterwards, a man makes appearance {{at the bar and}} plays cards with Stan in front of all people. Subsequently, the police men who arrested Stan in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] enter the bar looking for her. They eventually see her and try to arrest her again. However, the man that played cards with the singer defends her, beginning to bar-fight with the police men; they win the fight, with all people lying on the floor. Upon next, the police men <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bar stool next to the bar man and are presented a tape. Meanwhile, it is shown in a flashback in sepia that, while the men were bar-fighting, Stan was grabbing the money from the cards and ran out of the bar. The video ends with one of the police man punching the bar man. Scenes interspersed throughout the main plot present Stan singing in front of an old-fashioned wall, sporting a white worn blouse and hot pants. An editor from Los 40 Principales cited the video for [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] as one of the singer's best clips ever. Hamard from Pure Charts wrote that the visual would have an impact on males and deemed Stan as [...] "sensual".|$|E

Here and there, where some three or four couple <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass together, you will see a sun-burnt woman in a red cloak ‘telling fortunes’ and prophesying husbands, which it requires no extraordinary observation to describe, for the originals are before her. Thereupon, the lady concerned laughs and blushes, and ultimately buries her face in an imitation cambric handkerchief, and the gentleman described looks extremely foolish, and squeezes her hand, and fees the gipsy liberally; and the gipsy goes away, perfectly satisfied herself, and leaving those behind her perfectly satisfied also: and the prophecy, like many other prophecies of greater importance, fulfils itself in time.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{think it}} my duty, Nicholas, my dear,' resumed his mother, 'to {{tell you what}} I know: not only {{because you have a}} right to know it too, and to know {{everything}} that happens in this family, but because you have it in your power to promote and assist the thing very much; and there is no doubt that the sooner one can come to a clear understanding on such subjects, it is always better, every way. There are a great many things you might do; such as taking a walk in the garden sometimes, or sitting upstairs in your own room for a little while, or making believe to fall asleep occasionally, or pretending that you recollected some business, and going out for an hour or so, and taking Mr Smike with you. These seem very slight things, and I dare say you will be amused at my making them of so much importance; at the same time, my dear, I can assure you (and you'll find this out, Nicholas, for yourself one of these days, if you ever fall in love with anybody; as I trust and hope you will, provided she is respectable and well conducted, and of course you'd never dream of falling in love with anybody who was not), I say, I can assure you that a great deal more depends upon these little things than you would suppose possible. If your poor papa was alive, he would tell you how much depended on the parties being left alone. Of course, you are not to go out of the room as if you meant it and did it on purpose, but as if it was quite an accident, and to come back again in the same way. If you cough in the passage before you open the door, or whistle carelessly, or hum a tune, or something of that sort, to let them know you're coming, it's always better; because, of course, though it's not only natural but perfectly correct and proper under the circumstances, still it is very confusing if you interrupt young people when they are--when they <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, and--and all that sort of thing: which is very nonsensical, perhaps, but still they will do it.' ...|$|E
