5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution.

5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a binary star system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles).

5|$|Mayer was {{introduced}} to topology by his colleague Vietoris when attending his lectures in 1926 and 1927 at a local university in Vienna. He was told about the conjectured result {{and a way to}} its solution, and solved the question for the Betti numbers in 1929. He applied his results to the torus considered as the union of two cylinders. Vietoris later proved the full result for the homology groups in 1930 but did not express it as <b>an</b> <b>exact</b> sequence. The concept of <b>an</b> <b>exact</b> sequence only appeared in print in the 1952 book Foundations of Algebraic Topology by Samuel Eilenberg and Norman Steenrod where the results of Mayer and Vietoris were expressed in the modern form.|$|E

5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although <b>an</b> <b>exact</b> number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E

New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
