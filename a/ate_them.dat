5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also <b>ate</b> <b>them.</b> But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E

In May 2008, Gail finally met Ted Page, the father she had never known and in 2009, Gail's boyfriend, Joe McIntyre became addicted to pain killers, which came to a head when he broke into the medical centre.

500|$|Albatrosses {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most legendary of all birds". An albatross is a central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge; a captive albatross is also a metaphor for the poète maudit in a poem by Charles Baudelaire. It is from the Coleridge poem that the albatross metaphor is derived; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have [...] "an albatross around his neck", the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who killed the albatross. There is a widespread myth that sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross, {{due in part to the}} poem; in truth, sailors regularly killed and <b>ate</b> <b>them,</b> as reported by James Cook in 1772. On the other hand, it has been reported that sailors caught the birds but let them free again; the possible reason is that albatrosses were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors, so killing them was supposed to bring bad luck. The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape Horners, i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail; captains of such ships even received themselves the title [...] "albatrosses" [...] in the Cape Horners' organisation.|$|E
