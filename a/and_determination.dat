40|$|Attitude <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination</b> are {{critical}} parts of nanosatellite mission operations. The {{ability to perform}} attitude <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination</b> autonomously {{could lead to a}} wider array of mission possibilities for nanosatellites. This research examines the feasibility of using low-cost magnetometer measurements as a method of autonomous, simultaneous orbit <b>and</b> attitude <b>determination</b> for the novel application of redundancy on nanosatellites. Extended Kalman Filters (EKFs) are developed for attitude <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination.</b> Simulations are run to compare the developed systems with previous work on attitude <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination.</b> The EKFs are combined to provide both attitude <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination</b> simultaneously. Simulations show that this approach for simultaneous, autonomous attitude <b>and</b> orbit <b>determination</b> on nanosatellites provides 8. 5 degrees and 12. 5 km of attitude and orbit knowledge, respectively. The results of the simulations are then validated using Hardware-In-The-Loop testing. Additionally, a Helmholtz cage is evaluated for future use in the Hardware-In-The-Loop test setup...|$|R
