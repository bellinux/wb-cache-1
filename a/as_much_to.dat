5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness. The reasons for this have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Strategic Air Command {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E

5|$|The {{making of}} a kingship of Ireland, as kings from Flann to Brian Bóruma, Muircheartach Ua Briain and Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair (Turlough O'Connor) exercised, may owe <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the threat raised by Feidlimid mac Crimthainn, of the Eóganachta of Cashel (Eóganachta Chaisil), King of Munster, as to the Viking raids on Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{the first}} couple of years of his company, Goldfaden did not shy away from serious themes: his rained-out {{vaudeville}} in Botoşani had been Di Rekruten (The Recruits), playing with the theme of the press gangs working the streets of that town to conscript young men into the army. Before the end of 1876, Goldfaden had already translated Desolate Island by August von Kotzebue; thus, a play by a German aristocrat and Russian spy became the first non-comic play performed professionally in Yiddish. After his initial burst of mostly vaudevilles and light comedies (although Shmendrik and The Two Kuni-Lemls were reasonably sophisticated plays), Goldfaden would go on to write many serious Yiddish-language plays on Jewish themes, perhaps the most famous being Shulamith, also from 1880. Goldfaden himself suggested that this increasingly serious turn became possible because he had educated his audience. Nahma Sandrow suggests that it may have had equally <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the arrival in Romania, {{at the time of the}} Russo-Turkish War, of Russian Jews who had been exposed to more sophisticated Russian language theater. Goldfaden's strong turn toward almost uniformly serious subject matter roughly coincided with bringing his troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electric}} streetcars in San Francisco began {{operation in}} 1892 {{under the auspices}} of the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway. At that time, it was estimated that it cost twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> build and six times <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> operate a line with cable cars as with electric streetcars.|$|E
25|$|The main poets of {{this period}} include Dáibhí Ó Bruadair, (1625?1698), Piaras Feiritéar (1600?1653) and Aogán Ó Rathaille (16751729). Ó Rathaille belongs <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the 18th as the 17th century and his work, {{including}} {{the introduction of the}} aisling genre, marks something of a transition to a post Battle of the Boyne Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Fritz Todt {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on 8 February 1942, shortly after a meeting with Hitler in East Prussia. Todt had become {{convinced}} that the war on the eastern front could not be won and thought himself independent enough to say <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> Hitler. As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a covert assassination, but this has never been substantiated.|$|E

Even if Smith meant that he was talking about John Mitchell, the former Attorney General, Gray further points out that no one (outside of the conspirators) knew of Mitchell's {{involvement}} until the following April, when John Dean admitted <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> special prosecutors.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a week of}} the deaths, {{state troopers}} had put up {{flashing}} warning signs {{at both ends of}} the segment.

Two years after its implementation, {{a study published in}} The Tennessean showed that the percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level had increased from 53% to 74%. However, a report by the think tank Education Sector suggested that specific teacher training had at least <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the student improvement.|$|E
25|$|The city of Washington, D.C. {{prepared}} for assault {{in the midst}} of one of the worst hot spells in its history, sustaining 47 days without rain with temperatures in the nineties. The Congress and prominent residents such as Montgomery Blair left town <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> escape the heat as much as the impending Confederate advance. President Lincoln remained near the city, staying with his family at the Soldier's Home in present-day Northeast Washington, yet a steamer waited on the Potomac to evacuate the president if the situation became too dire. Meanwhile, refugees from surrounding counties began to enter the relative safety of the city.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s housing {{development}} was scattered across several locations: most was along Pelham Road, {{of which the}} majority was east of the original village (St Andrew's church), centred around the County Hotel, {{and close to the}} dock estate; further development had taken place south and south east of the church, also on Pelham Road, in two locations each centred on one of the two nonconformist chapels. Almost all the housing was terraced, with the more generous ground plans found moving southwest along Pelham Road. By the mid 1930s the village had grown <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> require a comprehensive school which opened in 1936.|$|E

The timber for her hull and cabins was cut in the mountains and hauled or floated to the construction site, where it was sawn into planks and other components for the vessel.

25|$|Social {{commentator}} Mike Davis {{pointed to}} the growing economic disparity in Los Angeles in the {{years leading up to}} the riots caused by corporate restructuring and government deregulation, with inner-city residents bearing the brunt of these changes. Such conditions engendered a widespread feeling of frustration and powerlessness in the urban populace, with the King verdicts eventually setting off their resentments in a violent expression of collective public protest. To Davis and other writers, the tensions witnessed between African-Americans and Korean-Americans during the unrest was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the economic competition forced on the two groups by wider market forces as with either cultural misunderstandings or blacks angered about the killing of Latasha Harlins.|$|E
25|$|Kipling's birth home on {{the campus}} of the J J School of Art in Bombay was for many years used as the Dean's residence. Although the cottage bears a plaque noting it as the site where Kipling was born, the {{original}} cottage may have been torn down decades ago and a new one built in its place. Some historians and conservationists are also of the view that the bungalow marks a site that is merely close to the home of Kipling's birth, as the bungalow was built in 1882—about 15 years after Kipling was born. In fact, Kipling seems to have said <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the Dean when he visited J J School in the 1930s.|$|E
