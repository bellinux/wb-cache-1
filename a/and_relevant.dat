5|$|A {{task force}} was formed, {{comprising}} polytechnic principals and representatives from Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) {{to explore the}} feasibility of a new model that built upon the Poly-FSI initiative. The task force visited selected universities and specialised institutions in USA, UK and Australia. It also held focus group discussions with various stakeholders such as polytechnic students and alumni, their parents, economic agencies <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> industry players.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm II {{was born}} to Kenneth II of Scotland. He was {{grandson}} of Malcolm I of Scotland. In 997, the killer of Constantine is credited as being Kenneth, son of Malcolm. Since there is no known <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> Kenneth alive at that time (King Kenneth having died in 995), it is considered an error for either Kenneth III, who succeeded Constantine, or, possibly, Malcolm himself, the son of Kenneth II. Whether Malcolm killed Constantine or not, {{there is no doubt}} that in 1005 he killed Constantine's successor Kenneth III in battle at Monzievaird in Strathearn.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years after}} his conversion, Lecrae teamed up with Ben Washer to found Reach Records, and {{at the age of}} 25 he {{released}} his first album, Real Talk. The following year it was re-released by Cross Movement Records and reached No. 29 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks. The album later received a nomination at the 2007 Stellar Awards. In 2005, Lecrae co-founded the non-profit organization ReachLife Ministries (no longer operational since April 2015), which equipped local Christian leaders with tools, media, curriculum, and conferences that were based on the teachings of the Bible <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> to hip-hop culture. Also in 2005, the debut album of 116 Clique, The Compilation Album, was released.|$|E

5|$|In February 2008, new {{executive}} producer, Susan Bower, {{announced that}} she would be implementing further changes to the programme. Bower promised to retain the return to traditional Neighbours values, but with an injection of drama that remains recognisable <b>and</b> <b>relevant.</b> Ratings rose to almost 900,000 in mid-2008, but generally ratings begin to fall towards the end of each year, usually averaging around 700,000. On 17 July 2009, during the aftermath of the Parker family's car accident and the dramatic death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), Neighbours achieved higher ratings than Home And Away. Neighbours achieved 998,000 viewers and placed 6th for the night, Home And Away placed 7th.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} inconsistencies {{the subjective}} test had {{with respect to}} Articles12 and 93 of the Constitution were sought to be resolved {{with the passing of}} the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989. Article149(1) was amended to shield any anti-subversion laws enacted pursuant to this provision from inconsistency with Articles11 and 12. This was in addition to Articles 9, 13 and 14 which had already been present in Article149(1) before the amendment. Furthermore, a new Article149(3) provided that nothing in Article93 would invalidate any provisions that were enacted pursuant to Article149. Hence, the ruling in Chng Suan Tze that the subjective test was inconsistent with the Constitution was legislatively reversed, and the subjective test was restored as the valid <b>and</b> <b>relevant</b> law in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives of development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed <b>and</b> <b>relevant,</b> the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
