25|$|In {{the case}} of N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the {{reactive}} cytochrome P450-reactive metabolite formed by paracetamol (acetaminophen), which becomes toxic when GSH is depleted by an overdose of acetaminophen, glutathione is an essential antidote to overdose. Glutathione conjugates to NAPQI and helps to detoxify it. In this capacity, it protects cellular protein thiol groups, which would otherwise become covalently modified; when all GSH has been spent, NAPQI begins to react with the cellular proteins, killing the cells in the process. The preferred treatment for an overdose of this painkiller is the administration (usually in <b>atomized</b> form) of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (often as a preparation called Mucomyst), which is processed by cells to L-cysteine and used in the de novo synthesis of GSH.|$|E

The relative frequency of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology. An illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd's case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways.

30|$|It {{is a great}} {{challenge}} to find effective <b>atomizing</b> technology for reducing industrial pollution; the twin-fluid <b>atomizing</b> nozzle has drawn great attention in this field recently. Current studies on twin-fluid nozzles mainly focus on droplet breakup and single droplet characteristics. Research relating to the influences of structural parameters on the droplet diameter characteristics in the flow field is scarcely available. In this paper, {{the influence of a}} self-excited vibrating cavity structure on droplet diameter characteristics was investigated. Twin-fluid <b>atomizing</b> tests were performed by a self-built open <b>atomizing</b> test bench, which was based on a phase Doppler particle analyzer (PDPA). The <b>atomizing</b> flow field of the twin-fluid nozzle with a self-excited vibrating cavity and its absence were tested and analyzed. Then the <b>atomizing</b> flow field of the twin-fluid nozzle with different self-excited vibrating cavity structures was investigated. The experimental results show that the structural parameters of the self-excited vibrating cavity had a great effect on the breakup of large droplets. The Sauter mean diameter (SMD) increased with the increase of orifice diameter or orifice depth. Moreover, a smaller orifice diameter or orifice depth was beneficial to enhancing the turbulence around the outlet of nozzle and decreasing the SMD. The <b>atomizing</b> performance was better when the orifice diameter was 2.0  mm or the orifice depth was 1.5  mm. Furthermore, the SMD increased first and then decreased with the increase of the distance between the nozzle outlet and self-excited vibrating cavity, and the SMD of more than half the <b>atomizing</b> flow field was under 35  μm when the distance was 5.0  mm. In addition, with the increase of axial and radial distance from the nozzle outlet, the SMD and arithmetic mean diameter (AMD) tend to increase. The research results provide some design parameters for the twin-fluid nozzle, and the experimental results could serve as a beneficial supplement to the twin-fluid nozzle study.|$|R

2500|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{is responsible for}} introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air.

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} intercoolers, it is common practice to add extra fuel to the intake air (known as [...] "running an engine rich") {{for the sole purpose of}} cooling. The amount of extra fuel varies, but typically reduces the air-fuel ratio to between 11 and 13, instead of the stoichiometric 14.7 (in petrol engines). The extra fuel is not burned (as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction), instead it undergoes a phase change from <b>atomized</b> (liquid) to gas. This phase change absorbs heat, and the added mass of the extra fuel reduces the average thermal energy of the charge and exhaust gas. Even when a catalytic converter is used, the practice of running an engine rich increases exhaust emissions.|$|E

[...] Some critics question other social implications of the movement's focus on body modification.
