5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of bullet holes in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> of books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E

5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E

5|$|Three of the {{founding}} members of Thirsty Merc – Matthew Baker, Karl Robertson, <b>and</b> Phil <b>Stack</b> – had played together in various bands in Dubbo, a regional New South Wales city.

25|$|Because of {{the complex}} {{geological}} history of the Pacific Northwest, the geography of the Oregon Coast is diversely varied, and is often separated into different regions based on geological formations. Three primary landforms are common along the Oregon coast, and help distinguish the regions based on their frequency of occurrence and location {{in relation to the}} shoreline: sea cliffs, beaches, <b>and</b> <b>stacks.</b> However, because of this, it is difficult to divide the Oregon Coast into uniform and clear cut regions. Despite this, The Oregon Coast is traditionally divided into three distinct regions; The North Coast, Central Coast, and South Coast. Because of minor land variation between the North and Central Coast regions, the division between these two regions is a more of a civil division than that of a geological division. This is due mostly to the larger cities in the North Coast region than in the Central Coast region. However, several minor differences do exist between the two regions, both in terms of geology and socioeconomic differences.|$|E

The graphene sheets are easily stacked each other due to van der Waals attraction. The folded characteristic may prevent graphene <b>stacking</b> <b>and</b> increase the d-spacing between graphenes. It can easily form dense graphene structures with high surface area and be applied on electrode materials of battery, nano-composites and so on. The traditional topographic mapping of {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) is hard to measure the characters of surface deformation and distinguish the folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking.</b> In this study, we apply a novel quantitative nano-mechanical AFM to analyze the reduced-graphene oxide (r-GO). The {{results indicate that the}} novel AFM system could recognize the difference between folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking</b> of r-GO effectively. Nevertheless, the images including topography, deformation, adhesion, and elastic modulus show the different phenomena between measuring region, which appears that status on measuring region are folding <b>and</b> <b>stacking,</b> respectively...|$|R

Smaller islets <b>and</b> <b>stacks</b> in the group include Stac an Armin ('warrior's stack'), Stac Lee ('grey stack') and Stac Levenish ('stream' or 'torrent'). The island of Dùn ('fort'), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a galleon fleeing {{the defeat of the}} Spanish Armada, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), suggest that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.|$|E
