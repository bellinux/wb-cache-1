Other agricultural cultivators were of a lower status, such as tenants, wage laborers, and in rare cases slaves. Artisans and craftsmen had a legal <b>and</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> between that of owner-cultivator farmers and common merchants. State-registered merchants, who were forced by law to wear white-colored clothes and pay high commercial taxes, were considered by the gentry as social parasites with a contemptible status. These were often petty shopkeepers of urban marketplaces; merchants such as industrialists and itinerant traders working between a network of cities could avoid registering as merchants and were often wealthier and {{more powerful than the}} vast majority of government officials. Wealthy landowners, such as nobles and officials, often provided lodging for retainers who provided valuable work or duties, sometimes including fighting bandits or riding into battle. Unlike slaves, retainers could come and go from their master's home as they pleased. Medical physicians, pig breeders, and butchers had a fairly high social status, while occultist diviners, runners, and messengers had low status.|$|E

25|$|Israeli culture views higher {{education}} {{as the key}} to higher mobility <b>and</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> in Israeli society. For millennia medieval European antisemitism often forbade the Jews from owning land and farming, which limited their career choices for making a decent living. This forced many Jews to place a much higher premium on education allowing them to seek alternative career options that involved entrepreneurial and white-collar professional pursuits such as merchant trading, science, medicine, law, accountancy, and moneylending as these professions required higher levels of verbal, mathematical, and scientific literacy. The emphasis of education within Israeli society has its modern roots at least since the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement {{all the way to the}} roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation.

This cross-sectional study examined the intersections of maternal racial <b>status,</b> age, <b>and</b> neighborhood <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> in explaining these disparities in low birth weight outcomes across a statewide sample of adolescent mothers. Methods: Using data from the North Carolina State Center of Health Statistics for 2010 - 2011, birth cases for 16, 472 adolescents were geocoded by street address and linked to census-tract information from the 2010 United States Census. Multilevel models with interaction terms were used to identify significant associations between maternal racial <b>status,</b> age, <b>and</b> neighborhood <b>socioeconomic</b> <b>status</b> (as defined by census-tract median household income) and low birth weight outcomes across census tracts. Results: Significant racial differences were identified in which African-American adolescents had greater odds of low birth weight outcomes than Caucasian adolescents (OR= 1. 88, 95 % CI 1. 64, 2. 15).
