Using aerial photography, the extent of glacier covers for the two years were mapped at a scale of 1 : 50, 000. The first volumetric calculation of glacier loss was based on inventory criteria; the second a hyposgraphic curve method based on Young’s investigations in Mistaya Basin (1991) and the third stereo <b>air</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> and DEM comparisons using computer software. These methods were applied to the highly glacierized Hector Lake catchment within the Bow Valley and then extrapolated up to the whole basin above Banff. Reasonable agreement was achieved between the methods and the magnitude of glacier loss is estimated to be between 930 and 1400 m 3 x 106 w. e. for the entire 42 year period. The bulk glacier “wastage” estimate was divided into proportions using the Peyto Glacier mass balance record. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and a back-cast to 1952 was necessary. The mass balance model proposed by Letreguilly (1988) was considered inappropriate for this task due to it not adequately representing the observations of recession on Peyto for 1952 to 1965. A new model utilizing Banff maximum summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data was constructed. The proportions of seasonal wastage contributios to the river flow were estimated using a multiple regression model of monthly average temperature and precipitation with snow course data as the antecedent condition determinant. This model was used to predict the shape of the glacier (ice and firn) melt hydrograph from June to September. An estimate of the temporal variation of glacier recession inputs to the Bow River hydrograph at Lake Louise and Banff was facilitated by comparing known basin yields with the modelled “wastage” values. For 1952 to 1993 at Banff, the average annual wastage/basin yield ration is found to be around 2. 3 %; for 1965 to 1992 (years of available data) at Lake Louise the same ratio is 4. 5 %. For the extremely low flow year of 1970 these ratios increase to 12. 5 % and 16. 2 % respectively. The proportion of flow derived from glacier recession in August of this year is estimated to be around 53 % for Banff and 84 % for Lake Louise. It is thought that the basin scale extrapolation may lead to under-estimations of wastage but the mass balance back-cast is more likely to preferentially weight wastage contributions toward {{the latter part of the}} time series...|$|E
40|$|Mexico, {{like many}} other {{countries}} worldwide, faces an environmental crisis of enormous proportions. While in its urban dimension environmental problems are more {{similar to those of}} developed countries, in rural areas they are analogous to those prevailing in developing countries. In rural areas, which are largely devoted to food production based on traditional methods, environmental concerns are mainly related to phenomena such as deforestation and soil erosion, and not to chemical pollution or ozone-layer depletion, which are the primary concerns of the broad public. The future food production in these regions and the possibility of improving the life quality of their inhabitants depend on our understanding of these kinds of problems, and our capacity to confront them. An overview of the theoretical framework on environmental deterioration reveals a lack of definition of the concepts and terms related to this issue. Several terms, such as ''desertification'' and ''fragmentation,'' among others, are widely used by ecologists but are clearly not synonymous with environmental deterioration. A consequence of this vagueness is the lack of clear criteria to differentiate areas that are only moderately modified from those in which true deterioration has occurred. Also, unified methods to efficiently evaluate environmental deterioration in rural areas are lacking. We briefly present a case study in which environmental deterioration was evaluated in La Montana, an extremely poor and climatically and topographically heterogeneous rural region inhabited by indigenous people in southern Mexico. Three deterioration categories are recognized based on degree of human influence, proportion of vegetation cover, and soil erosion severity. Use of <b>air</b> <b>photogrammetry</b> supplemented with field surveys revealed that 13 % of La Montana is already damaged (i. e., lacking native vegetation and affected, perhaps irreversibly, by severe erosion), while 36 % is altered (i. e., where native vegetation is substantially modified, but productive activities are still possible). In turn, almost three quarters of the land in the latter category is at high risk of becoming damaged. An analysis of the patterns of land-use changes around selected villages for the period 1979 - 1992 showed local annual deforestation rates ranging between 1 and 17 %, depending upon climatic conditions. Based on the conceptual review and the analysis of the case study, we suggest that environmental deterioration comprises at least three clearly distinct dimensions: the abiotic setting, the biological attributes, and the social characteristics of the process. Finally, we define environmental deterioration as any modification of the environment that implies a reduction or loss of its physical and biological qualities, caused by natural phenomena or human activities, ultimately representing a decrease in the availability of ecosystem goods and services to human populations. The methods used to evaluate environmental deterioration at La Montana allowed us to separate modifications that cause deterioration from those that do not. This investigation, carried out in a relatively short time and with a minimum financial investment, yielded a satisfactory assessment {{of the state of the}} environment at the regional and community scales, recognizing early indicators of deterioration. This approach may be particularly useful in rural regions that share many characteristics with La Montana, such as critical environmental problems, extreme poverty, and insufficient background information about these issues...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} glacier fronts {{combines}} different geomatics measurement techniques as the classic survey using total station or theodolite, technical GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), using laser-scanner or using <b>photogrammetry</b> (<b>air</b> or ground). The measure by direct methods (classical surveying and GNSS) is useful and fast when accessibility to the glaciers fronts is easy, {{while it is}} practically impossible to realize, {{in the case of}} glacier fronts that end up in the sea (tide water glaciers). In this paper, a methodology that combines photogrammetric methods and other techniques for lifting the front of the glacier Johnsons, inaccessible is studied. The images obtained from the front, come from a non-metric digital camera; its georeferencing to a global coordinate system is performed by measuring points GNSS support in accessible areas of the glacier front side and applying methods of direct intersection in inaccessible points of the front, taking measurements with theodolite. The result of observations obtained were applied to study the temporal evolution (1957 - 2014) of the position of the Johnsons glacier front and the position of the Argentina, Las Palmas and Sally Rocks lobes front (Hurd glacier) ...|$|R
