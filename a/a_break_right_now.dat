50|$|The World Strongman Challenge (WMPC) {{first took}} place in 1987. It was a third major strongman {{competition}} with the previously established World's Strongest Man and World Muscle Power Classic having made the popularity of strongman competitions a huge success. The WSC in fact helped fill a void left in 1987 {{by the absence of}} the World's Strongest Man event and it may have even been introduced for these purpose. The event immediately attracted the very best athletes in the field and the final placings in that inaugural 1987 competition saw both Jón Páll Sigmarsson and Geoff Capes on the podium. In 1988, despite the reintroduction of WSM, the WSC continued and unlike many other strongman events of the era, the WSC managed to continue without <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>right</b> up until 1998, at no point dipping in the quality of the athletes competing.|$|R

40|$|Speech is {{structured}} into parts by syntactic and prosodic breaks. in locally syntactic ambiguous sentences, {{the detection of}} <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break</b> necessarily follows detection of <b>a</b> corresponding prosodic <b>break,</b> making <b>an</b> investigation of the immediate interplay of syntactic and prosodic information impossible when studying sentences in isolation. This problem can be solved, however, by embedding sentences in a discourse context that induces the expectation of either the presence or the absence of <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break</b> <b>right</b> at <b>a</b> prosodic <b>break.</b> Event-related potentials (ERPs) were compared to acoustically identical sentences in these different contexts. We found in two experiments that the closure positive shift, an ERP component known to be elicited by prosodic breaks, was reduced in size when <b>a</b> prosodic <b>break</b> was aligned with <b>a</b> syntactic <b>break.</b> These results establish that the brain matches prosodic information against syntactic information immediately...|$|R

Bobby Johnstone scored a second goal for Scotland on 46 minutes, and only poor finishing prevented Scotland from equalising. The home side continued to press forward, but were caught on <b>a</b> counter <b>break</b> <b>right</b> {{at the end of}} the match when Kocsis scored to make the final score 2-4 to Hungary. It was the closest any team had come to beating Hungary in a friendly competition since 1950. Afterwards, Puskas complimented the excellent work of Mackenzie, stating that he had [...] "never seen wing play of such a high standard".|$|R
5000|$|In {{broadcast}} programming, a hot switch or hotswitching {{is where}} the ending of one television show leads directly into {{the start of the}} show in the next time slot without <b>a</b> television commercial <b>break.</b> The concept is used to reduce the chances that people will switch to another TV network during the commercial break and allow the cold open of the new show to attract viewers; sometimes however, this will cause <b>a</b> commercial <b>break</b> <b>right</b> after the opening credits. It can also be called [...] "seamless" [...] broadcasting and is frequently used during television marathons and back-to-back airings of episodes of the same series. The technique is also used by many local network affiliates in the United States to seamlessly transition from a local newscast to a network newscast.|$|R
3000|$|... 23 Persons are {{assigned}} to the HOPE treatment group if they were born in Georgia and were age 18 in 1993 or later. Regression controls include dummies for year age 18, survey year, age, birth state, sex, race, and ethnicity. The control group includes persons born in states not adopting a merit aid program prior to 1998. We estimate the effects for 4 -year, 5 -year, and 6 -year policy windows; an X-Year Window means that cohorts included were age 18 X years {{before or after the}} policy was adopted. Including cohorts that are very far from the policy adoption weakens the identification since DD assumes <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>right</b> at policy adoption; using a 7 - or 8 -year window produces results similar to the 6 -year window. However, examining a less than 4 -year window is problematic because it yields few observations and focuses on treated observations in the very first post-HOPE cohorts. The 1993 and 1994 cohorts of entering freshmen were subject to an income cap for eligibility which reduced the percentage of Georgia students in these first cohorts who were affected by HOPE. Furthermore, focusing very close to the policy adoption exacerbates measurement error issues resulting from some students finishing high school at an age other than 18. Standard errors are clustered by year age 18, but significance levels are unchanged under several reasonable alternative inference procedures.|$|R

Soon after, Australian halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down the <b>right</b> before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try.

50|$|When {{thrown by}} a {{right-handed}} pitcher, <b>a</b> screwball <b>breaks</b> {{from left to}} right {{from the point of view}} of the pitcher; the pitch therefore moves down and in on a right-handed batter and down and away from a left-handed batter. When thrown by a left-handed pitcher, <b>a</b> screwball <b>breaks</b> from <b>right</b> to left, moving down and in on a left-handed batter and down and away from a right-handed batter. Due to this left-to-right movement of the ball (when thrown by a right-handed pitcher), right-handed pitchers use a screwball against left-handed batters in the same way that they use a slider against right-handed batters. If thrown correctly, the screwball breaks in the opposite direction of a curveball.|$|R

Norths made the semis again in 1998, with Seers making a mid-season change to centre and Ben Ikin playing at fullback. Seers played over a hundred games for the Bears, but after a period in rehab for a drug problem, signed with the Tigers for 2000.|$|R

50|$|Together with Joe Simpson, Yates climbed Siula Grande in 1985, via the {{hitherto}} unclimbed west face. On the descent, Simpson {{fell through}} <b>a</b> cornice, <b>breaking</b> his <b>right</b> leg and heel. To continue descending, Yates then used ropes to lower Simpson {{down the mountain}} in stages. While descending in the night in bad weather, Yates lowered Simpson over an unseen cliff edge, which meant that he was hanging over a deep crevasse with only Simpson's hold on the rope to prevent him falling. To avoid being pulled off the mountain himself, Yates cut the rope. Simpson thus fell approximately 50 feet into the crevasse. He survived the fall, unbeknown to Yates, who assumed {{he must have been}} killed. Simpson managed to climb out of the crevasse and reached base camp four days later.|$|R
50|$|Kyle and Tina {{decide to}} forget about the {{break-up}} and join in the game. Meanwhile, Lisa attempts to warn Larry and Connie of the piñata, but neither of them believe her and continue on their search. As they do so, they pick up a shovel, and get a bunch of underwear from a secret stash. The piñata picks up the shovel, and crushes Connie's head before turning on Larry. Lisa goes to the camp, and tells Paul and Monica about what she saw. The judges, unsure about whether they should believe her or not, go to look for Bob. While they do so, Jake and Julie see the piñata, and when Jake goes to open it, the piñata grabs him and rips out his testicles while it beats Julie to death. Paul is later killed, as Kyle and Tina reconcile. A new group of Kyle, Tina, Doug, Carmen, and Lisa now leave when they see Bob ripped in half on a tree. Doug is hanged by the piñata. As Carmen and Lisa go back, Lisa takes <b>a</b> bathroom <b>break</b> <b>right</b> before Carmen gets her head chopped off. Monica finds Kyle and Tina. Lisa makes it to the camp and thinks Larry and Connie are in there just before she is killed by the piñata. Kyle, Tina and Monica kill the piñata by blowing it up by a Molotov cocktail.|$|R

It was Barcelona who began the second half playing hard, physical football. After 57 minutes, Evaristo avoided the attentions of two opponents to score Barcelona's second. When Martínez' cross shot went in, the Yugoslavs reacted badly, trying to attack the linesman, and Lazar Tasić was sent off.

Thurston missed the subsequent kick after it hit the upright. Feldt then produced a kick off that forced a mistake from Broncos halfback Ben Hunt which gave the Cowboys the field position required for Thurston to kick the winning field goal to win the match 17-16.
