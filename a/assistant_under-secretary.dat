Abu Bakar was reportedly said to be increasingly reluctant to accept advice from the British-appointed state lawyers, and increasingly turned to his private lawyers which he had employed. Weld voiced his intent to place a Resident in Johor, which prompted Abu Bakar to make a trip to England in August 1884 to negotiate new terms with the British Colonial Office. The <b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> of the Colonial Office, Robert Meade, conceded to Abu Bakar's request for an absence of a British Resident in Johor, although Abu Bakar gave an in-principle acceptance for a British adviser in Johor (though none was appointed until 1914). An agreement was drawn up, and Abu Bakar was promised control over internal affairs in exchange for British control over foreign affairs pertaining to the state.|$|E

Notable individuals including Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, <b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> at External Affairs during the internment of Japanese Canadians. Ann Sunahara argues that Keenleyside was a sympathetic administrator that advocated strongly against the removal of Japanese Canadians from the BC coast. He, unsuccessfully, tried to remind other government officials {{of the distinction between}} Japanese foreign nationals and Canadian citizens in regards to personal and civil rights.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Kelly's murder, {{stories that}} the Ripper had {{drowned in the}} Thames began to circulate. In February 1891, the MP for West Dorset, Henry Richard Farquharson, {{announced}} that Jack the Ripper was [...] "the son of a surgeon" [...] who had committed suicide {{on the night of}} the last murder. Although Farquharson did not name his suspect, the description resembles Druitt. Farquharson lived [...] from the Druitt family and was part of the same social class. The Victorian journalist George R. Sims noted in his memoirs, The Mysteries of Modern London (1906): [...] " [...] body was found in the Thames after it had been in the river for about a month". Similar comments were made by Sir John Moylan, <b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> of the Home Office: [...] " [...] escaped justice by committing suicide at the end of 1888" [...] and Sir Basil Thomson, made Assistant Commissioner of the CID in 1913: [...] " [...] an insane Russian doctor [...] escaped arrest by committing suicide in the Thames at the end of 1888". Neither Moylan nor Thomson was involved in the Ripper investigation.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the trial}} of Jameson, Rhodes' solicitor, Bourchier Hawksley, refused to produce cablegrams that had passed between Rhodes and his agents in London during November and December 1895. According to Hawksley, these {{demonstrated}} that the Colonial Office 'influenced the actions of those in South Africa' who embarked on the Raid, and even that Chamberlain had transferred control of the Pitsani Strip to facilitate an invasion. Nine days before the Raid, Chamberlain had asked his <b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> to encourage Rhodes to [...] "hurry up" [...] because of the developing Venezuela Crisis of 1895.|$|E

Late in 1938, Newsam was selected as Principal Officer in the South Eastern Civil Defence region; this role meant that should war break out, he would be Chief of Staff to the Regional Commissioner.

He lunched with Grey and Sir Eyre Crowe (<b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> at the Foreign Office) on 9 August, urging them that Britain must mobilise {{on the same}} day as France and send the whole six divisions. He thought Grey “the most ignorant & careless of the two … an ignorant, vain & weak man quite unfit to be the Foreign Minister of any country larger than Portugal”. Wilson was perhaps unappreciative that Grey was not only trying to find a peaceful resolution but also had to consider the domestic political crisis as the Parliament Act was being pushed through and troops were being deployed against strikers in London, Liverpool and South Wales.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Abu Dhabi" [...] is uncertain. Meaning [...] "Father of the Gazelle", when {{literally}} translated from Arabic, it probably referred to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. According to Bilal al-Budoor, <b>assistant</b> <b>under-secretary</b> for Cultural Affairs at the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development, [...] "The area {{had a lot of}} dhibaa , and was nicknamed after that." [...] An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [...] and was named the [...] "father" [...] of the animal. Abu Dhabi's original name was Milh [...] "salt", possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient salt marshes that surround the city. Some Bedouins called the city Umm Dhabi (mother of deer), while British records refer to the place as Abu Dhabi. According to some historical accounts, the name Abu Dhabi was first used more than 300 years ago. The first word of Abu Dhabi is pronounced [...] "Bu" [...] by inhabitants on the city's western coast. In {{the eastern part of the}} city, the pronunciation is [...] "Abu".|$|E

2500|$|A staunch anti-Fascist, West {{attacked}} {{both the}} Conservative governments {{of her own}} country for appeasing Adolf Hitler and her colleagues on the left for their pacifism. Neither side, in her view, understood the evil Nazism posed. Unlike many on the left, she also distrusted Joseph Stalin. To West, Stalin had a criminal mentality that Communism facilitated. She was outraged when the Allies switched their loyalties in regards to Yugoslav resistance movements by deciding in 1943 to start backing the Communist-led Partisans led by Tito in Yugoslavia, thus abandoning their support of Draža Mihailović's Chetniks, whom she considered the legitimate Yugoslav resistance. She expressed her feelings and opinions on the Allies' switch in Yugoslavia by writing the satirical short story titled [...] "Madame Sara's Magic Crystal", but decided not to publish it upon discussion with Orme Sargent, <b>Assistant</b> <b>Under-Secretary</b> of State at the Foreign Office. Writing in her diary, West mentioned Sargent persuaded her that [...] "the recognition of Tito was made by reason of British military necessities, and for no other reason" [...] and following Sargent's claim, she described her decision not to publish the story {{as an expression of}} [...] "personal willingness to sacrifice myself to the needs of my country". After the war, West's anti-Communism hardened as she saw Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other Eastern and Central European states succumb to Soviet domination.|$|E
60|$|When October came no {{information}} from the Secretary of State's office had yet reached Folking, and the two inhabitants there were becoming almost despondent as well as impatient. There was nobody with whom they could communicate. Sir John Joram had been obliged to answer {{a letter from the}} squire by saying that, as soon as there was anything to tell the tidings would assuredly be communicated to him from the Home Office. The letter had seemed to be cold and almost uncivil; but Sir John had in truth said all that he could say. To raise hopes which, after all, might be fallacious, would have been, on his part, a great fault. Nor, in spite of his bet, was he very sanguine, sharing his friend Honybun's opinion as to Judge Bramber's obstinacy. And there was a correspondence between the elder Caldigate and the Home Office, in which the letters from the squire were long and well argued, whereas the replies, which always came by return of post, were short and altogether formal. Some <b>assistant</b> <b>under-secretary</b> would sign his name at the end of three lines, in which the correspondent was informed that as soon as the matter was settled the result would be communicated.|$|E

In December 1863 Sanderson accompanied Lord Wodehouse to Berlin and Copenhagen on his special mission during the Schleswig-Holstein crisis. Early in his career he crossed paths with Lord Stanley, later 15th Earl of Derby. Sanderson became Stanley's private secretary in July 1866 and left an impression on Stanley, who described him as 'the best of the juniors' on exit from office, after Benjamin Disraeli's first government fell in the 1868 December General Election. In 1871 he went to Geneva during the arbitration between the United Kingdom and the USA on the Alabama claims. He was later private secretary to Foreign Secretary Lord Granville between 1880 and 1885, Senior Clerk at the Foreign Office between 1885 and 1889, <b>Assistant</b> Permanent <b>Under-Secretary</b> of State for Foreign Affairs between 1889 and 1894 and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 1894 and 1906.
