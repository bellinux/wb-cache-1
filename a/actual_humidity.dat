40|$|Abstract>> It is {{important}} to accurately measure and control the relative humidity of humidified gas entering a PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) fuel cell stack because the level of humidification strongly affects the performance and durability of the stack. Humidity measurement devices {{can be used to}} directly measure the relative humidity, but they cost much to be equipped and occupy spaces in a fuel cell system. We present soft sensors for predicting the relative humidity without <b>actual</b> <b>humidity</b> measuring devices. By combining FIR (finite impulse response) model with PLS (partial least square) and SVM (support vector machine) regression models, DPLS (dynamic PLS) and DSVM (dynamic SVM) soft sensors were developed to correctly estimate the relative humidity of humidified gases exiting a planar-type membrane humidifier. The DSVM soft sensor showed a better prediction performance than the DPLS one because it is able to capture nonlinear correlations between the relative humidity and the input data of the soft sensors. Without <b>actual</b> <b>humidity</b> sensors, the soft sensors presented in this work can be used to monitor and control the humidity in operation of PEM fuel cell systems...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of the {{atmospheric}} distribution of water vapour is of key importance in weather prediction and climate research. It is tightly coupled to processes like energy transfer, precipitation, {{and is an}} important greenhouse gas. However, currently there is {{lack of knowledge about}} the <b>actual</b> <b>humidity</b> field, due both to a shortage of observations and a sub-optimal handling of humidity in the data assimilation systems, which are used to make estimates of the actual atmospheric field. Such fields are used to start numerical weather prediction models and for climate monitoring. Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are particularly sensitive to water vapour; observations from ground based GPS receivers can provide additional information related to {{the atmospheric}} content of humidity. The TOUGH project is to develop and refine methods enabling the optimal use of GPS data from existing European GPS stations in numerical weather prediction models and {{to assess the impact of}} such data upon the skill of weather forecasts.

40|$|Farming {{the soil}} can {{significantly}} influence quality of surface and ground water {{because it is}} carried out both on the soil and in the whole landscape, where the water within its hydrological cycle comes from. Water distribution in the soil can be significantly influenced by character of the land. This work describes soil properties which affects water retention and distribution, for example porosity, texture, soil structure and bulk density. All these factors determine soil cultivation that depends on its <b>actual</b> <b>humidity.</b> There are farming practices described, too. These practices can significantly influence water contents in the soil, soil humidity {{and the influence of}} surface water on soil erosion. Factors which influence water distribution within soils are sorted into individual chapters. They are soil, cultivation and its depresion, water erosion, edaphone water regime of soil and the influence of vegetation to water regime of soil. In the end of this work, we conclude that reduced and soil-protective technologies have positive influence on water regime, macroedaphone biomass content (higher number of earthworms), surface runoff reduction and therefore minimize a risk of soil water erosion and unfavorable soil compaction in comparison to conventional technologies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Ecological field {{research}} {{on the influence of}} meteorological parameters on a forest inhabiting species is confronted with the complex relations between measured data and the real conditions the species is exposed to. This study highlights this complexity for the example of Ixodes ricinus. This species lives mainly in forest habitats near the ground, but {{field research}} on impacts of meteorological conditions on population dynamics is often based on data from nearby official weather stations or occasional in situ measurements. In addition, studies use very different data approaches to analyze comparable research questions. This study is an extensive examination of the methodology used to analyze the impact of meteorological parameters on Ixodes ricinus and proposes a methodological approach that tackles the underlying complexity. Methods Our specifically developed measurement concept was implemented at 25 forest study sites across Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Meteorological weather stations recorded data in situ and continuously between summer 2012 and autumn 2015, including relative humidity measures in the litter layer and different heights above it (50  cm, 2  m). Hourly averages of relative humidity were calculated and compared with data from the nearest official weather station. Results Data measured directly in the forest can differ dramatically from conditions recorded at official weather stations. In general, data indicate a remarkable relative humidity decrease from inside to outside the forest and from ground to atmosphere. Relative humidity measured in the litter layer were, on average, 24 % higher than the official data and were much more balanced, especially in summer. Conclusions The results illustrate the need for, and benefit of, continuous in situ measurements to grasp the complex relative humidity conditions in forests. Data from official weather stations do not accurately represent <b>actual</b> <b>humidity</b> conditions in forest stands and the explanatory power of short period and fragmentary in situ measurements is extremely limited. However, it is still an open question to what kind of meteorological data are necessary to answer specific questions in tick research. The comparison of research findings was hindered by the variety of information provided, which is why we propose details for future reporting...|$|E

The {{object of}} this thesis is "To {{investigate}} the actual creep, shrinkage and elastic strains in a prestressed concrete bridge and to compare these {{with the results}} of creep and shrinkage tests carried out in the laboratory in accordance with ASTM C 512 Specification on concrete cylinders made using the same aggregates and mix proportions as used for the prestressed concrete bridge and also with the theoretical values calculated using the CEB-FIP recommendations. " A literature survey has been carried out to determine the present state of knowledge on the creep, shrinkage and elastic shortening of concrete structures and how this knowledge is used in design. Measurements of actual creep, shrinkage and elastic strain in concrete of the Brakwater South bridge near Windhoek have been recorded since its construction in 1978. At the same time in the laboratory concrete test cylinders and cubes were prepared using the same aggregates and mix proportions as used for the construction of the bridge. Some of the specimens were cured and tested in accordance with BS 1881 to determine the strength of the concrete and the Modulus of Elasticity. Other specimens were cured and stored at controlled temperature and humidity conditions in accordance with ASTM C 512 - 76 to determine the creep and shrinkage characteristics of the concrete under controlled laboratory conditions. Using the latest CEB-FIP and BS 5400 design codes the theoretical design values of creep, shrinkage and elastic shortening are calculated, based on <b>actual</b> temperature, <b>humidity</b> conditions prevailing at the site since the construction of the bridge. The values of creep, shrinkage and elastic shortening actually measured on site are compared with the theoretical design values based on small scale laboratory tests and tentative design recommendations applicable to local conditions are produced...|$|R

[1997]; Veste and Herppich [1995]). Gas exchange measurements were carried out with ambient CO 2 concentrations and the H 2 O and CO 2 concentrations were determined with an infra-red gas analyser (BINOS 100 - 4 P, Rosemount, Hanau, Germany). Each portion of leaf (couple of leaflets) {{was placed in the}} minicuvette for 5 – 6 minutes until a constant H 2 O signal was reached. Transpiration and CO 2 exchange were calculated according to Koch et al. ([1971]). Leaf conductance for water vapour (gH 2 O) was calculated using the method of von Caemmerer and Farquhar ([1981]), with software DIAGAS 2.0 (Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany), and all fluxes were calculated in relation to the projected leaf area. Each portion of leaf was scanned and its area measured by using the same digital image processing technique described in the previous section. During the measurements, the air temperature and relative humidity in the cuvette were kept constant and corresponded closely to the actual ambient VPD. Three days with different temperature and humidity conditions were selected: I) 20 °C, VPD 0.7 kPa, II) 25 °C, 1.4 kPa, and III) 32 °C, 2.3 kPa, that represented typical summer days in July and August, and the minicuvette was adjusted to these <b>actual</b> temperature and <b>humidity</b> conditions. The illumination was set to a constant value of 1100 μmol m− 2 s− 1 using an external halogen lamp to ensure the light-saturation of the photosynthesis.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{compacted}} bentonite {{has been}} proposed as the buffer material in the Swedish concept for the disposal of nuclear waste. To increase {{the knowledge of the}} hydro-mechanical behaviour of unsaturated swelling bentonite a series of laboratory experiments was carried out. The main purpose was to conceptually model the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the bentonite. The influence of testing techniques was also studied so that the laboratory tests could be properly evaluated. The investigated bentonite is a commercial bentonite, MX- 80, which is available from American Colloid Co. The focus of the laboratory program was to investigate the influence of confinement on the water retention properties, the development of swelling pressure during a decrease in suction and the effect of external pressure and swelling pressure on suction. The majority of the test types involved a stepwise increase in relative humidity under free swelling and under constant volume conditions with measurement of swelling pressure. In addition, tests with constant water content and externally applied pressure were performed. In those tests relative humidity was measured. The measurement of relative humidity through narrow channels was investigated and the influence of testing technique was investigated with regard to gradients in temperature and air pressure over the equipment. The results show that swelling pressure develops during water uptake from water in vapour phase when samples are tested under constant volume conditions. The results also show that if a pressure is applied to a sample with a constant water content the result will be an increase in the measured relative humidity and vice versa. Retention curves for absorption and desorption were determined under free swelling conditions at different relative humidity. The appearance of the retention curves was dependent on the initial water content. The results of the laboratory tests were used to find a relation between water content, void ratio, swelling pressure and suction. In the analysis of the test results the interpretation was made under the assumption that equilibrium had been reached. The measured axial swelling pressure that developed during water uptake under constant volume condition was normalised to a pressure corresponding to swelling pressure at saturation to be independent of void ratio. A relation between the normalised swelling pressure and the degree of saturation is suggested. A second relation based on a thermodynamic relationship for saturated conditions was compared to the laboratory results. In the second relation the swelling pressure is related to the <b>actual</b> relative <b>humidity</b> in the clay and the relative humidity according to the retention curve for the current water content. The correspondence between the second relation and the measured test results was found to be good. The analyses are mainly based on results from the tests conducted with an increasing degree of saturation under constant void ratio. Based on the mentioned relations a model is proposed which can be used e. g. to evaluate field measurements and model the late stage of the wetting process...|$|R
40|$|In ectothermic organisms, {{variation}} in body temperature directly affects {{factors such as}} rates of energy acquisition, growth, and reproduction (Shoemaker and McClanahan 1975; McClanahan 1978). Temperature also exerts a strong infl uence on ecological interactions such as predator–prey and host–pathogen interactions, and changes in temperature can completely reverse the outcome of such interactions at both the individual and population levels (Elliot et al. 2002; Woodhams et al. 2003). Although the body temperature of terrestrial ectotherms is broadly correlated with environmental temperature, the actual body temperatures of many species can differ considerably from macroenvironmental temperatures due to species-specifi c behavior, physiology, morphology, and microenvironment use. As a result, ectotherms exposed to identical macroenvironmental conditions can experience very different body temperatures (Kennedy 1997). The physiology and ecology of amphibians, and their thermal relations, are also strongly influenced by moisture. The degree of evaporative water loss (EWL) varies considerably within and among species (Shoemaker and Nagy 1977; Wygoda 1984; Buttemer et al. 1996; Young et al. 2005), and individuals of many species are able to adjust their rates of water loss over relatively {{short periods of time}} (Withers et al. 1982; Wygoda 1989 a; Withers 1995; Tracy et al. 2008). The moisture and thermal environments, and interactions between them, can constrain the performance of amphibians (Snyder and Hammerson 1993; Tracy et al. 1993). However, the <b>actual</b> temperature and <b>humidity</b> experienced by an amphibian can differ dramatically within a range of available macroenvironmental conditions, depending on microenvironment use (Schwarzkopf and Alford 1996; Seebacher and Alford 2002; Rowley and Alford 2007 a). To understand how the environment is experienced by amphibians in the field, both the thermal and moisture environments must be characterized as they are experienced by amphibians. Understanding the thermal and water relations of amphibians in the field is important not only for understanding their biology, but also for conservation. Recent declines in amphibian populations around the world have been attributed in part to the epidemic disease amphibian chytridiomycosis (Lips et al. 2006). Changes in thermoregulatory opportunities available to rainforest frogs may have contributed to their widespread declines in association with the disease (Pounds et al. 2006). Laboratory experiments have shown that elevated body temperatures, as can be produced by basking, can cure amphibians of the disease (Woodhams et al. 2003). Global warming is also likely to have a large impact on many species, with macroenvironmental modeling suggesting that the distributions of many ectothermic species will be dramatically altered (Thomas et al. 2004). This approach is limited {{by the fact that the}} present distributions of many species may not refl ect their fundamental climatic requirements (Parmesan et al. 2005). Understanding those requirements may aid in refi ning such predictions (Kennedy 1997; Parmesan et al. 2005) ...|$|R
40|$|The Multi-sensor Cloud Retrieval Simulator (MCRS) {{produces}} a “simulated radiance” product from any high-resolution general circulation model with interactive aerosol as if a specific sensor {{such as the}} Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were viewing {{a combination of the}} atmospheric column and land–ocean surface at a specific location. Previously the MCRS code only included contributions from atmosphere and clouds in its radiance calculations and did not incorporate properties of aerosols. In this paper we added a new aerosol properties module to the MCRS code that allows users to insert a mixture of up to 15 different aerosol species in any of 36 vertical layers. This new MCRS code is now known as MCARS (Multi-sensor Cloud and Aerosol Retrieval Simulator). Inclusion of an aerosol module into MCARS not only allows for extensive, tightly controlled testing of various aspects of satellite operational cloud and aerosol properties retrieval algorithms, but also provides a platform for comparing cloud and aerosol models against satellite measurements. This kind of two-way platform can improve the efficacy of model parameterizations of measured satellite radiances, allowing the assessment of model skill consistently with the retrieval algorithm. The MCARS code provides dynamic controls for appearance of cloud and aerosol layers. Thereby detailed quantitative studies of the impacts of various atmospheric components can be controlled. In this paper we illustrate the operation of MCARS by deriving simulated radiances from various data field output by the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS- 5) model. The model aerosol fields are prepared for translation to simulated radiance using the same model subgrid variability parameterizations as are used for cloud and atmospheric properties profiles, namely the ICA technique. After MCARS computes modeled sensor radiances equivalent to their observed counterparts, these radiances are presented as input to operational remote-sensing algorithms. Specifically, the MCARS-computed radiances are input into the processing chain used to produce the MODIS Data Collection 6 aerosol product (M{O/Y}D 04). The M{O/Y}D 04 product is of course normally produced from M{O/Y}D 021 KM MODIS Level- 1 B radiance product directly acquired by the MODIS instrument. MCARS matches the format and metadata of a M{O/Y}D 021 KM product. The resulting MCARS output can be directly provided to MODAPS (MODIS Adaptive Processing System) as input to various operational atmospheric retrieval algorithms. Thus the operational algorithms can be tested directly without needing to make any software changes to accommodate an alternative input source. We show direct application of this synthetic product in analysis of the performance of the MOD 04 operational algorithm. We use biomass-burning case studies over Amazonia employed in a recent Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE) -sponsored study of aerosol impacts on numerical weather prediction (Freitas et al., 2015). We demonstrate that a known low bias in retrieved MODIS aerosol optical depth appears to be due to a disconnect between <b>actual</b> column relative <b>humidity</b> and the value assumed by the MODIS aerosol product...|$|R
