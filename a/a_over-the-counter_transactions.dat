25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either <b>an</b> <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>transaction</b> or on <b>an</b> options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock, being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|R
40|$|The credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) on <b>an</b> <b>over-the-counter</b> derivative <b>transaction</b> is {{the price}} of the risk associated with the potential default of the counterparties to the trade. This dissertation provides an introduction to the concept of CVA, beginning with the required backdrop of counterparty risk and the basics of default risk modelling. Right and wrong way risks are central themes of the dissertation. A model for the pricing of both the unilateral and the bilateral CVA on a credit default swap (CDS) is implemented. Each step of this process is explained thoroughly. Results are reported and discussed for a range of parameters. The trends observed in the CDS CVA numbers produced by the model are all justified and the right and wrong way nature of the exposures captured. In addition, the convergence and stability of the numerical schemes utilised are shown to be appropriate. A case study, in which the model is applied to a set of market scenarios, concludes the dissertation. Since the field is far from established, a number of areas are suggested for further research.

40|$|Disputes {{over the}} "mis-selling" of {{over-the-counter}} derivatives {{took place in}} countries with sophisticated financial market from 1990 s, but the recent global financial crisis revealed the problem of "mis-selling" of over-the-counter derivatives wide-spread in many jurisdictions. This thesis addresses three research questions. The first research question is why <b>transactions</b> of <b>over-the-counter</b> derivatives are prone to "mis-selling" practices. The thesis explains that the vulnerability of over-the-counter derivatives to "mis-selling" is caused by dependence of consumers on financial institutions due to asymmetric information and knowledge, high profitability of selling over-the-counter derivatives and the expanding products and consumer base of over-the-counter derivatives. The second question is how social institutions such as statutory regulation and private law have dealt with "mis-selling" of over-the-counter derivatives. The thesis shows that statutory regulation demands that financial institutions assume fiduciary duties which cannot be denied or modified by contracts while private law sees <b>an</b> <b>over-the-counter</b> derivative <b>transaction</b> as {{just one of the}} commercial contracts between equal counterparties. It also explains the difference of the two institutions in testing causality between breach of standards and loss. The third research question is how to achieve harmonized interplay between private law and statutory regulation in regulating "mis-selling" of over-the-counter derivatives. The thesis proposes two legal reforms; the statutory "right of action" for breach of regulatory requirements should be extended to all consumers except for financial institutions; the causation test in private law should be relaxed to the 'significance' test...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholders {{promoting}} {{landfill gas}} (LFG) energy projects are identifying new funding incentives to implement LFG energy (LFGE) projects. This presentation focuses on how landfills {{are participating in}} voluntary carbon and renewable energy markets, and presents case studies from award-winning projects that utilize these funding mechanisms. Landfills participate in the voluntary carbon markets using one of two main mechanisms: on an exchange or through <b>an</b> <b>over-the-counter</b> (OTC) <b>transaction.</b> An exchange, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), is likely the most well known mechanism. At present, CCX has 35 registered landfill methane offset project providers in the United States [1]. As of April 2008, landfill methane projects comprised approximately 9 {{percent of all the}} carbon credits issued by CCX. OTC transactions are private between the seller, buyer, and/or broker involved in the transaction. Despite their private nature, the volume of OTC traded emissions has substantially grown in recent years according to research from Ecosystem Marketplace [2]. Recent data from Point Carbon indicate that 132 U. S. landfills have either made a transaction in the carbon market, or {{are in the process of}} developing, producing, certifying, or verifying their emissions reductions in order to prepare for an OTC transaction or exchange on the CCX [3]. In addition to carbon finance, LFGE projects generating electricity are also selling Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). These RECs are then purchased by companies wishing to reduce their environmental footprint or used by utilities to comply with various renewable portfolio standards. Stakeholders are also using state and federal financial incentives to promote LFGE projects. In 2008, the IRS awarded 45 applicants the authority to issue Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (CREBs) to support LFGE projects [4]. Several other new financial incentives were funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) including the Energ...|$|R

We build a model where an agent buying some {{units of the}} asset can offer to sell part of them to an OTC partner. Intermediation chains are endogenously formed and impact the asset's market liquidity, its issuance, and who ultimately holds the asset. An increase in the intermediaries' funding liquidity (e. g. a lower haircut on the asset) makes intermediation less necessary but also makes it cheaper to issue the asset, increasing the total volume to be distributed {{and the number of}} intermediaries and agents holding the asset. We derive implications on liquidity in OTC markets, the dissemination of ''toxic" assets and the collateral policy of central banks and CCPs...|$|R
