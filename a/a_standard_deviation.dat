5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years with <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who died}} of {{multiple}} organ failure additionally exhibited signs of skin hemorrhaging and necrosis, though both are otherwise rare. The two likely reasons for skin hemorrhaging and necrosis are an inability to effectively neutralize the venom, or unusually potent venom toxicity for that set of stings. In either case, these stings lead to multiple organ injury. While not everyone displayed lesions or necrosis, a strong correlation existed {{between the number of}} stings and the severity of injury.

40|$|Risk {{tolerance}} is a {{term used}} differently in psychology and economics. In psychology, personality is known to affect type of risk taking; instrumental and stimulating. In economics, financial risk tolerance {{is known to be}} affected by gender, income, and age. Personality may also affect financial risk tolerance. This paper explores the relationship between personality and financial risk tolerance using the Big Five Inventory and BIS- 11 test to measure personality and a multiple price list to measure financial risk tolerance. Additionally, this paper examines the relationship between the economic and psychological definitions of risk tolerance using the Stimulating and Instrumental Risk Questionnaire to measure the psychological interpretation. Results indicate personality does in fact affect financial risk tolerance and type of risk taking; <b>a</b> 3. 115 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> increase in agreeableness is associated with about <b>a</b> 0. 934 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> decrease in financial risk tolerance, <b>a</b> 0. 150 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> increase in impulsiveness is associated with approximately <b>a</b> 0. 040 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> decrease in instrumental risk taking, and <b>a</b> 2. 973 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> increase in conscientiousness is associated with roughly <b>a</b> 1. 216 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> decrease in stimulating risk taking.

There is limited evidence on the costs of corneal cross-linking, a cost-effectiveness study estimated the costs of the total treatment for one person as £928 ($1,392 U.S.) in the UK National Health Service, but this may be as high as $2,500 per eye in other countries.

25|$|For example, each of {{the three}} populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their {{standard}} deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7. It will have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters.

25|$|The first {{administration}} of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it {{was known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of definitions, arithmetic, classification, artificial language, antonyms, number series, analogies, logical inference, and paragraph reading. It was administered to over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to Yale University and Smith College. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} make cross-year score {{comparisons}} possible, in April 1941 the SAT verbal section was scaled to a mean of 500, and <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 100, and the June 1941 SAT verbal section was equated (linked) to the April 1941 test.

25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|For example, assume an {{investor}} {{had to choose}} between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with <b>a</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, {{an investor}} may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B's additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).|$|E

30|$|I {{find that}} the {{time-varying}} family environment {{plays an important role}} in student time use and test scores. <b>A</b> one <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> move in the distribution of family innovation parameters is associated with <b>a</b> 0.17 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> change in math score and <b>a</b> 0.19 <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> change in reading score. These results indicate that the time-dependent family environment is more important than teacher assignment for student achievement. For example, recent estimates from Chetty et al. (2014) show that <b>a</b> one <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> change in teacher quality moves math scores by 0.14 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> and English scores by 0.1 <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b> 5 The time use results imply that <b>a</b> one <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> increase in the distribution of family innovations increases homework time by 18 h, free reading time by 28 h, and TV watching by 102 h over the course of the school year. These changes are 20 – 22 % of the average time use for each activity. The results vary by the characteristics of the sibling pair, and they are robust to models that allow different students to be on different learning trajectories. When I analyze the correlations between family innovations for different outcomes, I find that family innovations to achievement are most strongly (and positively) related to family innovations to educational uses of time (i.e., homework and free reading). However, these correlations vary by the socioeconomic status of the family. The results suggest that programs targeted to increase education-related time inputs at home could produce gains to student achievement, especially among low-SES students.|$|R
