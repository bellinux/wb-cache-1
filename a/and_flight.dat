5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The fatal injury rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the fatal injury rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> engineers but did note that they had a high fatal injury rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> engineers in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led to widespread changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation by shooting down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
