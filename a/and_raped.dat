40|$|This thesis explores factors, influences, <b>and</b> {{causes of}} <b>rape</b> through social constructivist and feminist lenses, and makes {{recommendations}} for improving sex education to address <b>and</b> challenge <b>rape</b> myths <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture in general.

I review the literature related to <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture in order to identify factors and influences contributing to rape-supportive beliefs and behaviours in society at large, including the ways in which women's lives are impacted by the constant threat of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> how male socialization contributes to and normalizes this threat. Based on discourse and content analyses of online comments on articles related to <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture, <b>and</b> with reference to Ontario's most recent Health and Physical Education curriculum documents for grades 9 and 10 (Ontario Ministry of Education and Training, 1999), I make specific recommendations for how to better-educate boys and men about their roles and responsibilities in ending <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> mitigating <b>rape</b> culture...|$|R

5|$|Adams wrote {{numerous}} {{letters and}} essays {{in opposition to}} the occupation, which he considered a violation of the 1689 Bill of Rights. The occupation was publicized throughout the colonies in the Journal of Occurrences, an unsigned series of newspaper articles that may have been written by Adams in collaboration with others. The Journal presented what it claimed to be a factual daily account of events in Boston during the military occupation, an innovative approach in an era without professional newspaper reporters. It depicted a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers who assaulted men <b>and</b> <b>raped</b> women with regularity and impunity, drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians. The Journal ceased publication on August 1, 1769, which was a day of celebration in Boston: Governor Bernard had left Massachusetts, never to return.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. When {{she said she was}} drugged <b>and</b> <b>raped</b> in a hotel in 1999, controversy over the truth of the allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E

According to Marguerite de Carrouges' testimony, a squire in Le Gris' employ named Adam Louvel had {{knocked on the door}} of the chateau and demanded entry. All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges, who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business, and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called. Once inside, Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her. Although Marguerite protested, Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her, offering money in exchange. When Marguerite refused, Le Gris attempted to take her by force <b>and</b> <b>raped</b> her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years in particular, intra-military sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> in the U. S. armed forces have been the focus of {{frequent}} media attention and intense congressional debate. Despite reforms, the rate of intra-military sexual crimes continues to remain high, as does soldiers’ wariness to report instances of sexual violence to military commanders. These problems and others have invigorated the position taken by some that outside judicial review of intra- military sexual crimes is necessary to provide justice to victims and lower the rate of intra-military sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape.</b> This Note argues that one of the primary contributors to intra-military sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> is the gendered nature of the military itself. Given the nature of these acts, intra-military sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> can be properly qualified as “gender crimes. ” This Note also points out that this problem is not unique to the United States, as other militaries around the world struggle with intra-military sexual violence. Due to this widespread occurrence and international human rights laws prohibiting <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> gender-based violence more generally, this Note argues that intra-military sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> should be viewed as international gender crimes in violation of international customary law. It is theorized that recognizing intramilitary sexual assault <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> in this manner can bring greater attention to these crimes and help push for independent judicial review of intra-military sexual crimes on the domestic level worldwide...|$|R
