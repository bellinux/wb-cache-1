30|$|After {{selecting}} the aircraft, DALP-TS removes the pallet from the “storage aircraft” and assigns {{it to the}} first available position in the aircraft. If the aircraft’s trip is in state 1, no changes to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> date or solution object are necessary; however, updates are required for states 2 or 3. First, DALP-TS increments the number of flights flown in the solution object. DALP-TS also updates the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>departure</b> date and arrival date to reflect the new temporal constraints. DALP-TS sets the aircraft arrival date identical to the pallet latest arrival date and adjusts the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>departure</b> date to incorporate travel time; this also causes the insertion of an additional aircraft trip in the solution object. The ready to load date of this trip incorporates the previous trip’s departure date and total travel time. For this trip, the aircraft is empty but available for future loading. If the initial solution generator is in state 3, the aircraft is being used for the first time; the <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> date is updated such that the aircraft arrival date corresponds with the pallet’s earliest arrival date.|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} link in {{the overnight}} package business is the on-time arrival of trucks at airport terminals. Truck delays can delay the package sorting and transfer process, which can in turn delay <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> from the local terminal, as well as <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> from hub terminals that depend on timely aircraft arrivals. This paper models the airport terminal as a queueing process with random bulk arrivals. Predictions are provided for expectation, and standard deviation, of arrived work. From these predictions performance measures are developed for sort end-time and sort starvation. Particular attention is given to scheduling the start time for the sorting process, to balance a trade- off between maximizing sort productivity and minimizing the end time of the sort. The methods are being implemented as a web-based scheduling tool.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of taxi-out times at airports {{has the potential}} to substantially reduce delays and fuel consumption on the airport surface, and to improve the air quality in surrounding communities. The taxiway and runway systems at an airport determine its maximum possible departure throughput, or the number of <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> that it can handle per unit time. Current air traffic control procedures allow aircraft to push from their gates and enter the taxiway system as soon as they are ready. As this pushback rate approaches the maximum departure throughput of the airport, runway queues grow longer and surface congestion increases, resulting in increased taxi-out times...|$|E
30|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ready to}} load date is the earliest date upon which an aircraft can be loaded and depart the APOE. After selecting a pallet cargo load, DALP-TS computes an appropriate <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> date from the APOE that considers pallet available to load date. The aircraft arrival date describes the date upon which the aircraft arrives at the APOD, incorporating the departure date and the required travel time from APOE to APOD. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> date can {{be the same as}} the {{ready to load}} date; however, delaying the departure date to a later date may prevent or reduce the amount of pallet temporal violations. The ready to load date for each aircraft’s first trip is day 1. The ready to load date of each subsequent trip for a particular aircraft considers the previous trip’s departure date and the travel, down, and return time.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{strategy}} for planning <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> trajectories for a given airport is presented. Noise annoyance produced by overflying aircraft is modelled by using fuzzy logic in function of the received noise level during the trajectory, the type and specific sensibility of the areas being overflyed {{and the time of}} the day when the <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> takes place. Hence, an annoyance figure is obtained at different locations {{in the vicinity of the}} airport in function of a given trajectory. A non-linear multi-objective optimal control problem is presented in order to minimize the annoyance at all different locations and an optimal departure trajectory is obtained. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using a lexicographic technique where a hierarchical order among the optimization objectives is established in function of the perceived annoyance at each different location. Finally a practical example is given where an optimal departure trajectory is obtained while minimizing the noise nuisance at some residential zones, hospitals, schools and industrial zones.

40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of domestic and local airline indirect costs was carried out to formulate cost estimating equations for airline indirect costs. Data from CAB and FAA sources covering the years 1962 - 66 was used, and the costs were broken down into the classification of the uniform system of accounts Form 41, used by the airlines in reporting to the CAB. Thus regression equations were found for 1) annual system expenses in the categories such as Passenger Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Promotion and Sales, General and Administrative, etc. {{as well as an}} overall indirect operating cost; and 2) annual station expenses where the Aircraft and Traffic Servicing expenses for individual stations are examined. A stepwise regression technique is used to select the best combinations of independent variables for the equations. The independent variables were data such as revenue passenger miles, passengers enplaned, revenue aircraft miles, total revenue <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures,</b> etc. The results generally showed that a high degree of correlation could be found between the costs and some combination of these variables.

40|$|Common {{engineering}} {{models for}} aircraft noise, such as INM, yield noise levels by interpolation of Noise Power Distance (NPD) tables. In the European project Imagine (2004 - 2006), {{a different approach}} was proposed: the source is characterized by an emission spectrum and the received noise spectrum is calculated by subtracting the propagation attenuation spectrum from this emission spectrum. This is the usual approach for noise mapping of most noise sources. The aircraft emission spectrum {{is a function of}} (downward) emission direction, so each aircraft is represented by a hemisphere of emission spectra. This has been described by Bütikofer in Acta Acustica 93 (2007). As hemisphere emission data are not yet available for all aircraft types, a 'reverse engineering' scheme was developed within Imagine to derive first order estimates of hemispheres from NPD tables. To gain experience with this approach, we have performed an experiment near Amsterdam airport. Various types of data were collected for a set of <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures,</b> including noise data at twelve positions and flight data. The Imagine approach was used to calculate noise contours, and noise spectra at the twelve positions. The differences between measured and calculated spectra may be used as a basis for improving the first order estimates of the hemispheres...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{forecasting}} is estimating the time of some future event. Traditionally, forecasts are designed to minimize an error cost function that is evaluated once, possibly when the event occurs and forecast accuracy can be determined. However, in many applications forecast error costs accumulate over time, and the forecasts themselves may be updated with information that is collected as the expected time of the event approaches. This paper examines one such application, in which flow control managers in the U. S. air traffic system depend on forecasts of <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> times to predict and alleviate potential congestion. These forecasts are periodically updated until take-off occurs, {{although the number of}} updates may be limited by the cost of collecting, processing, and distributing information. The procedures developed in this paper balance the costs of accumulated forecast errors and the costs of forecast updates. The procedures are applied to the <b>aircraft</b> <b>departure</b> forecasting problem and are compared with methods currently used by the air traffic management system. Numerical examples demonstrate that the procedures increase forecast accuracy while reducing the costs associated with frequent forecast updates.

40|$|Development of {{improved}} modeling methods to provide increased fidelity of flight predictions for aircraft motions during flight in flow regimes with large nonlinearities requires improvements in test techniques for measuring and characterizing wind tunnel data. This paper presents {{a method for}} providing a measure of data integrity for static and forced oscillation test techniques. Data integrity is particularly important when attempting to accurately model and predict flight of today s high performance aircraft which are operating in expanded flight envelopes, often maneuvering at high angular rates at high angles-of-attack, even above maximum lift. Current aerodynamic models are inadequate in predicting flight characteristics in the expanded envelope, such as rapid <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> and other unusual motions. Present wind tunnel test methods do not factor changes of flow physics into data acquisition schemes, so in many cases data are obtained over more iterations than required, or insufficient data may be obtained to determine a valid estimate with statistical significance. Additionally, forced oscillation test techniques, {{one of the primary}} tools used to develop dynamic models, do not currently provide estimates of the uncertainty of the results during an oscillation cycle.

40|$|In crew scheduling, {{the aim of}} unit crewing is to keep {{crew members}} from {{different}} crew ranks together to operate a sequence of flights as a unit as much as possible. When the crew members of different ranks operate together for a sequence of flights, the sequence is unit crewed. A unit crewed solution {{is considered to be}} more robust in the sense that <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> {{are less likely to be}} delayed due to waiting for a member of a crew. It is usual to solve the ToD planning problem for each crew rank as a separate problem. To maximize unit crewing in the Tour-of-Duty (ToD) solution, a set of ToDs for one rank in terms of minimal cost is constructed and a weighted sum method is used to penalize any tour for the other rank that does not contain the same flight sequence. We believe that a model that solves the two ToD planning problems simultaneously can improve the number of unit crewing sequences without increasing the total crew cost. We use the number of unit crewed flight as a second objective and a branch and bound strategy to ensure that as many unit crewing sequences can be selected a...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{recent advances}} {{in the application of}} multiagent coordination algorithms to air traffic flow management. Indeed, air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. This problem is particularly complex as it requires the integration and/or coordination of many factors including: new data (e. g., changing weather info), potentially conflicting priorities (e. g., different airlines), limited resources (e. g., air traffic controllers) and very heavy traffic volume (e. g., over 40, 000 flights over the US airspace). The multiagent approach assigns an agent to a navigational fix (a specific location in 2 D space) and uses three separate actions to control the airspace: setting the separation between airplanes, setting ground holds that delay <b>aircraft</b> <b>departures</b> and rerouting aircraft. Agents then use reinforcement learning to learn the best set of actions. Results based on FACET (a commercial simulator) show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 80 % over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 85 % over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation). These results show that with proper selection of agents, their actions and their reward structures, multiagent coordination algorithms can be successfully applied to complex real world domains...|$|E
