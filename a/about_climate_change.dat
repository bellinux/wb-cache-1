5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} {{an active}} climate protection policy and {{was instrumental in}} the passing of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and in founding the Hadley Centre for Climate Research and Prediction. She helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, and in 1989 she called for a global treaty on climate change. Her speeches included one to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN General Assembly in November 1989. However, following her retirement as Prime Minister in 1990, she became sceptical <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> policy and rejected climate alarmism.|$|E
5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as {{if they are going to}} do something <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts <b>about</b> <b>climate</b> <b>change,</b> celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E
