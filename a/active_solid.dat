6000|$|Then {{there is}} yet one last and most {{important}} bearing of this yeast question. There is one direction probably in which {{the effects of the}} careful study of the nature of fermentation will yield results more practically valuable to mankind than any other. Let me recall to your minds the fact which I stated {{at the beginning of this}} lecture. Suppose that I had here a solution of pure sugar with a little mineral matter in it; and suppose it were possible for me to take upon the point of a needle one single, solitary yeast cell, measuring no more perhaps than the three-thousandth of an inch in diameter--not bigger than one of those little coloured specks of matter in my own blood at this moment, the weight of which it would be difficult to express in the fraction of a grain--and put it into this solution. From that single one, if the solution were kept at a fair temperature in a warm summer's day, there would be generated, in the course of a week, enough torulae to form a scum at the top and to form lees at the bottom, and to change the perfectly tasteless and entirely harmless fluid, syrup, into a solution impregnated with the poisonous gas carbonic acid, impregnated with the poisonous substance alcohol; and that, in virtue of the changes worked upon the sugar by the vital activity of these infinitesimally small plants. Now you see that this is a case of infection. And from the time that the phenomenon of fermentation were first carefully studied, it has constantly been suggested to the minds of thoughtful physicians that there was a something astoundingly similar between this phenomena of the propagation of fermentation by infection and contagion, and the phenomena of the propagation of diseases by infection and contagion. Out of this suggestion has grown that remarkable theory of many diseases which has been called the [...] "germ theory of disease," [...] the idea, in fact, that we owe a great many diseases to particles having a certain life of their own, and which are capable of being transmitted from one living being to another, exactly as the yeast plant is capable of being transmitted from one tumbler of saccharine substance to another. And that is a perfectly tenable hypothesis, one which in the present state of medicine ought to be absolutely exhausted and shown not to be true, until we take to others which have less analogy in their favour. And there are some diseases most assuredly in which it turns out to be perfectly correct. There are some forms of what are called malignant carbuncle which have been shown to be actually effected by a sort of fermentation, if I may use the phrase, by a sort of disturbance and destruction of the fluids of the animal body, set up by minute organisms which are the cause of this destruction and of this disturbance; and only recently the study of the phenomena which accompany vaccination has thrown an immense light in this direction, tending to show by experiments of the same general character as that to which I referred as performed by Helmholz, that there is a most astonishing analogy between the contagion of that healing disease and the contagion of destructive diseases. For it has been made out quite clearly, by investigations carried on in France and in this country, that the only part of the vaccine matter which is contagious, which is capable of carrying on its influence in the organism of the child who is vaccinated, is the solid particles and not the fluid. By experiments of the most ingenious kind, the solid parts have been separated from the fluid parts, and it has then been discovered that you may vaccinate a child as much as you like with the fluid parts, but no effect takes place, though an excessively small portion of the solid particles, the most minute that can be separated, is amply sufficient to give rise to all the phenomena of the cow pock, by a process which we can compare to nothing but the transmission of fermentation from one vessel into another, by the transport to the one of the torula particles which exist in the other. And it has been shown to be true of some of the most destructive diseases which infect animals, such diseases as the sheep pox, such diseases as that most terrible and destructive disorder of horses, glanders, that in these, also, the active power is the living solid particle, and that the inert part is the fluid. However, do not suppose that I am pushing the analogy too far. I do not mean to say that the <b>active,</b> <b>solid</b> parts in these diseased matters are of the same nature as living yeast plants; but, so far as it goes, there is a most surprising analogy between the two; and the value of the analogy is this, that by following it out we may some time or other come to understand how these diseases are propagated, just as we understand, now, about fermentation; and that, in this way, some of the greatest scourges which afflict the human race may be, if not prevented, at least largely alleviated.|$|E

The higher stability dispersion (> 40 days) was Co-Ni/ ethanol, Co-Ni/ 2 -methoxyethanol and Co-Ni/ 2 -propanol (< 10 days). The electrophoresis showed that particles are positively charged for the alcohols (62 mV for ethanol and 1. 4 x 10 - 3 mV for 2 -propanol) and 9. 64 mV negatively charged for 2 -methoxyethanol. The particles size of the bimetal colloids ranges from 5. 7 to 9. 8 nm. The <b>active</b> <b>solids</b> were obtained by solvent evaporation from the colloids dispersion.

DMC solutions of soybean oil, utilised as test lipid material, were pyrolysed in the presence of few milligrams of <b>active</b> <b>solids</b> under off-line and on-line (Py-GC-MS) conditions. While the yields of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) determined by off-line pyrolysis were negligible with undoped MCM- 41, those of Ti-MCM- 41 increased with increasing Ti content from 3. 5 % (at Ti/Si molar ratio 1 / 28) to 17 % at Ti/Si molar ratio 1 / 9 becoming comparable to those of titanium silicate nanopowders (13 %). Titania nanoparticles enriched in rutile or anatase were the most <b>active</b> <b>solids</b> (19 – 26 %), while coarse TiO 2 (NIST) was poorly active (0. 7 %). The best performing Ti-MCM- 41 was more effective than nanopowder titanium silicate for profiling FAMEs by on-line Py-GC-MS, but caused a larger double bond isomerisation of linoleic acid with respect to TiO 2 nanopowders. Although the accuracy of pyrolysis/methylation with DMC and Ti-MCM- 41 was inferior to standard methods, the method is appealing in the field of green analytical chemistry for being essentially a simple one-step procedure utilising small quantity of non-toxic and non-corrosive reagents.

A comparison between the commercial products and our preparations made evident a different particle size and phase composition. Moreover, in order to investigate a possible synergism between TiO 2 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), further two samples were purposely synthesized by adding to the reaction mixture used for the catalyst preparation {{a small amount of}} single-walled or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs).

In this work {{we present a}} Finite Volume discretization of electrochemical diffusive processes occurring during the operation of Li-Ion batteries. The system of equations is a nonlinear, time-dependent diffusive system, coupling the Li concentration and the electric potential. The system is formulated at length-scale at which {{two different types of}} domains are distinguished, one for the electrolyte and one for the <b>active</b> <b>solid</b> particles in the electrode. The domains can be of highly irregular shape, with electrolyte occupying the pore space of a porous electrode.

Their results indicate a great sensitivity of ROA for the elucidation of such compounds, even in case of structurally very similar geometrical isomers, and the differentiation of several types of chirality.
