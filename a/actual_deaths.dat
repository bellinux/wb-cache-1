As of 2009, the New York Times reported that at least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners had been killed amidst the persecution campaign; Falun Gong sources documented over 3,700 named death cases by 2013.

25|$|German {{government}} {{figures of}} war losses {{do not include}} the increase in natural deaths with war casualties. The German economist Bruno Gleitze from the German Institute for Economic Research estimated that there were 1,200,000 excess deaths caused by the harsh conditions in Germany during and after the war. Gleitze estimated 400,000 excess deaths during the war and 800,000 in post war Germany The West German Statistisches Bundesamt put the <b>actual</b> <b>deaths</b> from 1939-46 due to natural causes at 7,130,000 persons, the demographic study by Peter Marschalck estimated the expected deaths in peacetime due to natural causes of 5,900,000 persons, a difference of 1,230,000 excess deaths. In Allied-occupied Germany the shortage of food was an acute problem in 1946–47. The average kilocalorie intake per day was only 1,600 to 1,800, an amount insufficient for long-term health.|$|E

2500|$|The October 2010 Iraq War {{documents}} leak shed {{new light}} on the events of February–March 2006.

2500|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} energy argue that nuclear power is a clean and {{sustainable}} energy source which provides huge amounts of uninterrupted energy without polluting the air or emitting the carbon emissions that cause Global warming. Use of nuclear power provides plentiful, well-paying jobs, energy security, reduces a dependence on imported fuels and exposure to price risks associated with resource speculation and Middle East politics. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, {{in contrast to the}} massive amount of pollution and carbon emission generated from burning Fossil fuel like coal, oil and natural gas. Modern society demands always-on energy to power communications, computer networks, transportation, industry and residences at all times of day and night. In the absence of nuclear power, utilities need to burn fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable, even with access to solar and wind energy, because those sources are intermittent. [...] Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course for a country to achieve energy independence while also meeting their [...] "ambitious" [...] NDC's (nationally determined contributions) to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement signed by 195 nations. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and existing stockpiles can be reduced by using this waste to produce fuels for the latest technology in newer reactors. Finally, even though alarmist media reports of nuclear accidents raised fear levels a lot, in fact the Chernobyl disaster caused 56 direct deaths and Fukushima reactors caused no <b>actual</b> <b>deaths</b> {{as a result of the}} nuclear meltdown. The operational safety record of nuclear is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants and by preventing pollution, actually saves lives every year.|$|E

5000|$|The major {{difference}} between the novel and the anime is the significantly darker tone in the novels.

5000|$|The second {{mechanical}} {{method by which}} violence is discouraged is simply the deadliness of combat in the game. Whilst Story Points act as a buffer helping prevent the <b>actual</b> <b>deaths</b> of a character, combat in the Doctor Who game tends to be swift and brutal, with many alien weapons simply doing [...] "Lethal" [...] damage, rather than a damage number. Characters that seek violent solutions to problems are at grave risk of injury, with damage being removed directly from character attributes.|$|E
50|$|Other biases might {{underlie}} the zero-risk bias. One {{is a tendency}} {{to think in terms of}} proportions rather than differences. A greater reduction in proportion of deaths is valued higher than a greater reduction in <b>actual</b> <b>deaths.</b> The zero-risk bias could then be seen as the extreme end of a broad bias about quantities as applied to risk. Framing effects can enhance the bias, for example, by emphasizing a large proportion in a small set or can attempt to mitigate the bias by emphasizing total quantities.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{economic}} pressure on hospitals has accelerated {{the need to}} develop a screening tool for identifying hospitals that potentially provide poor quality care. Based upon data from 93 hospitals and 205, 000 admissions, we used a multiple regression model to adjust the hospitals crude death rate. The adjustment process used age, origin of patient from the emergency department or nursing home, and a hospital case mix index based on DRGs (diagnostic related groups). Before adjustment, hospital death rates ranged from 0. 3 to 5. 8 per 100 admissions. After adjustment, hospital death ratios ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 36 per 100 (<b>actual</b> <b>death</b> rate divided by predicted death rate). Eleven hospitals (12 per cent) were identified where the <b>actual</b> <b>death</b> rate exceeded the predicted death rate by more than two standard deviations. In nine hospitals (10 per cent), the predicted death rate exceeded the <b>actual</b> <b>death</b> rate by a similar statistical margin. The 11 hospitals with higher than predicted death rates may provide inadequate quality of care or have uniquely ill patient populations. The adjusted death rate model needs to be validated and generalized before it can be used routinely to screen hospitals. However, the remaining large differences in observed versus predicted death rates lead us to believe that important differences in hospital performance may exist...|$|R
