5|$|A story-driven game {{set in the}} 1960s, No One Lives Forever {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed for, among other things, its stylistic representation of the era {{in the spirit of}} many spy films and television series of that decade, as well as for its humor. Players control female protagonist Cate Archer, who works for a secret organization that watches over world peace. In addition to a range of firearms, the game contains several gadgets, which are disguised <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> female fashion items.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} 1939 for {{deliveries}} to the Army and Luftwaffe, although the exact numbers {{will never be}} known as they were often not broken out separately in the production reports. At any rate Adler built 1054 between 1939 and February 1943, although some of these were completed as 10/5s beginning in 1942. MWC was awarded two contracts for 975 10/5s to be delivered in 194344, but 13 of these were delivered <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> Sd.Kfz. 10s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much dark matter <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, {{and became the first}} persuasive results supporting the theory of dark matter, initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. Her research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|Radio {{stations}} in the United States often broadcast popular music. Each music station has a format, or a category of songs to be played; these are generally similar to but not the same <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> generic classification. Many radio {{stations in}} the United States are locally owned and operated, and may offer an eclectic assortment of recordings; many other stations are owned by large companies like Clear Channel, and are generally formatted on smaller, more repetitive playlists. Commercial sales of recordings are tracked by Billboard magazine, which compiles a number of music charts for various fields of recorded music sales. The Billboard Hot 100 is the top pop music chart for singles, a recording consisting {{of a handful of}} songs; longer pop recordings are albums, and are tracked by the Billboard 200. Though recorded music is commonplace in American homes, many of the music industry's revenue comes from a small number of devotees; for example, 62% of album sales come from less than 25% of the music-buying audience. Total CD sales in the United States topped 705 million units sold in 2005, and singles sales just under three million.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{may have}} become {{involved}} in battles against the Quadi and Marcomanni immediately after the Battle of the Margus. He eventually {{made his way to}} northern Italy and made an imperial government, but it is not known whether he visited the city of Rome at this time. There is a contemporary issue of coins suggestive of an imperial adventus (arrival) for the city, but some modern historians state that Diocletian avoided the city, and that he did so on principle, as the city and its Senate were no longer politically relevant to the affairs of the empire and needed to be taught as much. Diocletian dated his reign from his elevation by the army, not the date of his ratification by the Senate, following the practice established by Carus, who had declared the Senate's ratification a useless formality. However, Diocletian was to offer proof of his deference towards the Senate by retaining Aristobulus <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> consul and colleague for 285 (one of the few instances during the Late Empire in which an emperor admitted a privatus as his colleague) and by creating senior senators Vettius Aqulinus and Junius Maximus ordinary consuls for the following year â€“ for Maximus, it was his second consulship.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Hancock is shot {{twice in}} the chest and wounded when he foils a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and {{explains}} that as each pair of immortals pair up, they begin to lose their powers and live out the remainder of their lives <b>as</b> <b>ordinary</b> humans, growing old and eventually dying. She then begins to point out various scars that Hancock has acquired over the centuries, the result of his normally heroic nature. She also explains that Hancock was savagely attacked in an alley 80 years prior, which caused his amnesia. In each instance, Mary chose to leave him in order for him to regain his powers and recover from his injuries. However, upon discovering he had no memory, Mary couldn't handle it and left. The conversation is interrupted when the hospital is raided by Red Parker, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary is caught in the cross-fire and is mortally wounded. Hancock is able to stop and kill the two men but suffers additional injuries in the process. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary dying, Hancock flees the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her own powers. He makes several clumsy leaps away from the hospital, each of longer distance and duration as his powers slowly return, until he finally is able to fly off into the night. He later takes up residence in New York City. Ray is seen walking with Mary and their son discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. In gratitude to Ray, Hancock has painted Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to view the worldwide advertisement.|$|E
