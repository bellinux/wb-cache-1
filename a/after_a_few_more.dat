5|$|A quick cut later, the costumed {{character}} {{is looking at}} the camera again with hands at its sides. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the wall, with the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> adventures, Candide and Cacambo {{wander into}} El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where {{the streets are}} covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> people were killed or disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Brooke {{does not}} marry Noel, but rather spends {{a brief period}} in Munich where he tries to become {{intimate}} with a Belgian girl in order to lose his heterosexual virginity. This relationship also fails, and he returns to England confused about his sexuality. He and Nell continue to remain close until he goes on a vacation with his friends, where he again proposes to another of his friends. Brooke is refused resulting in a psychological breakdown and an extended absence from Grantchester while he is treated by a London doctor. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> months, Brooke returns to the Old Vicarage briefly before departing {{on a trip to}} Tahiti via Canada and the United States. The night before he leaves, Nell realises that she still loves Brooke and goes to Brooke's bed the night before he leaves.|$|E
5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out and concentrate on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E
5|$|When Martin {{was between}} Hollywood {{projects}} {{in the summer of}} 1991, he started writing a new science fiction novel called Avalon. After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of A Game of Thrones. Putting Avalon aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that {{it was part of a}} longer story. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> chapters, Martin perceived his new book as a fantasy story and started making maps and genealogies. However, the writing of this book was interrupted for a few years when Martin returned to Hollywood to produce his TV series Doorways that ABC had ordered but ultimately never aired.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> punts, Warner led the Cardinals {{down the}} field on an eight-play, 87-yard scoring drive that took 3:57 off the clock, {{utilizing}} a no huddle offense. With 7:33 left in the game, Warner threw a fade pass to Fitzgerald, who made a leaping catch through tight coverage by Ike Taylor for a touchdown, making the score 20–14.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd later {{returned}} to Hollywood {{to play a}} Nazi spy in Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942), starting a long friendship and professional association with Hitchcock. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> villainous film roles, Lloyd also worked behind the camera as an assistant on Lewis Milestone's Arch of Triumph (1948). A friend of John Garfield, Lloyd appeared with him in He Ran All the Way, Garfield's last film before the Hollywood blacklist ended his film career.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Miami {{got the ball}} with good field {{position}} when Marion intercepted a pass from Kitna on the Dolphins 41, but this merely resulted in three incompletions and a punt. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> drives, a 15-yard facemask penalty against Dolphins defensive lineman Sam Madison turned Ricky Watters' 14-yard run into a 29-yard gain, setting up Todd Peterson's 50-yard field goal {{with less than a}} minute left in the half. The Seahawks finished the half leading 10–3, and had limited Miami to just 69 offensive yards.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Lever and Kitchen and W. H. Burford & Sons formed Australian Producers Partnership Pty Ltd. Burford {{ordinary}} shares were held by Lever and Kitchen; around 1962 <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> takeovers {{the parent company}} was renamed Unilever. The Burford's factory was still running profitably in the mid-50s, and the factory at Dry Creek was still listed as such in 1962; the office at 83 Sturt Street still bore the Burford's name, alongside that of its nominal owner J. Kitchen & Sons Ltd, Rexona Pty. Ltd. and Lever Brothers Pty. Ltd.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> {{years of}} fighting, in 387 BC the Peace of Antalcidas was established, {{according}} to which all Greek cities of Ionia would return to Persian control, and Persia's Asian border would {{be free of the}} Spartan threat. The effects of the war were to reaffirm Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's weakened hegemonic position in the Greek political system. Sparta entered its long-term decline after a severe military defeat to Epaminondas of Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra. This {{was the first time that}} a Spartan army lost a land battle at full strength.|$|E

25|$|The old {{county court}} house {{served as a}} {{temporary}} school. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> students started answering roll call in 1927, a rickety-board school house was erected, which was occupied by Miss Helen Frame as the teacher. This structure was located on Campbell Street directly south and on the same lot as the existing Kermit ISD archives building. The current archives building once served as the cafeteria in the first public school building. In 1927, Hendrick No. 1, {{the name of the}} discovery well in Hendrick Field south of Kermit was completed and oil was discovered in Winkler County–the county that was to boom and bust, boom and bust, until prosperity came in with discovery of deep oil.|$|E
25|$|After leaving JG 5 Oberleutnant Schuck {{was trained}} on the Messerschmitt Me 262 Jet fighter and in early March 1945 was asked by Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) Theodor Weissenberger to join Jagdgeschwader 7 (JG 7—7th Fighter Wing). His maiden flight on the Me 262 was on 20 March 1945. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> familiarizing flights on the Me 262, Schuck and another pilot took off on 24 March 1945 to {{familiarize}} themselves with the high altitude characteristics of the aircraft. Cruising {{at an altitude of}} , flight control informed them of enemy fighters in the vicinity. Schuck immediately set course for the enemy formation and spotted one P-38 Lightning and two P-51 Mustang fighters. In the resulting combat Schuck shot down the two P-51 fighters but the P-38 Lightning escaped.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> hours, {{the strikers}} {{attempted}} {{to burn the}} barges. They seized a raft, loaded it with oil-soaked timber and floated it toward the barges. The Pinkertons nearly panicked, and a Pinkerton captain had to threaten to shoot anyone who fled. But the fire burned itself out before it reached the barges. The strikers then loaded a railroad flatcar with drums of oil and set it afire. The flatcar hurtled down the rails toward the mill's wharf where the barges were docked. But the car stopped at the water's edge and burned itself out. Dynamite was thrown at the barges, but it only hit the mark once (causing a little damage to one barge). At 2:00p.m., the workers poured oil onto the river, hoping the oil slick would burn the barges; attempts to light the slick failed.|$|E
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words <b>more</b> {{the boys}} separated, and Snap {{started to walk}} home. He had almost reached his gate when {{something}} prompted him to halt. He looked down the roadway {{in the direction of}} the old boathouse.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} will--if we can't {{find the}} houseboat," [...] said Sam, and then, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words <b>more</b> {{with the ladies}} and the girls, he started off to rejoin Tom and Dick, and Songbird Powell went with him.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes. She {{was going}} to stop elsewhere, but the captain allowed he’d make {{straight}} for San Juan,” added the captain of the barkentine, through the megaphone he was using. Then, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words <b>more,</b> the two vessels separated.|$|R
25|$|In the 1969–72 cycle Fischer caused {{two more}} crises. He refused {{to play in}} the 1969 US Championship, which was a Zonal Tournament. This would have {{eliminated}} him from the 1969–72 cycle, but Benko was persuaded to concede his place in the Interzonal to Fischer. FIDE President Max Euwe accepted this maneuver and interpreted the rules very flexibly to enable Fischer to play, as he thought it important for the health and reputation of the game that Fischer should have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible. Fischer crushed all opposition and won the right to challenge reigning champion Boris Spassky. After agreeing to play in Yugoslavia, Fischer raised a series of objections and Iceland was the final venue. Even then Fischer raised difficulties, mainly over money. It took a phone call from United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and a doubling of the prize money by financier Jim Slater to persuade him to play. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> traumatic moments Fischer won the match 12½–8½.|$|E
25|$|Heading {{right for}} the junks, Canton opened up with her guns {{and by the time}} she was {{receiving}} enemy fire, Hay's ship came within range and engaged. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> minutes of accurate fire, Chui A-poo's fleet scattered and three junks were abandoned by their crews, most of whom drowned as their vessels were sunk around them. Towards the end of the engagement, shots from the Columbine hit one of the larger junks and it exploded, sending up a large plume of smoke. Ten junks escaped the battle due to the British who chose not to continue the chase for they had an idea about where the brigands were going. The British had already been at station non-stop for forty hours, another reason for abandoning the pursuit. Chui A-poo's pirates were reported to have suffered 250 casualties and a total of over 200 cannon were destroyed or captured and then taken back to Hong Kong. Three Royal Navy sailors were killed on the Columbine and one officer and six men wounded.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>more</b> videos {{with the}} Cosmos Plan and h.m.p. studios in 2002 and 2003, Matsushima retired but {{returned}} to the AV industry and began her long association with the Alice Japan company in December 2003 in Sexy Butt. Matsushima remained with Alice Japan for nearly four years making about one original video per month before releasing her retirement work Kaede Matsuhima's Official Retiring Performance - Smile, Last Message in November 2007. The 4-hour video included favorite scenes from her older works and interviews, all in the new thinner censorship mosaic standard. The studio had earlier in 2007 begun to release some of her previous work in the new mosaic in their Alice Pink File series. Her work at Alice Japan was recognized {{by a number of}} industry and media awards including a 3rd place award for Best Body at the 2004 X City Grand Prix Awards. She also was the recipient of several honors from Video Boy magazine. Her Video Boy awards were Best Body first prize in 2003, the Nice Body 3rd place prize in 2004, the 4th place Best Actress Award in 2004, 5th place Best Actress Award in 2005, and the First Place Idol Award in 2004.|$|E
