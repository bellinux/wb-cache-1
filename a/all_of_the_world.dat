Twelve of the first {{fourteen}} World Series MVPs were won by pitchers; from 1969 until 1986, the proportion of pitcher MVPs declined—Rollie Fingers (1974) and Bret Saberhagen (1985) {{were the only two}} pitchers to win the award in this period. From 1987 until 1991, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Series MVPs were pitchers, and, since 1995, pitchers have won the award nine times. Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees is the only player in World Series history to be named MVP despite being on the losing team.|$|E
25|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya and his Dvaita subschool of Vedanta believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned. Shankara's theory posits that only Brahman and causes are metaphysical unchanging reality, while the empirical world (Maya) and observed effects are changing, illusive and of relative existence. Spiritual liberation to Shankara is the full comprehension and realization of oneness of one's unchanging Atman (soul) as the same as Atman in everyone else as well as being identical to the nirguna Brahman. In contrast, Ramanuja's theory posits both Brahman and the world of matter are two different absolutes, both metaphysically real, neither should be called false or illusive, and saguna Brahman with attributes is also real. God, like man, states Ramanuja, has both soul and body, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of matter is the glory of God's body. The path to Brahman (Vishnu), asserted Ramanuja, is devotion to godliness and constant remembrance of the beauty and love of personal god (saguna Brahman, Vishnu), one which ultimately leads one to the oneness with nirguna Brahman.|$|E

2500|$|Alongside Freud, Nietzsche, and Durkheim, Marx thus takes a place {{amongst the}} 19th century {{philosophers}} who criticized this pre-eminence {{of the subject}} and its consciousness. Instead, Marx saw consciousness as political.

2500|$|Yggdrasil is {{mentioned}} in two {{books in the}} Prose Edda; Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál. In Gylfaginning, Yggdrasil is introduced in chapter 15. In chapter 15, Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) asks where is the chief or holiest place of the gods. High replies [...] "It is the ash Yggdrasil. There the gods must hold their courts each day". Gangleri asks what there is to tell about Yggdrasil. Just-As-High says that Yggdrasil is the biggest {{and best of all}} trees, that its branches extend out over <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and reach out over the sky. Three of the roots of the tree support it, and these three roots also extend extremely far: one [...] "is among the Æsir, the second among the frost jötnar, and the third over Niflheim. The root over Niflheim is gnawed at by the wyrm Níðhöggr, and beneath this root is the spring Hvergelmir. Beneath the root that reaches the frost jötnar is the well Mímisbrunnr, [...] "which has wisdom and intelligence contained in it, and the master of the well is called Mimir". Just-As-High provides details regarding Mímisbrunnr and then describes that the third root of the well [...] "extends to heaven" [...] and that beneath the root is the [...] "very holy" [...] well Urðarbrunnr. At Urðarbrunnr the gods hold their court, and every day the Æsir ride to Urðarbrunnr up over the bridge Bifröst. Later in the chapter, a stanza from Grímnismál mentioning Yggdrasil is quoted in support.|$|E
