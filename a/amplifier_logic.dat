40|$|We {{introduce}} a purely electrical version of Maxwell’s demon {{which does not}} involve mechanically moving parts such as trapdoors, etc. It consists of a capacitor, resistors, <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>logic</b> circuitry and electronically controlled switches and uses thermal noise in resistors (Johnson noise) to pump heat. The only types of energy of importance in this demon are electrical energy and heat. We also demonstrate an entirely electrical version of Szilard’s engine, i. e., an information-controlled device that can produce work by employing thermal fluctuations. The only moving part is a piston that executes work, and the engine has purely electronic controls and it is free of the major weakness of the original Szilard engine in not requiring removal and repositioning the piston {{at the end of}} the cycle. For both devices, the energy dissipation in the memory and other binary informatics components are insignificant compared to the exponentially large energy dissipation in the analog part responsible for creating new information by measurement and decision. This result contradicts the view that the energy dissipation in the memory during erasure is the most essential dissipation process in a demon. Nevertheless the dissipation in the memory and information processing parts is sufficient to secure the Second Law of Thermodynamics. 1...|$|R

40|$|Cryptocircuits can be {{attacked}} by third parties using differential power analysis (DPA), which uses power consumption dependence on data being processed to reveal critical information. To protect security devices against this issue, differential logic styles with (almost) constant power dissipation are widely used. However, {{to use such}} circuits effectively for secure applications {{it is necessary to}} eliminate any energy-secure flaw in security in the shape of memory effects that could leak information. This paper proposes a design methodology to improve pull-down logic configuration for secure differential gates by redistributing the charge stored in internal nodes and thus, removing memory effects that represent a significant threat to security. To evaluate the methodology, it was applied to the design of AND/NAND and XOR/XNOR gates in a 90 nm technology, adopting the sense <b>amplifier</b> based <b>logic</b> (SABL) style for the pull-up network. The proposed solutions leak less information than typical SABL gates, increasing security by at least two orders of magnitude and with negligible performance degradation. A simulation-based DPA attack on the Sbox 9 cryptographic module used in the Kasumi algorithm, implemented with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, SABL and proposed gates, was performed. The results obtained illustrate that the number of measurements needed to disclose the key increased by much more than one order of magnitude when using our proposal.

40|$|Advancements in technology, {{the need}} for {{automation}} and ease of manufacturability, have made embedded systems ubiquitous. One of the preeminent challenges in embedded systems is maintaining the privacy of sensitive information being passed and keeping it secure. Security is {{taken care of by}} the deployment of state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms to encrypt confidential data, which is then decrypted at the receiving end. Some embedded systems are increasingly attacked by adversaries for financial gain, or to obtain personal information. Internal computations are often revealed by external manifestations such as processing time kelsey 00 hamDPA, power consumption kocher 98 DPATechInfo, electromagnetic emission quisquater 01 EM and faults Biham 97 differentialfault. Such manifestations can be exploited by an adversary to obtain secret keys of cryptographic algorithms, and the process of obtaining secret keys using this mechanism is called a Side Channel Attack (SCA). SCAs SCA_ 1,SCA_ 2 are categorized based on the characteristics used for the attack. Two of the main side channel attacks are cache based attacks and power based attacks. Cache based side channel attacks are built using cache behavior of the system when data is exchanged between the processor and the main memory. A Cache is a smaller and faster memory placed between the processor and main memory and stores the information needed for computations in the processor to reduce memory transaction time. Cache based attacks are further classified as time-driven attacks Kocher 96 timingattacks and access-driven attacks Page 02 theoreticaluse. Time-driven attacks use the encryption time during the execution of cryptographic algorithm in the processor while access-driven attacks are performed when the adversary gets access to the data stored in the cache. Power based attacks are mounted by measuring power variations during the encryption/decryption of a cryptographic algorithm. A successful recovery of the secret key allows the adversary to fake identities and gain benefits. Power based attacks are classified into Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. In SPA Kocher: 1999 :DPA: 646764. 703989, internal data is retrieved directly by analyzing the power magnitude, while in DPA mangard 2007 power, much advanced statistical analysis is performed to predict the secret key. Several solutions exist to counter both cache based and power based side channel attacks. Cache attacks can be avoided by using architectural modifications Wang 07 newcache,Page_countermeasure 1, time skewing Page_countermeasure, cache warming Page_countermeasure, use of maximum cache line size Page_countermeasure,etc. The countermeasures used against power based attacks are masking Messerges: 2000 :SAF: 647935. 740925, sense <b>amplifier</b> based <b>logic</b> Dynamic_differential_CMOS_logic, wave dynamic differential logic Tiri 05 aside-channel,Tiri_Intel,tiri 04 ASIC, dual rail circuits Sokolov: 2005 :DAD: 1048716. 1048837, etc. Existing techniques to counter cache based and power based attacks are either costly in terms of power and area or involve much complexity, hence lack practicality. In this thesis, the author has implemented a fast trace-driven cache attack, and incorporated this attack into a flexible framework containing an extensible processor. The processor used is the Tensilicas Xtensa LX 2 with modifiable architecture which allows changes in cache architecture, instruction set and addition of extra hardware. On the framework, the author implemented a hardware/software countermeasure and has shown {{that it is difficult to}} differentiate the cache misses for differing encryptions. The processor with the countermeasure is 30 % more energy efficient, 17 % more power efficient and 15 % faster when compared to processor without the countermeasure. However, there is an area overhead of 7. 6 %. To protect the system from power based side channel attack, the author proposed a double width algorithmic balancing using a single core to obfuscate power variations resulting in a DPA resistant system. The countermeasure only includes code/algorithmic modifications, hence can be easily deployed in any embedded system with a 16 bit wide (or wider) processor. The DPA attack is demonstrated on the Double Width Single Core (DWSC) solution. The attack proved unsuccessful in finding the secret key. The instruction memory size overhead is only 16. 6 % and the data memory increases by 15. 8 %. The future extensions of the above two countermeasures involve the merging of both and improvements to combat both cache based and power based side channel attacks in one system...|$|R
40|$|The rapidly-growing data {{throughput}} rates {{in a wide}} range of wireless communication applications are pushing the established semiconductor device technologies to their limits. Considerably higher levels of solidstate output power will therefore be needed to meet the demand in the next generation satellite communications as well as the RADAR systems. Owing to their superior material properties such as high breakdown fields and peak electron velocities, GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have recently prevailed in high-power systems operating in the microwave frequency bands. On the other hand, technologies based on GaAs or InP still make up a large portion of the state-of-the-art devices and circuits at the millimetre-wave (MMW) and sub-MMW frequencies. Due to the strong dependence of the intrinsic device parameters on the applied bias point, highly-scaled GaN HEMTs are prone to experiencing deteriorated high frequency characteristics which severely limit the highpower performance as well. Here, the relatively poor control of the gate electrode is known to be the underlying root of the performance drop. In an attempt to overcome this by means of reinforcing the gate-control, 3 -dimensional GaN HEMT devices featuring the Tri-gate topology are developed in this work, exhibiting enhanced performance in terms of both off- and on-state figures of merit. One of the first obstacles is establishing a Tri-gate process scheme that is fully compatible with the planar-gate GaN HEMT process, allowing for a straightforward integration. On that account, electron-beam-defined mesa etching is found to be the most applicable method for patterning the nano-channels which constitute the Tri-gate FETs with promising device characteristics. It is then shown that a thorough optimisation of the fin geometry and a 3 -D passivation approach help improving the on-state DC performance as well as suppressing the short channel effects (SCE) in the off-state. By taking advantage of the superior gate-control, normally-off AlGaN/GaN FinFETs are subsequently presented with as high as + 0. 2 V of threshold and 60 V of breakdown voltages, as opposed to - 1. 7 V of threshold and 28 V of breakdown voltages achieved by the conventional GaN FETs. In order to further improve the on-state performance, advanced heterostructures with InAlGaN and AlN barriers are employed which result in up to 3. 8 A/mm of saturation drain current density, being one of the highest recorded values among GaN-based Tri-gate devices. Following the DC-improvements, both small- and large-signal parameters of the Tri-gate HEMTs are then optimised towards a more linear behaviour with respect to the bias point. Once again, with the help of alternative barrier layers and the reduction of the parasitic gate capacitances, a flatter RFtransconductance behaviour is achieved, leading to a bias-independent current-gain cut-off frequency of higher than 60 GHz. It is also revealed by the large-signal load-pull investigation that a maximum RF output power density of 3. 7 W/mm (compared to 2. 5 W/mm of the planar FETs) can be reached by the AlN/GaN FinFETs while showing a simultaneous ft of 80 GHz. Finally, the presented W-band power amplifier with 30 dBm of saturated output power and logic inverter designs for the first time demonstrate the excellent circuit-level performance of the GaNbased Tri-gate devices. In the end, the developed GaN Tri-gate technology is proven to be a viable candidate for achieving significantly higher RF output power without undergoing a cut-off frequency degradation. The demonstrated results of the fabricated monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) with Watt-level output power up to 90 GHz also promote the great potential of Tri-gate FETs for both MMW power <b>amplifier</b> and high-speed <b>logic</b> applications...|$|R
