From the different echo times used we conclude that an increase in this resonance has to be assigned to glycine rather than myo-inositol. This resonance might be used to grade human gliomas more reliably. Total creatine (Cr) decreased more drastically with malignancy than N-acetylated metabolites (NA). This led to a higher NA/Cr ratio in GBM compared to astrocytoma grade II. NA/Cr was thus pseudonormal in GBM due to a change in both nominator and denominator. This study reveals the importance of comparing magnetic resonance spectroscopy data of lesions to spectra measured in identical localizations in healthy control subjects instead of NAM and the importance of quantifying single metabolic peaks instead of creating metabolic ratios in clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{trend in}} natural {{language}} processing research has been to develop systems that deal with text concerning small, well defined domains. One practical application for such systems is to process messages pertaining to some very specific task or activity [5]. The advantage of dealing with such domains is twofold- firstly, due to the narrowness of the domain, {{it is possible to}} encode most of the knowledge related to the domain and to make this knowledge accessible to the {{natural language processing}} system, which in turn can use this knowledge to disambiguate the meanings of the messages. Secondly, in such a domain, there is not a great diversity of language constructs and therefore it becomes easier to construct a grammar which will capture all the constructs which exist in this sub-language. However, some practical aspects of such domains tend to make the problem somewhat difficult. Often, the messages tend not to be <b>absolutely</b> grammatically <b>correct.</b> As a result, the grammar designed for such a system needs to be far more forgiving than one designed for the task of parsing edited English. This can result in a proliferation of parses, which in turn makes the disambiguation task more difficult. This problem is further compounded by the telegraphic nature of the discourse, since telegraphic discourse is more prone to be syntactically ambiguous. Statistical Parsing The major objective of the research described in this paper is to use statistical data to evaluate the likelihood of a parse in order to help the parser prune out unlikely parses.

2500|$|One {{important}} feature of a FROG measurement is that many more data points are collected than are strictly necessary to find the pulse electric field. [...] For example, say that the measured trace consists of 128 points in the delay direction and 128 points in the frequency direction. [...] There are 128×128 total points in the trace. [...] Using these points, an electric field is retrieved that has 2×128 points (128 for magnitude and another 128 for the phase). [...] This is a massively overdetermined system, meaning {{that the number of}} equations is much larger than the number of unknowns. [...] Thus the importance of each individual data point being <b>absolutely</b> <b>correct</b> is greatly reduced. [...] This is very helpful for real-world measurements that can be affected by detector noise and systematic errors. [...] Noise is extremely unlikely to affect the measured trace in a way that could be confused with a physical phenomenon in the pulse. [...] The FROG algorithm tends to “see through” these effects due to the amount of extra information available and the use of a mathematical form constraint in finding a solution. [...] This means that the error between an experimental FROG trace and a retrieved FROG trace is rarely zero, although it should be quite small for traces without systematic errors.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1990, the States News Service {{published}} {{a study by}} journalist Kathy Kadane which highlighted significant U.S. involvement in the killings. Kadane quoted Robert J.

Martens told Kadane that [...] "It really was a big help to the army. They probably killed a lot of people, and I probably {{have a lot of}} blood on my hands, but that's not all bad. There's a time when you have to strike hard at a decisive moment." [...] Kadane wrote that approval for the release of names put on the lists came from top U.S. embassy officials; Ambassador Marshall Green, deputy chief of mission Jack Lydman and political section chief Edward Masters. The accuracy of Kadane's report was challenged by those officials in a July 1990 article in The New York Times. Martens asserted that he alone compiled the list from the Indonesian communist press, that the names were [...] "available to everyone," [...] and that [...] "no one, absolutely no one, helped me compile the lists in question." [...] He admitted to providing the list of [...] "a few thousand" [...] names of PKI leaders and senior cadre (but not the party rank and file) to Indonesian [...] "non-Communist forces" [...] during the [...] "six months of chaos," [...] but denied any CIA or embassy involvement.

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of the karāmāt al-awliyāʾ, which became enshrined as an orthodox and required belief {{in many of the}} most prominent Sunni creeds of the classical era such as the Creed of Tahawi (ca. 900) and the Creed of Nasafi (ca. 1000), emerged from the two basic Islamic doctrinal sources of the Quran and the hadith. As the Quran referred to the miracles of non-prophetic saintly people like Khidr (18:65-82), the disciples of Jesus (5:111-115), and the People of the Cave (18:7-26), amongst many others, many prominent early scholars deduced that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but who are nevertheless capable of performing miracles. The references in the corpus of hadith literature to bona fide miracle-working saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲ (seemingly an Arabic form of the Greek Grēgorios), only lent further credence to this early understanding of the miracles of the saints. The fourteenth-century Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), in spite of his well-known objections to the visiting of saints' graves, nevertheless stated: [...] "The miracles of saints are <b>absolutely</b> true and <b>correct,</b> by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."

5000|$|From {{the twelfth}} to the fourteenth century, [...] "the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its {{definitive}} form {{with the organization}} of Sufism—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods." [...] In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be [...] "a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... found permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples." [...] It was {{by virtue of his}} spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, [...] "and it is this which ... effected his 'canonization,' and not some ecclesiastical institution" [...] as in Christianity. In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of canonization. In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam [...] that many of the most important creeds articulated during the time period, like the famous Creed of Tahawi, explicitly declared it a requirement for being an [...] "orthodox" [...] Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of saints and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles. Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of venerating the tombs of saints, like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the Hanbali jurist stating: [...] "The miracles of saints are <b>absolutely</b> true and <b>correct,</b> by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."

It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may {{have had a chance to}} escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to." [...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; [...] "I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this.

40|$|Sex {{development}} comprises {{a series}} of sequential events that act under strong genetic control. This complex process {{is responsible for the}} achievement of sexual dimorphism and functionality, necessary for reproduction and maintenance of the species. Sex development {{is the result of the}} interactions of multiple time and dose-sensitive genes. Although in the last 15 years important scientific progress has been made in our knowledge of the molecular pathways and genes underlying sex development, many factors still remain unknown. Any dysregulation of the mechanisms responsible for sex development may lead to “Disorders of Sex Development” (DSDs), comprising a large group of congenital conditions characterized by “atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal or phenotypic sex”. Due to the complex clinical considerations associated with DSD patients, a precise and well-timed diagnosis is <b>absolutely</b> indispensable. A <b>correct</b> diagnosis is essential to make decisions regarding correct gender assignment and is the basis for appropriate short- and long-term management of DSD patients, to optimise future quality of life. Development of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic protocols is strongly linked to a deeper understanding of the complex molecular/genetic pathways at the basis of sex development. The purpose of this research has been to improve our understanding of sex development and to provide new insights into the causes of DSDs by studying RSPO 1, a new gene we demonstrated to be involved in gonadal development. R-spondin 1, a member of a new protein family involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway, is a gene we discovered to be mutated in a patient with a syndromic form of XX “true hermaphroditism”. The effects of this mutation on mRNA and protein production have been investigated. Moreover, differences between wild-type and mutant protein found in our patient have been evaluated, by investigating RSPO 1 cellular expression, localization and secretion. To clarify the mechanism of action of RSPO 1, functional analysis has been performed using luciferase assays. Preliminary data about identification of RSPO 1 target pathways and genes have been achieved by overexpression and microarray approaches. The work of this thesis has led to further elucidate the role of R-spondin 1 in gonadal determination and to expand the spectrum of DSD phenotypes related to RSPO 1 mutations. Our studies to define the role of R-spondin 1 might lead to the development of new tools in the diagnosis and treatment of DSD pathologies...|$|R
