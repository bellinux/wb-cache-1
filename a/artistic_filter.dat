40|$|This paper {{looks at}} painterly rending using filter {{blending}} {{to create a}} novel range of artistic effects. We look into several techniques {{in the field of}} painterly rendering and combine these different rendering styles together in a user defined way to create a new filter. This creates a user defined painting style based on aspects of different painting styles and processes. The final application uses a triangular region for human-computer interaction where each corner represents an <b>artistic</b> <b>filter</b> and the middle of this triangle represents the original image. A point within the triangle is chosen to determine the filters that are used for blending and their contributing strengths. Artistic effects are based on three base filters that can be tailored by the user to suit the specific subject matter of the image...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} constrained graphcut texture synthesis (CGS), a graphcut-based synthesis algorithm {{that creates}} out-put textures satisfying constraints. We show that constrained texture synthesis can be posed in a principled way as an optimization problem that requires balancing two measures of quality: constraint satisfaction and texture seamlessness. We then present an efficient algorithm for finding good solutions to this problem, using generalized graphcut minimization. CGS enables explicit control while preserving {{the speed and}} quality benefits of graphcut texture synthesis. This approach supports the full image analogies framework, while providing superior image quality and performance. A range of applications of CGS are demonstrated, including detail synthesis, <b>artistic</b> <b>filtering</b> by analogy, and texture-by-numbers. CGS is easily extended to handle multiple constraints on a single output, thus enabling novel applications that combine both user-specified and image-based control.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new framework for processing images by example, called "image analogies. " The framework involves two stages: a design phase, {{in which a}} pair of images, with one image purported to be a "filtered" version of the other, is presented as "training data"; and an application phase, in which the learned filter is applied to some new target image {{in order to create}} an "analogous " filtered result. Image analogies are based on a simple multiscale autoregression, inspired primarily by recent results in texture synthesis. By choosing different types of source image pairs as input, the framework supports a wide variety of "image filter" effects, including traditional image filters, such as blurring or embossing; improved texture synthesis, in which some textures are synthesized with higher quality than by previous approaches; super-resolution, in which a higher-resolution image is inferred from a low-resolution source; texture transfer, in which images are "texturized" with some arbitrary source texture; <b>artistic</b> <b>filters,</b> in which various drawing and painting styles are synthesized based on scanned real-world examples; and texture-by-numbers, in which realistic scenes, composed of a variety of textures, are created using a simple painting interface...|$|R
40|$|The arts {{have much}} to offer the reinvention of places: {{generating}} new forms of employment in cultural work, contributing to public culture through festivals and events, and appropriating spaces in the built environments of our cities and towns for <b>artistic</b> expression. <b>Filtering</b> <b>artistic</b> attempts to re-make places are three key competing pressures: first, the demands of regional development managers, treasury bureaucrats and council general managers for accountability, ‘hard data’ and measurable outcomes; second, desires of local residents, non-profit organisations and community development specialists to use the arts {{as a means to}} promote social inclusion and recognition of social difference; and third, professional concerns of artists themselves to produce creative expressions that advance practice, experiment, and/or challenge prevailing norms. Often, these pressures are thought of as irreconcilable or incorrigible. I will discuss examples from two key projects—one on using new computer mapping technologies to trace the relationship between creativity and the city, the other Australia’s largest-ever study of rural and regional festivals—that show it is possible to re-make places in creative, challenging ways as well as improve social outcomes—and even to speak to bean-counters in the language of ‘hard data’...|$|R
40|$|Vector {{graphics}} provides powerful {{tools for}} drawing scalable 2 D imagery. With {{the rise of}} mobile computers, {{of different types of}} displays and image resolutions, vector graphics is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, vector graphics is not the leading framework for creating and manipulating 2 D imagery. The reason for this reluctance of employing vector graphical frameworks is {{that it is difficult to}} handle complex behaviour of colour across the 2 D domain. A challenging problem within vector graphics is to define smooth colour functions across the image. In previous work, two approaches exist. The first approach, known as diffusion curves, diffuses colours from a set of input curves and points. The second approach, known as gradient meshes, defines smooth colour functions from control meshes. These two approaches are incompatible: diffusion curves do not support the local behaviour provided by gradient meshes and gradient meshes do not support freeform curves as input. My research aims to narrow the gap between diffusion curves and gradient meshes. With this aim in mind, I propose solutions to create control meshes from freeform curves. I demonstrate that these control meshes can be used to render a vector primitive similar to diffusion curves using subdivision surfaces. With the use of subdivision surfaces, instead of a diffusion process, colour gradients can be locally controlled using colour-gradient curves associated with the input curves. The advantage of local control is further explored in the setting of vector-centric image processing. I demonstrate that a certain contrast enhancement profile, known as the Cornsweet profile, can be modelled via surfaces in images. This approach does not produce saturation artefacts related with previous filter-based methods. Additionally, I demonstrate various approaches to <b>artistic</b> <b>filtering,</b> where the artist locally models given artistic effects. Gradient meshes are restricted to rectangular topology of the control meshes. I argue that this restriction hinders the applicability of the approach and its potential to be used with control meshes extracted from freeform curves. To this end, I propose a mesh-based vector primitive that supports arbitrary manifold topology of the mesh...|$|R

The subject matter of many artworks in this exhibition initially come across as familiar as their topics reflect on popular subjects. There is a range of attitudes represented from the irreverent, to darkly humorous, to the violent and poetic, that these <b>artistic</b> responses are <b>filtered</b> through. Much of the work involves popular collective memory and marks a certain point of cultural time. The artists engage quite directly with their respective content, and do not attempt to establish decorative, esoteric, romantic or scientific positions. Instead, they deal with the authoritative aspect that these central images represent. Each unique approach culminates in something far more invigorating and meaningful than its original inspiration...|$|R
40|$|Any {{consideration}} of Estonian theatre {{from the point}} of view of biographical theatre needs to include the work of playwright and director Merle Karusoo. Productions based on various life narratives (diaries, letters, biographical interviews) form the core of her work that can be defined as biographical or memory theatre. Her work has also been viewed within the context of community theatre or political theatre; Karusoo has herself referred to her work as sociological theatre. Life narratives have functioned in Karusoo’s productions as the basis for restoring oppressed or denied collective discourses of memory. Her productions emerged within the framework of the more general process of restoration of historical heritage and the rehabilitation of collective memory at the end of the 1980 s and the beginning of the 1990 s. Life story can be viewed as the essence of Merle Karusoo’s theatre. The personal in the life story in the production activates the emotional memory of the audience; for older generations such theatre facilitates a legitimisation of remembering one’s life story in entirety, and for younger generations it functions as a vehicle of collective, historical and national memory. The current article outlines the main stages of Karusoo’s biographical theatre, highlights major productions of each stage and provides an overview of their reception. Karusoo’s theatre dates back to 1980 s. Productions based on life stories of the generations born in 1950 s and 1960 s, Meie elulood (Our Biographies) and Kui ruumid on täis [...] . (Full Rooms) both in 1982, mediated fragments of life stories of 16 drama students, focusing on the processes of self-conception and -reflection of young persons. In the context of the Soviet regime that exerted firm ideological control over the private lives of its citizens, Karusoo’s productions struck an especially powerful and unusual chord. Karusoo’s biographical theatre has gathered momentum and assumed a more solid shape since the end of the 1980 s. Productions based on the diaries and/or letters of women [...] Aruanne (The Report, 1987) and Haigete laste vanemad (The Parents of Sick Children, 1988) [...] are mono-dramas, reflecting upon the loss of the voice and life story of an individual and the theme of historical conformism and fear brought about by the violent and hypocritical nature of the Soviet society. The next stage of Karusoo’s work focused on the “destiny years” of the Estonian nation, featuring, for example, life stories focusing on failed emigration to the West and the life experience of those executing the orders of the Soviet authorities during the 1949 deportations. Productions such as Kured läinud, kurjad ilmad (Snows of Sorrow), Sügis 1944 (Autumn 1944), both in 1997 and Küüdipoisid (The Waggoners, 1999) belong to this stage. The reception of Waggoners as a production that eroded the “us” and “them” binaries of the national community was especially polemical. In 2000, when the bilingual Save Our Souls was staged, focusing on the lives of prison inmates convicted of manslaughter and featuring both Estonian and Russian-speaking actors, marked the emergence of the theme of ethnic minorities in Estonia in Karusoo’s work. Karusoo’s biographical productions have evolved from generational life stories and the life stories of individuals to collective portraits of historically and/or socially determined groups. In 2006 Karusoo staged generation monologues Täna me ei mängi (Today We Will Not Play) and Küpsuskirjand 2005 (Essay 2005) that make visible how the semantic space of “us” and the phenomenon of “returning” the life stories to the people have assumed increasingly wider dimensions in Karusoo’s work over decades. Karusoo’s theatrical method has been compared with the work of Jerzy Grotowski and Eugenio Barba, Ariane Mnouchkine and Suzanne Osten, Anna Deavere Smith and German theatrical grouping Rimini Protokoll. Karusoo has herself emphasized that the process of self-conceptualisation needs to proceed via the story of one’s own people, and the past has to be remembered in an emotional way. Her biographical theatre has subjected life stories to <b>artistic</b> <b>filtering,</b> resulting in the enhancement of their affective resonance as well as in generalizations. Her productions have theatrically mapped an extensive share of Estonia’s life narrative and historical memory-scapes. <br /...|$|R
