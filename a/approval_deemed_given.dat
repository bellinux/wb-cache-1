30|$|The {{research}} {{committee for the}} trust was contacted, and ethical <b>approval</b> was <b>deemed</b> unnecessary for this study. With regard to the means of distributing the questionnaire, {{a number of studies}} have shown that e-mail surveys are associated with a smaller response rate than traditional mail surveys [9, 10]. However, combined e-mail surveys, with telephone follow-up, have been found to be the most efficient means of conducting a survey [11]. A response rate over 50 % was chosen as satisfactory, reflecting the mean response rates of physician surveys in the literature [9]. A reminder was sent to all staff after a period of 2 weeks. Provision was made to contact non-responders by telephone to achieve an adequate response rate; however, a single reminder by e-mail was sufficient to achieve this.|$|R

5000|$|Inside the Soviet Union's Moldavian SSR, Robot's overall {{contribution}} was reassessed during the 1960s, and, {{similar to those}} of other authors who had died in the war, was republished by the state-run publishing houses. Such efforts were notably made by literary critic and historian Simion Cibotaru, who edited a selection of Robot's poems. However, George Meniuc was reputedly the first intellectual who reviewed Robot's poetry for a Soviet public, in a 1965 article for Moldova Socialistă, and sparked a long succession of similar studies by other authors and researchers. Until the fall of the Soviet Union and the independence of Moldova (1991), author Mihai Vakulovski argues, Robot {{was also one of the}} writers who received official <b>approval,</b> being <b>deemed</b> characteristic for the Moldavian SSR's culture.
