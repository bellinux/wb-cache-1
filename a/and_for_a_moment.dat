5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting {{began in the}} stands <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{it looked as though}} fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the balance}} of power {{appeared}} to move slightly in Matilda's favour. Robert of Gloucester besieged Stephen in 1143 at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the Battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time, before finally managing to escape. Later in the year Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in rebellion against Stephen in East Anglia. Geoffrey based himself from the Isle of Ely and began a military campaign against Cambridge, with the intention of progressing south towards London. Ranulf of Chester revolted once again in the summer of 1144.|$|E
5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> they believed {{he was going to}} fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting it out with the German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E

Waltz is introduced.|$|R

5|$|The {{situation}} on the Muslim left wing which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} the two sides in England reached a {{stalemate}} in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time. On this occasion, however, William Martel, Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield. Stephen valued William's loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange Sherborne Castle for his safe release—this {{was one of the few}} instances where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one of his men.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of La Marfée {{took place}} during Thirty Years' War near Sedan, France, on 6 July 1641, between a Royal army of Louis XIII under Marshall Gaspard III de Coligny, and French malcontents led by Prince Louis de Bourbon, Count of Soissons, and Duke Frédéric Maurice de La Tour d'Auvergne, duc de Bouillon, who were {{supported}} by an Imperial-Spanish army under general Guillaume de Lamboy sent from the Spanish Netherlands by the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria. The French malcontents and the Habsburg forces dealt a serious defeat to the French Royal Army, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Cardinal Richelieu feared that the rebels, supported by the Spanish forces, would advance on Paris. Shortly after, however, Soissons fell dead, either murdered by an assassin or killed by himself accidentally, and the rebellion vanished.|$|E

25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it looked like EastEnders might have been about to do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs {{of the disease and}} the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
25|$|Once in the match, Sakuraba {{was able}} to sneak in a double leg {{takedown}} after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening it up to spin for a kneebar, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba's leg, but he was thwarted {{by a combination of}} Sakuraba's submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki's back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away momentarily from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault Funaki's legs with a series of kicks, which Funaki answered with an upkick of his own, cutting Sakuraba's eye. Kazushi then returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him, but Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a Kimura lock or double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.|$|E

50|$|At sunrise {{the battle}} started, but {{surprisingly}} {{it was the}} Vendéens and Chouans who launched {{it in order to}} take the Touchelais woods and not be surrounded. The attack was commanded by Lyrot and saw success: they captured two cannons and 40 prisoners. Soon after, Kléber launched a counter-attack with his Gendarmes regiment, charging with bayonets and forcing the Vendéens to pull back to the gates of Savenay. In the center, Marceau, commanding the légion des Francs and Chasseurs de Kastel, encountered difficulties <b>and</b> was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> restrained by the Vendéen artillery.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} the French troops were debouching from Ligny, the 12th Brigade (Colonel Stülpnagel's) was posted in front of Sombreffe; and Colonel Rohr had just pushed forward towards Ligny with the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Kurmark Landwehr, when he {{perceived}} three French cavalry regiments advancing against {{the right wing of}} the brigade; whereupon he gradually retired, and the whole brigade threw itself into Sombreffe, just as the French cavalry made an attack at the entrance of Sombreffe, and captured the two guns of the Battery No. 12, which had been posted there. Major Dorville faced about the rear division of the 6th Kurmai'k Landwehr Cavalry, and gallantly attacked the French cavalry, in the hope of checking their progress; but the lances of his troopers were shivered against the cuirasses of their opponents, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> the former could only defend themselves with their broken poles. The Prussian Infantry, however, hastened forward in support; the French were driven out of the village; and one of the lost guns was retaken.|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} there was {{something}} of unexpected interest. Waving their school flag in triumph from the gable window of the old building the lads from the South Side High School shouted their school yell and BAD DEFIANCE TO ALL COMERS. [...] At this point the Central High School scholars were billed to relieve the South Siders, and consequently surrounded the building. [...] The spirit of school rivalry broke out, strong and bitter. The South Siders refused to surrender the fortress and flaunted their banner from the window {{in spite of all}} entreaties and orders. Contractor Pratt could not oust them. Supt. Jordan could not oust them, and finally Sergeant Martinson called for a detail of police and made a rush for the house. But the South Side lads were still game, and did not give up until several had been made to feel the force of police authority. Then they made a break. As they dashed from one door the Centrals entered by the other, and their banner was soon flying from the gable amid vociferous cheers. The South Siders were chased up the street by a detachment of Centrals, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> it looked as if the rush would result in some bruised heads. However, good nature was restored and again the house started on its way.|$|E
500|$|Time magazine, {{music critic}} Robert Christgau and AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine all {{declared}} the track {{as one of}} CrazySexyCool best. [...] "In many ways, TLC at least musically, were best when {{they were the most}} subtle," [...] commented Complex Michael Arceneaux. In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced you into the arms of another lady, now you just have to keep it on the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with tennis shoes on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6." [...] Music critic Smokey Fontaine even named the track Austin's best work: [...] "Here, the harmonies worked, the bass line was hard enough to compete in a hip-hop world, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> R didn't need a guest rapper." ...|$|E

2500|$|Den and Angie's {{traumatic}} two-hander {{episode in}} October 1986 was a risky experiment. A thirty-minute episode {{with only two}} people in {{it had never been}} attempted in a soap before. Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did. Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a [...] "tennis match" [...] between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window-cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but eventually Angie's hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a big lie. Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered {{to be one of the}} finest episodes in EastEnders catalogue.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Pony (Pony-Citroën) was produced until 1983; in the meanwhile, the law concerning taxation of similar vehicles had been modified. Plans to manufacture other cars under license were not realized <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{it seemed that}} NAMCO would once more be out of business. But the company would bounce back, introducing a completely new model, the Pony Super, introduced in 1985. The second generation Pony had no connection with Citroën technology and was a much more modern car with Ford engines, coming {{in a number of}} versions (950 cc , 1100 cc , 1300 cc [...] and 1600 cc [...] diesel, in two- and four-door arrangements). It was essentially developed by NAMCO, since Inthelco, a German company also involved in its development, was majority-owned by NAMCO at the time. An ambitious plan was made to export the car to the U.S. with a 1900 cc engine via Inthelco as the Desta at a rate of 20,000 per year. However, the costs and prospects proved to be grossly miscalculated and the plan was abandoned. No matter how improved the new Pony was, it was still {{a far cry from the}} needs of the contemporary Greek market made of progressively more affluent and demanding consumers. Only a few hundred Pony Super's were built until 1992.|$|E

After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. [...] "I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested.

Director Peter Jackson considers Sam this scene in the director’s commentary of the scene and argues that Tolkien isn’t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race, but the evil that’s driving them from their authority, These sentiments, Jackson argues, were derived from Tolkien’s experience in the Great War and found their way into his writings to show the evils of war itself, not of other races.|$|R
