The British in turn inflicted at least 30 casualties upon the Indonesians, but an exact number cannot be determined.|$|E

5|$|Swirral Edge {{offers a}} shorter but equally {{exciting}} scramble along a similar sharp arête. The main path to {{it comes up}} from Red Tarn, which is linked by <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> level path to Hole-in-the-Wall, making this ridge equally accessible from Patterdale as from Glenridding. The ridge walk can be extended to include the summit of Catstye Cam.|$|E

5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until I concluded that the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> fair trial.|$|E
5|$|Just as the 1630s replica {{has proven}} to be an {{accurate}} copy of the lost original, the panorama {{has proven to}} be <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> reliable historical document offering a rare and detailed glimpse of medieval Stockholm. The landscape and a great number of notable buildings are correctly rendered in such great detail, that historical censorship, misinterpretations, and later restorations have not prevented modern research from repeatedly corroborating the painting's accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of civil}} {{conflict}} continued, however, and Parliament {{decided that it}} was necessary to slight, or damage so as to put beyond military use, the castle in 1652, as it remained <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> powerful fortress and a continuing threat should any fresh uprising occur. The castle was virtually razed to the ground in the operation, although a brick building continued {{to be used as a}} prison into the 18th century. A large house was built in the bailey in 1700, followed by a gothic mansion house on the same site in 1837.|$|E

Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.|$|E

Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{approach}} to government was less subtle {{than his father}} and brother. Once Emperor, he quickly dispensed with the Republican facade and transformed his government more or less formally into the divine monarchy he believed it to be. By moving the centre of power to the imperial court, Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced. Nevertheless, Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had virtually excluded non-Flavians from public office, Domitian rarely favoured his own family members {{in the distribution of}} strategic posts, admitting <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, and assigning men of the equestrian order to run the imperial bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} played during the Cold War, and intense {{feelings}} of nationalism were aroused in both Canada and the Soviet Union, {{as well as}} on the ice. The games introduced several talented Soviet players to North America, such as Alexander Yakushev, Valeri Kharlamov and goaltender Vladislav Tretiak; the latter two are Hockey Hall of Fame inductees. Team Canada, the first NHL and professional all-star team formed for international play, was led by Phil Esposito, who led the series in scoring, as well as contributing in other roles. The Canadian line of Bobby Clarke, Ron Ellis and Henderson, which was not expected to start for the team, as none were yet stars, played <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> large role in the Canadian win. The series was filled with controversy, starting with the exclusion of top Canadian player Bobby Hull and including disputes over officiating, dirty play on the part of both teams and the deliberate injury of Kharlamov by Clarke in game six.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū's {{consecutive}} basho streak {{came to an}} end in January 2006, when ōzeki Tochiazuma {{took the}} first tournament championship of the year. Asashōryū's performance in January was <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> poor 11–4 but he successfully rebounded by winning the March tournament. However, his six losses in those tournaments matched his loss total for all of 2005. In the May tournament, he sustained an injury to the ligaments in his elbow on the second day falling out of the ring in a surprising loss to Wakanosato and was visibly slow to rise from the ground. He was absent from the tournament the next day and later released a statement confirming he was withdrawing from the tournament. Doctors told him {{he would not be able}} to compete for two months, which meant he would miss the July tournament as well. However, Asashōryū was ready by the start of the July tournament and won with a 14–1 record. In the following tournament, Asashōryū won his eighteenth career title with a 13–2 record. He also won the final tournament of 2006 for his nineteenth career title, the fifth he has won with a perfect 15–0 record.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer {{was born}} in 1489 in Aslockton in Nottinghamshire, England. His parents, Thomas and Agnes (née Hatfield) Cranmer, were of modest wealth and were not members of the aristocracy. Their oldest son, John, {{inherited}} the family estate, whereas Thomas {{and his younger brother}} Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career. Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years {{after the death of his}} father, he was sent to the newly created Jesus College, Cambridge. It took him <b>a</b> <b>surprisingly</b> long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval scholastic books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the humanists, Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples and Erasmus. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his Master of Arts degree in 1515, he was elected to a Fellowship of Jesus College.|$|E
