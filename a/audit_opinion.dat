5|$|Moores {{eventually}} {{sold the}} club to American businessmen George Gillett and Tom Hicks on 6 February 2007. The deal valued the club and its outstanding debts at £218.9million. The pair paid £5,000per share, or £174.1m for the total shareholding and £44.8m to cover the club's debts. Disagreements between Gillett and Hicks, and the fans' lack of support for them, resulted in the pair looking to sell the club. Martin Broughton was appointed chairman of the club on 16 April 2010 to oversee its sale. In May 2010, accounts were released showing the holding company of {{the club to}} be £350m in debt (due to leveraged takeover) with losses of £55m, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its <b>audit</b> <b>opinion.</b> The group's creditors, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, took Gillett and Hicks to court {{to force them to}} allow the board to proceed with the sale of the club, the major asset of the holding company. A High Court judge, Mr Justice Floyd, ruled in favour of the creditors and {{paved the way for the}} sale of the club to Fenway Sports Group (formerly New England Sports Ventures), although Gillett and Hicks still had the option to appeal. Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} sold to Fenway Sports Group during the 2010–11 season. Accounts had shown that Liverpool were £350million in debt with losses of £55million, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its <b>audit</b> <b>opinion.</b> The Royal Bank of Scotland who were the club's creditors, took owners Gillett and Hicks to court to force through a sale. The court ruled in the creditors' favour and the club {{was sold to}} Fenway Sports Group for £300million on 15 October 2010. On the pitch, Liverpool's {{performances}} were poor. A 3–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in January, left the club in twelfth place in the league with nine defeats from twenty games. Hodgson was sacked after the match and replaced by former manager Dalglish. After a loss in his first match against Manchester United in the FA Cup, Liverpool eventually finished the season in sixth place. Dalglish bought several players {{at the start of}} the 2011–12 season, including Charlie Adam, Stewart Downing and Jordan Henderson. They finished in eighth place, the club's worst finish in eighteen years. In both the League Cup and FA Cup, they reached the final. The club won a record eighth League Cup, with a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory against Cardiff City after the match finished 2–2. Liverpool lost the 2012 FA Cup Final 2–1 to Chelsea. The season was marred by the Luis Suárez racial abuse incident in October during a match against Manchester United, in which he racially abused Patrice Evra. He was fined £40,000 and banned for eight games. Dalglish was sacked at the end of the season and replaced by Brendan Rodgers.|$|E

40|$|This study extends {{research}} on the information content of qualified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> in more developed markets to the emerging capital market in China. It investigates the market reaction to <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> of listed Chinese companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A sample of 3128 company/year observations was included, with 386 modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> and 2742 unqualified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> during the investigation period 1999 to 2003. The variable of interest is <b>audit</b> <b>opinions.</b> Control variables include those used in studies of developed countries, such as earnings surprise, concurrent bad news disclosure, audit report delay, leverage, the presence of loss and firm size. Also included are variables controlling for specific Chinese institutional characteristics, such as &# 147;special treatment&# 148;, as well as bull and bear market indicators. When all modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> are combined, this study does not find evidence that the modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> have significant information value to Chinese investors. However, when modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> are classified by type, the market is found to significantly react to qualified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> with explanatory notes and disclaimer <b>audit</b> <b>opinions,</b> which are the severest <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> investigated in this study. When the entire sample is partitioned by year, a significant stock price revision to modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> is documented in 2003. This study also examined in the Chinese context the Melumad and Ziv (1997) model of stock price response to avoidable and unavoidable modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions.</b> Consistent with Melumad and Ziv (1997) predictions, the market reaction to avoidable audit reports is unclear, while investors view unavoidable audit reports as necessarily negative information.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} factors which can affect auditors to issue going concern <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> in the Chinese stock market, and furthermore, {{to discuss the}} audit quality among Chinese reporting system through the issuance of going concern opinions. Firstly, the data results illustrate that Chinese auditors {{are more likely to}} issue going concern <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> to those listed companies with poor profitability, low liquidity, less cash inflows and high leverage. Secondly, it can be examined that audit fee paid by a client has no statistically significant effect on impacting auditors to give going concern <b>audit</b> <b>opinions.</b> Finally, comparing with Big-Four and non-Big four audit firms, no significant difference between two types of auditors on which one have more preference to issue going concern <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> is found. Generally, the research shows a mature audit profession in developing countries like China is being formed, that audit independence is not compromised by economic dependence and the majority of Chinese auditors mainly issue going concern opinions based on financial distress indicators. Besides, this research paper indicates additional discussion about improvements on audit quality and independence since the new audit standard for going concern is promulgated in 2003.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} regulatory sanctions as deterrents to auditors' unethical behavior. Although the effectiveness of formal sanctions is crucial for regulators and policy makers, few empirical studies have addressed the issue. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} formal sanctions in improving auditors' independence. We hypothesize that sanctioned auditors who were criticized for failure to detect and report financial statement frauds act more independently and conservatively by issuing more modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> after being sanctioned. Based on the enforcement releases issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, we identified 27 sanctioned auditors and a matched sample of non-sanctioned auditors. We found that in general, sanctioned auditors issued less modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> than non-sanctioned auditors (control group) but issued more modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> after the enforcement actions than before. Our findings are important for regulators and policy makers in recognizing their efforts in execution of formal sanctions and in encouraging more stringent and frequent checks on auditors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> of listed firms in China vary systematically with the political connections of the firm’s chief executive officer (CEO). Prior literature only shows the importance of political influence to auditor choice and audit quality. Design/methodology/approach: A politically connected firm is defined as a firm in which the CEO has a political background. The authors use a “difference-in-difference” model to control for self-selection problems. Findings: The authors find that the likelihood of receiving a favourable opinion in the subsequent period is positively associated with a CEO’s political connections. This positive association is stronger with CEOs connected to local government within the same region. The authors further find that the CEO’s political connections have more influence on favourable <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> in non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs) in a less developed and lower investor protection region. The influence is also less significant in the regions where there are more non-state-owned or foreign banks and where there are greater penalties for political corruption and relationship-based contracting. Originality/value: The study complements and extends the existing literature on the role of political connections in the economy by providing evidence on the effect of a CEO’s political connections on <b>audit</b> <b>opinions.</b> The authors extend the research on auditing in emerging markets by explicitly accounting for unique institutional and market factors in China. They explore audit quality by observing how <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> are directly shaped by political and institutional factors.

Consistent with this, Chen et al.

Our {{results are consistent with}} downwards earnings management 1 year prior to the bankruptcy-filing. Results also show that (a) firms receiving unqualified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> 4 or 5 years prior to the bankruptcy-filing event manage earnings upwards in subsequent years, consistent with Rosner [2003.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{disentangle}} the relation between GC exception in the Emphasis of Matter of unqualified opinion, modified opinion for GC and the opening of insolvency proceedings. Using a unique hand-collected database on <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> of 326 Italian listed companies from 2007 to 2011, we analyze <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> first using a GLM with fixed effects and then we test our results adopting a hierarchical model with random effects. First, we find that the probability of opening an insolvency proceeding is higher following a modified opinion for GC than after a GC exception in the Emphasis of Matter of an unqualified opinion. Second, we identify a positive and significant relationship between a GC exception reported in the Emphasis of Matter of unqualified opinion at time (t- 1) and a modified opinion for GC at time (t). Overall, the findings suggest that going concern opinions have to be disentangled to really understand the risk of default. Auditors properly perform their monitoring role even if they do not appear to be fully independent in expressing their opinions.

30|$|The audit quality {{literature}} mainly {{investigates the}} determinants of audit quality, especially the supply side, that is, the characteristics of auditors. Yuan and Li (2003) find that auditors have no impact on earnings management, which suggests low audit quality. Consistent with the above evidence, it is also provided that the Big 4 cannot increase audit quality. With corporate tax audits, Chan and Mo (2000) provide evidence that tax audits do not restrain tax noncompliance. Moreover, Liu and Zhou (2007) report that firms with Big 4 auditors exhibit lower earnings conservatism which results from {{the determinants of}} legal risk for audit quality. However, other studies show that earnings management is associated with modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> and <b>audit</b> quality is affected by Big 4 auditors, Big 10 auditors, and audit tenure (Chen and Xia 2006; Liu 2006), implying that reputational concern {{plays an important role}} in audit supply. In addition, some studies focus on the consequences of audit quality and a significantly negative association between modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> and cumulative abnormal returns is provided. As well, Hu and Tang (2007) find consistent evidence with bank loan interest. Evidence is shown that modified <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> are related to change in auditors in the next fiscal year, suggesting that there is opinion shopping incentives among clients.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This study aims {{to examine}} the {{industry}} reaction as determined by stock returns when firms in the electric services industry announced receipt of Going concern <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> from 1984 through 1991. Design/methodology/approach – The study utilizes standard event study methodology to test for significant excess performance. Findings – From 1984 to 1991, going concern opinion (GCO) announcements produce a contagion response in the industry on the announcement date {{more than half the}} time. Also, over the event window of the announcement date plus the five days following, six of the seven announcements were accompanied by significant negative industry reaction. Regression analysis suggests non-announcing a firm's leverage and earnings correlation with the announcing firm significantly impact abnormal returns, as does the exchange on which the announcer's equity is traded, the size of the announcing firm and whether nuclear plant problems were mentioned in the announcement. Research limitations/implications – The findings suggest that <b>audit</b> <b>opinions</b> provide new information for investors in the electric services industry.
