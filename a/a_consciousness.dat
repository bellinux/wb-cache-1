Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> that he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> that transcends the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more questioning and critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
25|$|Stapledon's {{conception}} {{of history is}} based on the Hegelian Dialectic, following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, but {{it is also one of}} progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> composed of many telepathically-linked individuals.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism has no {{traditional}} ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus {{can choose}} to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monistic, or atheistic. Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitrajña (Sanskrit: क्षैत्रज्ञ). It defines spiritual practice as one's journey towards moksha, awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, true nature of reality, and <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> that is liberated and content.|$|E

25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Catalan from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified {{because there has}} been <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (Ausbau) processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most of the}} Jewish {{people during}} this period, {{especially}} the wealthy families, were {{to be found in}} Babylonia, the existence they led there, under the successive rulers of the Achaemenids, the Seleucids, the Parthians, and the Sassanians, was obscure and devoid of political influence. The poorest but most fervent of the exiles returned to Judah / the Land of Israel during the reign of the Achaemenids (c. 550–330 BCE). There, with the reconstructed Temple in Jerusalem as their center, they organized themselves into a community, animated by a remarkable religious ardor and a tenacious attachment to the Torah as the focus of its identity. As this little nucleus increased in numbers with the accession of recruits from various quarters, it awoke to <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> of itself, and strove once again for national independence and political enfranchisement and sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The ordinary, familiar, {{everyday}} {{things and}} occurrences we have, constitute occasions {{for the experience}} of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot. Kedushah, holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The Birkat Ha-Mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed {{in the majority of}} these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a Berakah is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the occasions for experiencing Him, for having <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.|$|E
25|$|The veneration of nats also shares similar {{practices}} with Buddhism. In Buddhism, offerings are extremely common and expected. Shrines and temples, {{in which these}} offerings are to be made, are seen in both Burmese folk religion and Buddhism. In both the faiths, many different statues of various deities {{can also be seen}} around the house. Burmese folk religion differs dramatically in the concept of a soul. Buddhism does not believe in a soul that leaves after one dies, but rather <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> that is transferred to a new person (consciousness is reborn in another). In contrast, Burmese folk religion holds that the soul can leave the body it inhabits. This soul is often depicted {{in the form of a}} butterfly called a leppya. The act of the soul leaving the host often happens in dreams, or when someone is sick or dying. If one is awoken in the middle of their dream, it is said that their soul might not be back to them yet. If a host tries to live without its soul it will die. When someone is dying, butterfly hunts are often held to try to recapture the soul that has wondered off.|$|E

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. <b>A</b> <b>consciousness</b> asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

The English word implies {{internal}} {{awareness of}} a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, as well as <b>a</b> <b>consciousness</b> of our own actions. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined [...] "gut feeling" [...] or [...] "vague sense of guilt" [...] about {{what ought to be}} or should have been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, {{which may or may not}} be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience"). Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a [...] "spark" [...] of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.|$|E

40|$|In this {{philosophical}} thesis, I propose global {{education as}} one approach for fostering global citizenship which, I believe, leads to <b>a</b> global <b>consciousness.</b> This increasingly interconnected and interdependent world calls for <b>a</b> global <b>consciousness</b> {{that not only}} nurtures a sense of caring about global {{as well as local}} and/or national issues, but also encourages contributive action. Once I introduce the rationale and goals for promoting <b>a</b> global <b>consciousness,</b> I then focus on education as one avenue for promoting the global citizenship that is essential for <b>a</b> global <b>consciousness.</b> However, global education faces its own challenges that impede its ability to foster global citizens. I specifically highlight six areas of concern that need to be addressed. To achieve a greater understanding of the complex relationship between citizenship and education, I explore the ideologies of traditional and more contemporary philosophers. Having established the linkage between citizenship, both as a nation-state and global concept, and education, I present a philosophy of education which is rooted in the teacher-student relationship. I advocate this bond as a primary step that leads to the promotion of global education in classrooms. By tying together all my main points in section five, I establish the foundation and steps that foster the emergence of <b>a</b> global <b>consciousness...</b>|$|R
