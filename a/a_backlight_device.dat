50|$|A {{significant}} benefit of OLED displays over traditional liquid crystal displays (LCDs) is that OLEDs {{do not require}} <b>a</b> <b>backlight</b> to function. Thus they draw far less power and, when powered from a battery, can operate longer on the same charge. Because {{there is no need}} for <b>a</b> <b>backlight,</b> <b>an</b> OLED display can be much thinner than an LCD panel.|$|R

40|$|An organic {{light-emitting}} diode (OLED) consists of several semiconducting organic layers sandwiched between two electrodes, {{at least one}} of them being transparent. OLEDs can provide brighter, crisper displays on electronic devices and use less power than conventional {{light-emitting diode}}s (LEDs) or liquid crystal displays (LCDs) used today. OLEDs are made by placing thin films of organic materials between two conductors. When electrical current is applied, a bright light is emitted. The OLED materials emit light and do not require <b>a</b> <b>backlight.</b> Each pixel is a small light-emitting diode, in fact. OLEDs emit light they do not require <b>a</b> <b>backlight</b> and so are thinner and more efficient than LCD displays. In this paper we investigate the different types of OLEDs...|$|R

40|$|A key {{requirement}} {{to obtain a}} uniform luminance for <b>a</b> side-lit LED <b>backlight</b> is the optimized spatial pattern of structures on the light guide that extract the light. The generation of such a scatter pattern is usually performed by applying an iterative approach. In each iteration, the luminance distribu- tion of the <b>backlight</b> with <b>a</b> particular scatter pattern is analyzed. This is typically performed with a brute-force ray-tracing algorithm, although this approach results in a time-consuming optimization process. In this study, the Adding-Doubling method is explored as an alternative way for evaluating the luminance of <b>a</b> <b>backlight.</b> Due to the similarities be- tween light propagating in <b>a</b> <b>backlight</b> with extraction structures and light scattering {{in a cloud of}} light scatterers, the Adding-Doubling method which is used to model the latter could also be used to model the light distribution in <b>a</b> <b>backlight.</b> The backlight problem is translated to a form upon which the Adding-Doubling method is directly applicable. The calculated lumi- nance for a simple uniform extraction pattern with the Adding-Doubling method matches the luminance generated by a commercial raytracer very well. Although successful, no clear computational advantage over ray trac- ers is realized. However, the dynamics of light propagation in a light guide as used the Adding-Doubling method, also allow to enhance the efficiency of brute-force ray-tracing algorithms. The performance of this enhanced ray-tracing ap- proach for the simulation of backlights is also evaluated against a typical brute-force ray-tracing approach. status: accepte...|$|R
