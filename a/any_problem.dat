5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without <b>any</b> <b>problem.</b> In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E

5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how his theory {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to <b>any</b> <b>problem.</b> Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of <b>any</b> <b>problem,</b> or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for <b>any</b> <b>problem,</b> quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decision}} was made at the 83rd FIDE Congress in September 2012 in Istanbul. Out of the three bidding cities, the applications of Albena and Tallinn were not accepted as they both failed to make presentations before the voting. Thereafter, discussions started about Baku's nomination and two concerns were raised. The first was the protest by the Armenian representatives against holding the Olympiad in Azerbaijan, who stated that the Armenian chess players would {{find it difficult to}} play in Baku, since the two nations were in armed conflict. The second concern was related to the difficulties that the participants may have in obtaining a visa to enter the country. In his speech during the congress, Azerbaijani Minister of Youth and Sports Azad Rahimov said that Armenian sportsmen had already visited Azerbaijan and participated in competitions, where they were provided with security guarantees that had been met, and no incident was ever recorded. He also mentioned the victory of Russian Armenian boxer Misha Aloyan in the 2011 AIBA World Boxing Championships held in Baku as an example that Armenians can not only participate but also win. With regard to the visa issue, Rahimov mentioned the positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants received their visas on arrival at the airport without <b>any</b> <b>problem.</b> He also added that the Armenian sportsmen will also get visas easily. The next speaker was FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who suggested that the 42nd Chess Olympiad should take place in Baku and mentioned that there are four years for the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict to be resolved before the event.|$|E
25|$|Top-down approach: This is {{the direct}} {{fall-out}} of the recursive formulation of <b>any</b> <b>problem.</b> If {{the solution to}} <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table {{to see if it}} is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the late}} Roman military, many {{recruits}} and even officers had barbarian origins, and soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields. Some scholars {{have seen this}} {{as an indication of}} weakness; others disagree, seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army.|$|E
25|$|The Yu-Gi-Oh! manga {{is written}} and {{illustrated}} by Kazuki Takahashi. It was originally serialized in Japan in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from Shueisha from 1996's issue 42 to 2004. The plot follows the story of a boy named Yugi Mutou who is given the ancient Millennium Puzzle, and awakes an alter-ego within his body, who helps him with <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> he is having using various games.|$|E

25|$|The proof {{shows that}} <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in NP {{can be reduced}} in {{polynomial}} time (in fact, logarithmic space suffices) to an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem. This means that if the Boolean satisfiability problem could be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, then all problems in NP could be solved in polynomial time, and so the complexity class NP would be equal to the complexity class P.|$|E
25|$|Integral linear {{programs}} are of central {{importance in the}} polyhedral aspect of combinatorial optimization since they provide an alternate characterization of a problem. Specifically, for <b>any</b> <b>problem,</b> the convex hull of the solutions is an integral polyhedron; if this polyhedron has a nice/compact description, then we can efficiently find the optimal feasible solution under any linear objective. Conversely, if we can prove that a linear programming relaxation is integral, then it is the desired description of the convex hull of feasible (integral) solutions.|$|E
25|$|For {{instance}}, the Boolean satisfiability {{problem is}} NP-complete by the Cook‚ÄìLevin theorem, so any instance of <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in NP {{can be transformed}} mechanically into an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem {{is one of many}} such NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P = NP. However, many important problems {{have been shown to be}} NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.|$|E

25|$|Economics is {{a social}} science which studies the production, distribution, trade, and {{consumption}} of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: microeconomics, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers {{the economy as a}} whole, in which case it considers aggregate supply and demand for money, capital and commodities. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are resource allocation, production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic value.|$|E

Mexico has a non-discriminatory policy {{with regard to the}} grant of its citizenship. The spouse of a Mexican national would generally not face <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> in acquiring local citizenship. But although quite a few NRIs have married Mexicans, they have retained their Indian citizenship.|$|E
