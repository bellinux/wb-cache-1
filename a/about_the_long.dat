25|$|Even {{before the}} third station opened, there were doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term {{viability}} of passenger rail services between Lyttelton and Christchurch. The Lyttelton road tunnel would soon become a reality, providing {{a much more}} convenient road link between Lyttelton Harbour and the Canterbury Plains. This was expected to enable the growth of road transport as a serious competitor to the railways for the custom of passengers, and concerns were expressed that given this state of affairs, a new station for Lyttelton could not be justified. Despite this, the Minister of Railways John McAlpine announced on 7 August 1962 that the Cabinet had approved a redevelopment of the railway facilities at Lyttelton.|$|E

25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there is a crisis of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E
25|$|CANDU fuel bundles {{are about}} a half meter long and 10cm in diameter. They consist of {{sintered}} (UO2) pellets in zirconium alloy tubes, welded to zirconium alloy end plates. Each bundle is roughly 20kg, and a typical core loading is {{on the order of}} 4500-6500 bundles, depending on the design. Modern types typically have 37 identical fuel pins radially arranged <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> axis of the bundle, but in the past several different configurations and numbers of pins have been used. The CANFLEX bundle has 43 fuel elements, with two element sizes. It is also about 10cm (4inches) in diameter, 0.5 m (20in) long and weighs about 20kg (44lb) and replaces the 37-pin standard bundle. It has been designed specifically to increase fuel performance by utilizing two different pin diameters. Current CANDU designs do not need enriched uranium to achieve criticality (due to their more efficient heavy water moderator), however, some newer concepts call for low enrichment to help reduce the size of the reactors.|$|E

[...] After Conrad died in 2010, {{the city of}} Santa Monica began to reevaluate the structural integrity of the sculpture. In June 2011, an inspector observed children climbing the sculpture. [...] Safety tests were performed showing that the underlying structure built using fiberglass and copper chains was stable. [...] However, questions were raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term integrity of [...] the fiberglass. An inspection found rust and corrosion on the steel frame skeleton and the revealed that the anchor bolts holding the sculpture to the base were weakened. Shortly after the inspection, the city installed a safety fence around the sculpture to protect the public.|$|E
40|$|The {{statistics}} of rotational motion of small, inertialess triaxial ellipsoids are computed along Lagrangian trajectories extracted from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The particle angular velocity and its components along the three principal axes of the particle are considered, expanding {{on the results}} presented by ChevillardMeneveau 13. The variance of the particle angular velocity, {{referred to as the}} particle enstrophy, is found to increase for particles with elongated shapes. This trend is explained by considering the contributions of vorticity and strain-rate to particle rotation. It is found that the majority of particle enstrophy is due to fluid vorticity. Strain-rate-induced rotations, which are sensitive to shape, are mostly cancelled by strain-vorticity interactions. The remainder of the strain-rate-induced rotations are responsible for weak variations in particle enstrophy. For particles of all shapes, the majority of the enstrophy is in rotations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> axis, which is due to alignment between <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> axis and fluid vorticity. The integral timescale for particle angular velocities about each axis reveals that rotations are most persistent <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> axis, but that a full revolution is rare...|$|R

James M.

[...] A few newspapers published articles <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> flights, but no reporters or photographers had been there.

500|$|The {{development}} {{team found}} that players experienced greater freedom when controlling three characters in missions. Lead mission designer Imran Sarwar felt they opened up more strategic manoeuvres. He cited a combat scenario with the lead protagonists where Michael De Santa sets up at a sniper outpost and provides covering fire for Trevor Philips, {{who makes a}} frontal assault on the enemy position while Franklin Clinton manipulates flank points. Benzies felt that character switching streamlines the interplay between free roam and linear mission gameplay, as it eliminates San Andreas cumbersome long distance drives to mission start points. Players may [...] "explore the whole map without having to worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> drive back", according to Benzies. Houser noted the mechanic's use during missions negated long drives as well. The open world's dynamic mission content is a feature borrowed from Red Dead Redemption, where it was received positively. Dynamic missions present themselves while players explore the open world, and may be accepted or ignored. The team implemented dynamic content all throughout the open world. In Los Santos for example, players may encounter an armoured van and try to intercept it to steal its contents.|$|E
500|$|Forty-nine crews {{registered}} {{to compete in}} the rally, Of the top-tier drivers entered, Jean-Marie Cuoq was the only WRC rookie, and Chris Atkinson, Henning Solberg, and Matthew Wilson had driven at Monte Carlo only once before, all in 2006. The starting order for Leg 1 was [...] "Priority 1" [...] (P1) and P2 WRC drivers in the order of the final classification of the 2006 season, followed by all other drivers as decided by the ACM. Loeb, the previous season's champion, set off first, followed by Grönholm, then Mikko Hirvonen. Loeb and Grönholm were the favourites to win; Loeb had won the Monte Carlo three times in a row between 2003 and 2005, and Grönholm had won in 2006. Nevertheless, there were worries that Loeb would not be physically fit enough to win. Four months earlier he had broken his left shoulder in a mountain-biking accident, and there was a chance he might not even compete {{in the first part of}} the season. His physiotherapists and consultants told him that because of the operations he had had on his arm, he should definitely have sat out the Monte Carlo Rally. Loeb admitted that he was [...] "really stressed" [...] before the start, and wondered whether his arm would be okay.

2500|$|From the {{opposite}} angle, Romanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} Malthus was too optimistic, as he failed to recognize any upper limit {{to the growth of}} population — only, the geometric increase in human numbers is occasionally slowed down (checked) by the arithmetic increase in agricultural produce, according to Malthus' simple growth model; but some upper limit to population is bound to exist, as the total amount of agricultural land — actual as well as potential — on Earth is finite, Georgescu-Roegen points out. Georgescu-Roegen further argues that the industrialised world's increase in agricultural productivity since Malthus' day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Political advisor Jeremy Rifkin and ecological economist Herman Daly, two students of Georgescu-Roegen, have raised similar neo-Malthusian concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} genre elements, Damon Lindelof has stated that, [...] "We sort of suckered people into this show [...] not {{presenting}} it {{as a science}} fiction show {{right out of the}} gate … Lost has really been <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> con, because {{by the time we get}} to season 6, it's going to be...crazy!"s Past and Future]", IGN. [...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known what we were going to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox. [...] Paradox creates issues." [...] Actor Terry O'Quinn has divulged that [...] "it is revealed who Locke actually is. [...] Although that's still kind of a mystery of who is that.
