These traditional mathematical models often don’t consider topography, transport conditions, slop etc. The distance between two nodes is often assumed for the straight line in this model, so the analytical result usually can not be used as a warehouse in actual applied. So the paper isn’t only takes a catena supermarket warehouse as an example and adopts the geographical information system (GIS) technology, spatial analysis methods and remote sensing images to establish warehouse selection model of logistics distribution, but also improves P-median selecting location model. At the same time, the most suitable warehouse location is determined by multi-standards. The method mainly includes three processes: building networks, handling remote sensing and overlapping networks to remote images. Since the networks ’ distance is used in the model, the analysis result is more science and more close to reality.

Of specific interest were the influences of complex and simple <b>assistance</b> on <b>decision</b> performance and decision maker attitudes. Our findings suggest that performance and user attitudes can be enhanced by technology that provides clear and simple instruction in good problem-solving practices.

40|$|Abstract Background and Purpose The {{topic of}} this study is about how {{municipal}} leaders perceive their role in assistance provisioning decisions in which the services are organized as user-controlled personal assistance (UPA) for adults with mental retardation, who can not be the supervisor of its UPA arrangement. Municipalities have the primary responsibility to provide appropriate services or assistance to people with mental retardation. The purpose {{of this study}} is to focus on the municipal leadership role in assistance provisioning decisions for people with mental retardation. Municipal officials have to determine what assistance services the specific user gets, and each municipality is academically responsible for the assistance services offered. In May 2000 UPA were incorporated in the Social Services Act and municipalities are required to have UPA in their repertoire of services. The act is described there as an alternative organization of practical and personal help for people who are severely mentally retarded. In the last ten years there has been a continuous growth in recipients of UPA, from nearly 700 in 2000 to more than 2, 500 in 2009. How many of the 2, 500 who belong to the group of mentally disabled, who are the target group in this study, is not quantified. The scope and increase of the usergroup can say something about municipal leaders’ challenges, which may be based on management processes, the formulation and implementation of this assistance provisioning decision. Method The study describes a qualitative approach with semi-structured interviews of eight mid-level managers in four different municipalities in Norway. As a tool of analysis systematic text condensation is used, as described by Malterud (2011), before the findings are presented and further relates to theoretical perspectives and previous research findings. Findings The findings show variation in perception of leadership in assistance provision decisions organized as UPA. Findings show that the perception of the leader role may be related to the employer model municipality has chosen for its UPA. Descriptions of findings is divided into the following topics: Investigation prior to the formal decision, executive insight into the effectuation of the <b>assistance</b> <b>decision,</b> the academic responsibilities role, to be ruled by economics and efficiency considerations and managers training responsibilities. Summary Municipal leaders perceive their role in user-controlled personal assistance differently, but agree that structural adaptation to the user group may be required for securing satisfactory services in the future.

Sophisticated descriptions store information about shape oriented engineering objects and their relationships. Boundary repre-sentations of form features constitute shape models.

This change of modeling facili-tates a next step towards application of computer intelligence at engineering object related decisions.

This method provides quick and comprehensive assessment of situations for decisions on modi-fication of modeled objects in very complex information environments.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} {{expose the}} fact that poverty, race, gender, and other indicators of social disadvantage {{are linked to the}} population of citizens who struggle the most to recover after a disaster, yet these factors are not accounted for in public policy that guides decision making related to federal assistance to residents affected by a disaster. This study used neural networks as a research strategy to determine whether the current policies under the Stafford Act related to assistance comply with Congressional intent and law that uses a formula for assistance distribution, and whether human factors such as culture, measured as residing in a non-white zip code according to Census tract data, are considered in <b>decision</b> making regarding <b>assistance.</b> Data from FEMA related to the recovery from Hurricane Irene in 2011 were used {{as the basis for the}} model. The neural network analysis of this study indicated that federal <b>assistance</b> <b>decisions</b> after the Hurricane Irene event tended to focus on the adjusted property value and actual dollar value of losses as the determining factor in decisions. Focusing on the actual dollar value of losses is consistent with the formulaic approach codified in public law, but this approach overshadows important human factors such as living in a primarily non-white zip code and the availability of temporary housing. This study underscores the notion that the public policy works the way it is intended, but it fails to accommodate human and social factors. As a consequence, the existing policy is legally equitable, but it is not necessarily morally fair to those impacted by disasters. The positive social change implications of this study include recommendations to federal policy makers to more equitably structure recovery efforts in alignment with the human environment of communities rather than a primary focus on cost and value of real property...|$|R
