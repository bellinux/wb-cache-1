Calculating the dimensions of the river bank protection structure Batang Lubuh using basic assumptions of type W and land use pressure Coulomb theory. And discussion of the results obtained huge security dimension Lubuh Batang river bluff with concrete sheet pile type using W- 300 - 1000 Kobe types with a length of 12 meters, a width of 99. 6 cm and 30 cm tall or thick. <b>Armature</b> <b>rod</b> used is made of steel diameter 3. 5 inch or 8. 89 cm with a length of 15 meters.
