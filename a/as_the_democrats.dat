5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> took control of the House and slashed the Republican majority in the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In 1852 Morton campaigned and {{was elected}} {{to serve as a}} circuit court judge, but {{resigned}} after only a year; he found that he preferred to practice law. By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics. Initially, Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat, but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation. Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise's ban on slavery in the western territories, beyond Missouri, had a divisive effect on both parties. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> divided over the issue, Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act. Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright, the state's Democrats expel its anti-slavery members, including Morton, from the Indiana state convention in 1854. That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People's party, the forerunner to the state's Republican party.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats {{lost control of}} the House in 1881, and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control of the House in 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E

50|$|After his {{discharge}} from the Army, Rodgers returned home to Illinois and focused on farming and his growing family, which eventually included two sons and two daughters. Rodgers was nominated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> party’s nominee for Madison County Clerk in 1865, but lost. In 1870 he was nominated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> candidate for <b>the</b> Illinois House of Representatives and won. In 1896 he was Mayor of Upper Alton, which has since been incorporated in the larger city of Alton. Rodgers died on 20 January 1922 {{at the age of}} ninety-four.|$|R
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were blamed for gerrymandering him out of his seat.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were {{grappling}} {{with their own}} troubles, leaders in the Republican party fought to keep elected members focused {{on the issue of}} slavery in the West, which allowed them to mobilize popular support. Chase wrote Sumner that if the conservatives succeeded, it might be necessary to recreate the Free Soil Party. He was also particularly disturbed by the tendency of many Republicans to eschew moral attacks on slavery for political and economic arguments.|$|E

25|$|When the Majority Leader's party loses {{control of}} the House, and if the Speaker and Majority Leader both remain in the {{leadership}} hierarchy, convention suggests that they would become the Minority Leader and Minority Whip, respectively. As the minority party has one less leadership position after losing the speaker's chair, {{there may be a}} contest for the remaining leadership positions. Nancy Pelosi is the most recent example of an outgoing Speaker seeking the Minority Leader post to retain the House party leadership, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> lost {{control of the}} House in the 2010 elections. She ran successfully for Minority Leader in the 112th Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} year was tumultuous; it {{was marked by}} the assassination of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., subsequent King assassination riots across the nation, the assassination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses. Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had won a landslide victory for the Democratic Party four years earlier, declined to seek re-election amid growing discontent over the Vietnam War and his worse-than-expected showing in the New Hampshire primary. The 1968 Democratic National Convention was a scene of violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> split into multiple factions.|$|E
25|$|In the {{shifting}} political combinations of the time, Causey {{began his career}} as a progressive Jacksonian Democrat, and was elected to the State House in the 1831 session and the 1832/33 session. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> lost their progressive agenda, and with the collapse of the Whig Party, most of the energy in opposition to the increasingly conservative Democrats came from the Temperance movement. In 1850 a Temperance candidate was almost elected, and in 1854 Causey signed on as their candidate under the aegis of the American Party. This was an unusual combination of various causes that in Delaware was headed by prohibition. He was elected Governor of Delaware in 1854, defeating William Burton, the Democratic candidate and served from January 16, 1855 until January 18, 1859.|$|E
50|$|On June 4, 2013, Governor Chris Christie {{announced}} that a special election to fill the vacant Senate seat {{will be held on}} October 16, 2013.

He was {{defeated}} in that race by Independent candidate Bob Ziegelbauer. Ziegelbauer won with 50% of the vote (9697 votes), while Trask managed 33% of the vote (6458). The Republican candidate, Andrew Wisniewski, collected 17% of the votes.|$|R
25|$|Dean's {{strategy}} arguably {{paid off}} in a historic victory <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> took {{over control of the}} House of Representatives and the Senate in the 2006 mid-term elections. While it is likely this is also attributable to the shortcomings of the Republican Party in their dealings with the Iraq War and the scandals that occurred shortly before the election, Dean's emphasis on connecting with socially conservative, economic moderates in Republican-dominated states appears to have made some impact. Indeed, Democratic candidates won elections in such red states as Kansas, Indiana, and Montana. And while former Clinton strategist James Carville criticized Dean's efforts, saying more seats could have been won with the traditional plan of piling money solely into close races, the results and the strategy were met with tremendous approval by the party's executive committee in its December 2006 meeting. While he was chairman of the DCCC, Rahm Emanuel was known to have had disagreements over election strategy with Dean; Emanuel believed a more tactical approach, focusing attention on key districts, was necessary to ensure victory. Emanuel himself was criticised for his failure to support some progressive candidates, as Dean advocated.|$|E

Hamilton (the brother of her 1951 opponent) by 457 votes, with 520 votes going to a third-party candidate, J. Warren Keel. Speaking later of her electoral defeat, Dallas said [...] "I said I couldn't put my organization above my constituents. Now that makes me sound pious and goody-goody, but I couldn't—so I got defeated." [...] She did not run for elected office again.|$|E

500|$|Harrison was the Northern Whig {{candidate}} for president in 1836, {{one of only two}} times in American history when a major political party intentionally ran more than one presidential candidate (the Democrats ran two candidates in 1860). Vice President Martin Van Buren, the Democratic candidate, was popular and deemed likely to win the election against an individual Whig candidate. The Whig plan was to elect popular Whigs regionally, deny Van Buren the 148 electoral votes needed for election, and force the House of Representatives to decide the election. They hoped the Whigs would control the House after the general elections. (This strategy would have failed, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> retained a majority in the House following the election.) ...|$|E
500|$|In 1896, {{a presidential}} {{election}} year, Davenport was sent to Washington to meet and study some of the Republican Party's potential candidates, such as Speaker of the House Thomas B. Reed. Hearst's Journal was a Democratic paper, and Davenport {{would be expected to}} harshly caricature the Republican presidential candidate. The Republicans were anxious to take over the White House from Democrat Grover Cleveland; they were widely expected to do so, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were blamed for the economic Panic of 1893, which had brought depression to the nation for the past three years. [...] None of the potential Democratic candidates seemed particularly formidable, and the Republican nominee was expected to win in a landslide.|$|E
500|$|With the Democrats {{unable to}} agree on a single presidential candidate, the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago became crucial, as the nominee would be in a {{favorable}} position to become president. Prominent figures in the party such as Seward and Lincoln sought the nomination. [...] Stevens continued to support the 75-year-old Justice McLean. Beginning on the second ballot, most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln, helping to win the Illinoisan the nomination. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> put up no candidate in his district, Stevens was assured of reelection to the House, and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania. Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College. [...] The President-elect's known opposition to the expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states, a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign.|$|E

500|$|Jackson's adherents {{were from}} the old Democratic-Republican Party and {{eventually}} became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Stevens {{had been told by}} fellow attorney (and future president) James Buchanan that he could advance politically if he joined them, but Stevens could not support Jackson, out of principle. [...] For Stevens, Anti-Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred [...] "cripples" [...] from joining. Stevens took to Anti-Masonry with enthusiasm, and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause. His biographer, Hans Trefousse, suggested that another reason for Stevens's virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair (he thereafter wore wigs, often ill-fitting), and [...] "the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons.” ...|$|E
500|$|The Whig {{candidate}} was General Scott, whom Pierce had served under in Mexico; {{his running mate}} was Secretary of the Navy William A. Graham. The Whigs could not unify their factions <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable {{from that of the}} Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, {{at the expense of the}} Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen voter turnout in the election to its lowest level since 1836; it was, according to Pierce biographer Peter A. Wallner, [...] "one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history". Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for the candidate and platform; New-York Tribune editor Horace Greeley summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, [...] "we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it".|$|E
500|$|The {{night of}} June 11–12, 1920 would become famous in {{political}} {{history as the}} night of the [...] "smoke-filled room", in which, legend has it, party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding. Historians have focused on the talks held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Will Hays at the Blackstone Hotel, at which senators and others came and went, and numerous possible candidates were discussed. Utah Senator Reed Smoot, before his departure early in the evening, backed Harding, telling Hays and the others that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were likely to nominate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio. Smoot also told The New York Times that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding, but {{that it would not be}} done for several ballots yet. This was not true: a number of participants backed Harding (others supported his rivals), but there was no pact to nominate him, and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement. Two other participants in the smoke-filled room discussions, Kansas Senator Charles Curtis and Colonel George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a close friend of Hays, predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates.|$|E
