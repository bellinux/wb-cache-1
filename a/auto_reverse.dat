50|$|Power {{consumption}} was low, requiring only {{either one}} AA battery or one gumstick-type rechargeable, with optional AC adaptor input. It is also {{equipped with an}} amorphous tape head capable of reproducing 20-20,000 Hz response, a gold-plated headphone jack, and a 2-millimetre-thick aluminum body. Sony made this model with only sound quality in mind at an affordable price, therefore it contains no gimmick features such as in-line remote control, music search, or LCD readout. Its only features are Dolby B/C noise reduction, EX DBB bass boost, tape and two <b>auto</b> <b>reverse</b> modes.|$|E
5000|$|In later <b>auto</b> <b>reverse</b> machines, the [...] "auto reverse" [...] {{mechanism}} uses {{an ordinary}} two-track, quarter-width head, but operates by mechanically rotating the head 180 degrees {{so that the}} two head gaps access the other tracks of the tape. There is usually an azimuth adjustment screw for each position. Nevertheless, due to the repeated movement, the alignment (in particular, the azimuth) deviates with usage. Even in a machine with a four channel head, slight asymmetries in the cassette shell {{make it difficult to}} align the head perfectly for both directions.|$|E
5000|$|This late 90s {{model of}} {{combination}} player included several new features. Including both side play (<b>auto</b> <b>reverse),</b> digital audio outputs, S-Video outputs, component video outputs. This model {{had a good}} selling point as the European (PAL) and North American (NTSC) models could play both NTSC and PAL region LaserDiscs freely [...] The LaserDisc play quality is average but is superior to the other mid range and low end models produced in the early '90s. Noise level is low and image is sharp and stable. DVD play quality is however not even catching up to the cheaper DVD players that can buy at discount stores today.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{models have}} {{overcome}} {{many of these}} disadvantages with Auto-Feed Plus invented by Kurt Snider Published October 2000 Tree and landscape equipment trader magazine this digitally controlled Tachometer <b>Auto</b> <b>reverses</b> the hydraulic feed wheels. The reversible feed system allows the newer style drum chippers to handle larger diameter materials. Modern drum-style chippers usually have a material capacity of 6 to 20 inches (15-50 cm).|$|R
5000|$|Called [...] "UDAR" [...] for UniDirectional <b>Auto</b> <b>Reverse.</b> Used on the Nakamichi RX {{series of}} decks. With {{the advent of}} {{auto-reverse}} (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that {{the angle of the}} tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightlyâ€”a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck. It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.|$|E
40|$|Bladder rupture {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. It is classified into traumatic, nontraumatic or idiopathic and spontaneous. The nonspecific initial clinical presentation is followed by discomfort in the lower abdomen, oliguria, hematuria and ascitis. Laboratory abnormalities simulate the picture of acute renal failure and occurs by a mechanism called <b>auto</b> <b>reverse</b> dialysis, with absorption of excreta through the peritoneal membrane. The authors describe a case of bladder rupture in morphologically and functionally normal urinary bladder associated with alcohol intake in young healthy man, manifested by abdominal discomfort, pseudo renal failure and massive ascitis. The diagnosis was made by an abdominal multidetector computed tomography confirmed by the finding of 7 cm laceration at laparotomy...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{dissolving}} agents on {{the accuracy of}} an electronic apex locator- (EAL-) integrated endodontic handpiece during retreatment procedures were evaluated. The true lengths (TLs) of 56 extracted incisor teeth were determined visually. Twenty teeth were filled with gutta-percha and a resin-based sealer (group A), 20 with gutta-percha and a zinc oxide/eugenol-based sealer (group B), and 16 roots were used as the control group (group C). All roots were prepared to TL. Guttasolv, Resosolv, and Endosolv E were used as the dissolving solutions. Two evaluations of the handpiece were performed: the apical accuracy during the <b>auto</b> <b>reverse</b> function (ARL) and the apex locator function (EL) alone. The ARL function of the handpiece gave acceptable results. There were {{significant differences between the}} EL mode measurements and the TL (P< 0. 05). In these comparisons, Tri Auto ZX EL mode measurements were significantly shorter than those of the TL...|$|E
