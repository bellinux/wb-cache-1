5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> or one <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E

5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
40|$|Background: Taekwondo is {{an empty}} hand combat that entails {{the use of}} the whole body. Spinning and turning kicks are the proper way of kicking in taekwondo which allow one to maximally perform the hip {{abductor}} and <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> simultaneously. To measure the hip abductor and <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of Taekwondo and Non-taekwondo practitioners, Hand-Held Dynamometer (HHD) is used. This study aimed to compare the hip abductor and <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> strength in Taekwondo and Non-taekwondo practitioners. Methods: This analytical study of paired continuous variable was conducted using cross-sectional method. Thirty-two subjects were examined from September−October 2014 at the skills laboratory of Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran. Sixteen of them were Taekwondo practitioner and the other sixteen of them were Non-Taekwondo practitioner. Gender, weight, height, Body Mass Index (BMI) and maximum strength of hip abductor and <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were examined by using Hand-Held Dynamometer (HHD). Results: Off all physical characteristics being examined, it showed that the p-values were above 0. 5. The independent t-test showed that the average strength of hip abductors and <b>adductors</b> <b>muscle</b> in Taekwondo and Non-taekwondo practitioners were significantly different in which the both p-values were less than 0. 05. Conclusions: The maximum strength of hip abductor and <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of Taekwondo and Non-taekwondo practitioners were significantly different. The strength of hip abductors and <b>adductors</b> <b>muscles</b> is greater in Taekwondo practitioners compared to Non-taekwondo practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The hip {{dislocation}} {{especially in}} spastic form of cerebral palsy frequently occurs. It results in significant morbidity {{in terms of}} pain in the dislocated hip and destabilization of the pelvis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the migration percentage in patients where only tenotomies of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were performed compared to patients where tenotomies of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 50 patients (80 hips) divided in two groups. In 32 patients (47 hips) tenotomies of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were performed, in 18 patients (33 hips) tenotomies of the adductormuscles were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve in order to prevent and to decrease the incidence of hip dislocation. We used the Reimers’ hip migration percentage to evaluate the stability of the articulation. Results: In the group where tenotomies of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were combined with neurectomy of the obturator nerve, we cannot find a statistically significant difference when compared to the group where only tenotomies of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> were performed. In the two year follow up period after the operations, a decrease of the migration percentage was noted in both groups of patients with gradual increase in the following period.

50|$|So called {{adductor}} tenotomy (cutting {{the origin}} tendons of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of the thigh) and obturator neurectomy (cutting the anterior {{branch of the}} obturator nerve) is sometimes performed on children with cerebral palsy. These children often have hypertonia of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles,</b> making abduction difficult, obstructing normal hip development, and putting them at risk of hip luxation.|$|R
5|$|Hašek played {{increasingly}} {{well for}} the Senators up until the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the Czech National team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> while making a save in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing {{him to leave the}} game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle,</b> and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle.</b> These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
5000|$|When the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> relax, {{the valves}} {{of the shell}} are {{automatically}} pulled open to some extent by a ligament, which joins the valves together and which is usually located on the hinge line between the umbos of the shell. The resiliency of the ligament is what causes the valves of the bivalve mollusk to open when the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> relax.|$|R

5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the regular}} season success, the team entered the playoffs under a cloud. In February, Hasek had {{suffered}} an <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for the Senators again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had {{to take over the}} starting goaltender duties, leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5000|$|In human anatomy, {{the groin}} (the {{adjective}} is inguinal, as in inguinal canal) is the junctional area (also {{known as the}} inguinal region) between the abdomen and the thigh {{on either side of}} the pubic bone. This is also known as the medial compartment of the thigh that consists of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of the hip or the groin muscles. A pulled groin muscle usually refers to a painful injury sustained by straining the hip <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> of the jaw {{appears to}} have {{attached}} to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably {{would not have been able}} to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the true}} oysters (family Ostreidae), {{scallops}} {{have a single}} central <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle,</b> thus the inside of their shells has a characteristic central scar, marking the point of attachment for this muscle. The <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> of scallops is larger and more developed than those of oysters, because scallops are active swimmers; some species of scallops are known to move en masse from one area to another. In scallops, the shell shape tends to be highly regular, and is commonly used as an archetypal form of a seashell.|$|E
25|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} {{temperature}} and food availability have shown to affect muscle metabolic capabilities. The properties of mitochondria from the phasic <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> of Euvola ziczac varied significantly during their annual reproductive cycle. Summer scallops in May have lower maximal oxidative capacities and substrate oxidation {{than any other}} times in the year. This phenomenon is due to lower protein levels in adductor muscles.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the pattern of}} muscle activation of the individual hip <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> using a standardised simulated unilateral weight-bearing task. Design: A repeated measures design. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: 20 healthy individuals (11 females, 9 males) participated in the study. Age ranged from 20 to 25 years. Main outcome measurements: Surface electromyography recordings from adductor magnus and <b>adductor</b> longus <b>muscles</b> were taken at levels representing 10 - 50 % of body weight during a simulated weight-bearing task. Electromyography (EMG) data were normalised to maximal voluntary isometric contraction. Results: The adductor magnus was recruited at significantly higher levels than the <b>adductor</b> longus <b>muscle</b> during a simulated weight-bearing task performed across 10 - 50 % of body weight (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Adductor magnus and <b>adductor</b> longus <b>muscles</b> are recruited to different extents during a simulated weight-bearing task. This information should be considered when selecting exercises for management and prevention of groin strains. Closed chain exercises with weight-bearing through the lower limb {{are more likely to}} recruit the <b>adductor</b> magnus <b>muscle</b> over the <b>adductor</b> longus <b>muscle...</b>|$|R
50|$|Several {{of these}} lesions may occur simultaneously. Also, many athletes have {{concomitant}} weakness or tearing of the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> or labral tears of the hip.When the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> are tight post injury, {{that can be}} enough to trigger symptoms. The first conservative treatment option should be to restore normal motion after the adductor has begun to heal (usually 6-8 weeks post injury). Sleeping in a prone position with the hip on the affected side flexed and externally rotated can be a cure in some individuals.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of a bivalve mollusk contract, {{the valves}} close, which {{compresses}} the ligament. When the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> relax again, the elastic resiliency of the ligament reopens the shell. Scallops (Pectinidae) swim {{through the water}} column by rapidly and repeatedly clapping (opening and closing) their valves. An interesting fact about scallops swimming in this manner is that they recover {{a greater percentage of}} the work (as defined by physics) performed through the elasticity of their abductin than do other bivalves (which are more sedentary clams).|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to their gills, oysters can also exchange gases across their mantles, which are lined with many small, thin-walled blood vessels. A small, three-chambered heart, lying under the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle,</b> pumps colorless blood to {{all parts of the}} body. At the same time, two kidneys, located {{on the underside of the}} muscle, remove waste products from the blood. Their nervous system includes two pairs of nerve cords and three pairs of ganglia.|$|E

Tsonga took part in Wimbledon, where he lost in the quarterfinals to the second seed Andy Murray in five sets, after holding three set points in the first set and having a break point at the start of the final set.|$|E
25|$|Like the gorgonopsids {{and many}} cynodonts, most therocephalians were presumably carnivores. The earlier therocephalians were, in many respects, as {{primitive}} as the gorgonopsids, {{but they did}} show certain advanced features. There is an enlargement of the temporal opening for broader jaw <b>adductor</b> <b>muscle</b> attachment and a reduction of the phalanges (finger and toe bones) to the mammalian phalangeal formula. The presence of an incipient secondary palate in advanced therocephalians is another feature shared with mammals. The discovery of maxilloturbinal ridges in forms such as the primitive therocephalian Glanosuchus, suggests {{that at least some}} therocephalians may have been warm-blooded.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> of bivalves have a remarkably strong power {{to close the}} shells, and it can easily be inferred that there exist some proper mutual relations between the shells and {{the arrangement of the}} <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> in opening and closing the valves so effectively. To solve this problem from the viewpoint of dynamics, the following two ways can be suggested. A). Research of the nature and relative position of the two components of the muscle,i. e. smooth muscle and striated muscle. B). Research of the dispositions of the anterior and posterior <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles</b> in relation to the whole system of the shell. Up to the present no systematic explanation has been given to these points. In dealing with this subject it is first of all necessary to determine the line of hinge axis that roles as the rotation axis of the shell movement, and then to proceed {{to the question of the}} movement itself. Having measured the hinge axis of several kinds of bivalves, the author found that these axes did not always indicate a constant line but a variable one. The author named the latter 2 ̆ 2 variable hinge axis”. The mechanism of this variable hinge axis is made possible by the conjugated function of the ligament and the <b>adductor</b> <b>muscles.</b> 二枚貝の開閉殻運動は閉殻筋及び蝶番軸にある靭帯によって行われている．閉殻筋に就てはカキ，ホタテガイ等は殻のほぼ中心に 1 個を有するが，アサリ，ハマグリ，シオフキ等は殻の前後に各々 1 個宛計 2 個を有している．又靭帯に就ては構造上，形態上から色々の種類が挙げられる．何れにせよ此の両者の相互作用によつて開閉殻運動が行われるのであるが，此の開殻力及び閉殻力は非常に大きいもので古来注目されて来た所であるにも拘らずその力を計測した人は少く閉殻筋の張力に就てはVaillant，Plateau，Marceau，田村等，又靭帯の開殻力に就てはPlateau，Bayliss，Boyland & Ritchie，田村等の諸氏によつて研究されているに過ぎない．之等の報告の内Marceauによって明らかにされた閉殻筋の力を第 1 票に示す...|$|R
