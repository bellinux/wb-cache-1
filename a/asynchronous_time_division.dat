40|$|Abstract—Synchronous optical packet {{buffering}} {{is presented}} as a solution for <b>asynchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiplexed (TDM) opti-cal packet switched networks. Truly asynchronous optical packet synchronization and buffering are demonstrated using multiple in-dependent transmitters, synchronous optical buffers, and a burst mode receiver. Optical packet synchronizers are used to dynam-ically align incoming asynchronous packets to local timeslots for synchronous loading of buffers. Multiple optical buffers based on integrated InP technology resolve contention of packets destined for the same output port at the same time. TDM asynchronous op-tical packets are detected on a per packet basis using a burst mode receiver with better than 99. 9 % packet recovery. An analysis of power consumption of the synchronous buffers is presented and potential power reductions are discussed.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{exponential}} {{increase in the number of}} mobile phone users. In addition, a significant growth in the demand for high-rate multimedia services over wireless networks, such as video conferencing, multimedia streaming, etc., was noted. Different solutions were proposed to support high quality high data-rate delivery to mobile users, including resource allocation techniques for packet radio-based next generation cellular networks. In this paper, an efficient time slot allocation method- Dynamic Time Slot Partitioning (DTSP) algorithm based on statistical multiplexing is proposed for a two-hop cellular architecture. In DTSP, the available bandwidth resources are increased by partitioning each time slot into several minislots; different number of minislots are allocated to different users. The DTSP algorithm is based on <b>asynchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing, wherein users with variable number of packets in their buffers can transmit data sequentially without any loss in the overall available resources. The key advantage of DTSP is that it can flexibly adapt to different quality of service requirements, especially when combined with adaptive modulation. It has been observed that the system capacity achieved by the DTSP algorithm in the downlink mode using adaptive modulation is up to 41 % higher than when existing solutions are employed. In addition, DTSP results in significantly lower time for data transmission than the state-of-the-art region and time partitioning techniques...|$|E

40|$|The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a transmission, {{multiplexing}} and swithching technique {{which has}} been developed to meet the growing demand for broadband communications in the wide area {{as well as in}} the local area. ATM networks are based on a packet- and connection-oriented information transfer using fixed size packets called cells. Several connections share the network resources according to their actual demand by using the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiplexing principle. This provides a flexible bit rate allocation which is needed to support a wide variety of different communication services with its distinct bit rate and quality of service requirements. This thesis is concerned with two key components of this traffic control framework - the cell loss priority and the connection admission control. The cell loss priority control provides two different bearer services with distinct cell loss probabilities, while the connection admission control function decides whether a new connection request can be accepted or not. The first part of the thesis is devoted to a systematic investigation of the relationship among traffic, system and performance characteristics. This provides a solid basis for a comparative study of different cell loss priority and connection admission control algorithms, which is the aim of the second part of the thesis. (orig.)

Its goal is to efficiently utilize a common communica-tlons channel while maintaining uniform picture quality at the receiver. In this paper, we present queueing models of such schemes, and use them to assess their probabilistic behavior. First, we analyze the coding hit rate of a single video source as a function of time based on experimental data of a video telephone scene. VBrious statistical quantities are derived from bit rate data collected with a conditional replenishment interframe coding scheme. Two correlated Markov process models (one in discrete t h e and one in continuous time) are shown to fit the experimental data and are used to model the input rates of several independent sources into a statistical multiplexer. The continuous-time model is used with a flow-equivalent approximate queueing analysis to obtain the common buffer length distribution. The analysis is validated with computer simulations that use the dwreie-time source model and take into account the discrete nature of the packet qneue. Numerical results are presented for vadable channel utilization and number of multiplexed video sources. Our analyses demonstrate the statistical smoothing effect of packetized video in a single link. The multiplexer performance, in terms of the probability of buffering or delaying beyond a certain Ilmit, is shown to improve dramatically as the number of multiplexed sources incream beyond one.

40|$|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the {{underlying}} transport mechanism for future high-speed communication {{networks in the}} local area {{as well as in}} the wide area. ATM is a packet-oriented transport technique based on short packets of fixed size called cells. ATM networks are connection-oriented by definition. A virtual connection has to be set up before any data can be transferred across the network. During the connection setup phase, a path is selected by the network that all cells of the connection will follow. On each link along this path, a logical channel number is assigned to the connection and carried in the cell header. Cells of many connections can be multiplexed onto the same physical transmission link using the <b>asynchronous</b> <b>time</b> <b>division</b> (ATD) multiplexing scheme. Cells are switched using translation tables associating each incoming logical channel number with an outgoing port and a new logical channel number. Although the tables are controlled by software, it is mandatory to implement the actual cell transport in hardware using dedicated high-speed switching fabrics. A plethora of different architectures for ATM switching networks have been proposed in the literature. One of the objectives of this thesis is to provide a systematic description of ATM switch fabrics by identifiying a common set of key characteristics defining each architecture. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the performance evaluation and comparison of major characteristics affecting switch performance. (orig.)

In most artificial society discrete-event simulation models, synchronous time evolution is used to drive the actions and interactions of the landscape and agents.
