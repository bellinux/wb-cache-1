2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about our reading at meal times…".|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
60|$|I hear him, {{and shake}} hands with him; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk,</b> and walk, and dine, and so on; but I don't believe it. Nothing is real.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] I signalled, [...] "I have no key." [...] With a gesture, {{she drew}} close, stooped, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> there together, muttering in the porch.|$|R
60|$|So I {{looked at}} the newspaper. Then I asked the landlady for a cigarette, not knowing how else to begin. So she came to my table, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Liam Payne has {{reported}} that the idea came from a fan's petition. [...] "A Twitter fan started an online petition for us to launch a fragrance, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> to our management", he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, by {{the special}} mercy of Providence Severall is a rank Radical, and I am a good stiff Unionist, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> Home Rule for two solid hours every evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|His request seemed still {{something}} of a shock to the poor old lady's candour. [...] "Well, I see her very often, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> a great deal. And then--won't Verena tell her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{a dashed}} good idea, which wouldn't have {{occurred}} to anybody but a genius. I've been quite a pal of Adamson's ever since I had the flu. I go to tea with him occasionally, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> medical shop. Have you ever tried talking medical shop during tea? Nothing like it for giving you an appetite.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a cruel mother!" [...] I said, and {{she laughed}} merrily, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> a little longer, and then seeing her about to go, I said, [...] "you must be just seven years old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I swear, beloved! {{and thus}} I seal my oath!" [...] and {{she kissed me}} on the forehead. And I, too, kissed her; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of what <b>we</b> would do when <b>we</b> were wed, <b>and</b> how <b>we</b> should {{overcome}} the Roman.|$|R
5000|$|Kool G Rap on Collaboration Origin:“Necro was {{reaching}} out and then he finally reached out and connected with somebody in my camp and me and Necro had a meeting, <b>we</b> sat down <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> agreed on doing this project." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{often think}} of the great Queen, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of her freely. Once, when I {{said with a sigh}} that I was sorry she could not have waked into a new life in a new world, my wife, putting both her hands in mine and looking into my eyes with that far-away eloquent dreamy look which {{sometimes}} comes into her own, said lovingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like that}} sort of thing. I'm too busy to be worried with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up {{families}} so. Now don't say any more about it. Meg's wedding has turned all our heads, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. I don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject;" [...] and Jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all alike. It's {{your way}} with us. All of you. There isn't {{a man in}} the world deserves to have a woman in the world. We do all we can for you. We do all we can to amuse you, we dress for you <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> for you. All the sweet, warm little women there are! And then you go away from us! There never was a woman yet who pleased and {{satisfied}} a man, who did not lose him. Give you everything and off you must go! Lovers, mothers...." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Stephen came in <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> things over. He and Prissy {{had made}} {{good use of}} their time, short as it had been. Prissy had promised to marry him, and all that {{remained}} was to get the ceremony performed.|$|R
60|$|More {{composure}} came to {{me after}} a while, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> as <b>we</b> used to <b>talk,</b> lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change whatever in Joe. Exactly {{what he had been}} in my eyes then, he was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I did, though," [...] said Lapham. [...] "You wait. We settled our business, <b>and</b> then <b>we</b> {{went into}} the old thing, from the very start. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> it all over. <b>And</b> when <b>we</b> got through we shook hands. Well, I don't know when it's done me so much good {{to shake hands with}} anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|He comes {{every day}} to paint <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> a great deal and he [...] reads me lovely things out of his books. I don't {{understand}} [...] them all, but I try to, and he explains them so nicely and is [...] so patient with my stupidity. And he says any one with my [...] eyes and hair and coloring {{does not need to}} be clever. He [...] says I have the sweetest, merriest laugh in the world. But I [...] will not write down all the compliments he has paid me. I [...] dare say he does not mean them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Old Smoke-'em-out {{is dressed}} clerico-rural, {{and has the}} mingled air of a {{landlord}} and a claim jumper. Which aspect he corroborates by telling us {{that he is the}} host and perpetrator of Woodchuck Inn. I introduces Andy, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about a few volatile topics, such as will go around at meetings of boards of directors and old associates like us three were. Old Smoke-'em-out leads us into a kind of summer house in the yard near the gate and took up the harp of life and smote on all the chords with his mighty right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, he has ridden {{behind me}} each time that I have been away since I engaged him. When I say behind me, he starts behind me, but when {{out of town}} I call him up beside me, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk,</b> or rather try to talk, in Italian--or rather I should say in Piedmontese, for {{he tells me that}} each {{district}} of Italy has its own dialect, and that the natives of one can scarce understand the other. I have bought a book printed here and a dictionary, and of an evening when I have no duties to perform he comes into my room, and translates sentence by sentence as I read it to him. I learn it by heart, and hope that ere long I shall be able to make myself understood in it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{founding}} team met up socially after Studio Liverpool <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{about all}} the things we had achieved over the years, the platform launches, the variety of games, going back to Psygnosis days and through to F1 <b>and</b> Wipeout. <b>We</b> knew we wanted to carry on making great games," [...] Ankers told IGN.|$|R
60|$|I {{sat beside}} her on the window-seat, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of what I was doing, and when it would be done, and of the {{progress}} I had made since my last visit. Agnes was very cheerful; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous to be talked to, on such subjects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our cat {{ran away}} once, {{and he brought}} her back, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off. I mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I'm sure he does," [...] said Jo decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good getting mad at a {{compliment}} like that. The English all do it. They're a crazy breed. When they don't know you they freeze up tighter'n the St. Lawrence. When they do, {{they go out}} like an ice-jam in April. Up till we prisoners left--four days--my Captain Mankeltow told me pretty much all about himself there was; his mother and sisters, and his bad brother that was a trooper in some Colonial corps, and how his father didn't get on with him, and--well, everything, as I've said. They're undomesticated, the British, compared with us. They talk about their own family affairs as if they belonged to someone else. 'Taint as if they hadn't any shame, {{but it sounds like}} it. I guess they talk out loud what we think, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> out loud what they think.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{until the}} Night, merciful alone {{of all things}} to the ugly, draws her veil across its sordid {{features}} will it, as some fond old nurse, sought out in after years, open wide its arms to welcome me. Then the teeming life it now shelters, hushed for a time within its walls, the flickering flare from the [...] "King of Prussia" [...] opposite extinguished, will it talk with me of the past, asking me many questions, reminding me of many things I had forgotten. Then into the silent street come the well-remembered footsteps; in and out the creaking gate pass, not seeing me, the well-remembered faces; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> concerning them; as two cronies, turning the torn leaves of some old album where the faded portraits in forgotten fashions, speak together in low tones of those now dead or scattered, with now a smile and now a sigh, and many an [...] "Ah me!" [...] or [...] "Dear, dear!" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{the same}} crowd in the Raphael Stanze, but rather silenter, for by now we have taught {{ourselves}} enough from our Baedekers at least to read them under our breaths, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> low before the frescos and the canvases. Some of us are even mute {{in the presence of}} the School of Athens, whatever reserves we may utter concerning the Transfiguration. If we are honest, we more or less own what our impressions really are from those other famous works, concerning which our impressions are otherwise altogether and inexpressibly unimportant; it is a question of ethics and not aesthetics, as most of our simple-hearted company suppose it to be; and, if we are dishonest, we pretend to have felt and thought things at first-hand from them which we have learned at second-hand from our reading. I will confess, for my small part, that I had more pleasure in the coloring and feeling of some of the older canvases and in here and there a Titian than in all the Raphaels in the Stanze of his name.|$|E
60|$|Kendricks and I thought alike {{about the}} Pompeian {{house as a}} model of {{something}} that might be done {{in the way of a}} seaside cottage in our own country, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> up a little paper that might be done for Every Other Week, with pretty architectural drawings, giving an account of our imaginary realisation of the notion.|$|R
60|$|This is a digression. I {{was not the}} man {{to touch}} the Commons, and bring down the country. I submissively expressed, by my silence, my {{acquiescence}} in all I had heard from my superior in years <b>and</b> knowledge; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about The Stranger and the Drama, and the pairs of horses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow's gate.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood beside}} him on the river bank, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> the handle of my parasol touched the bottom button of his waistcoat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am serious," [...] Rupert said, almost angrily. [...] "What is one's {{tongue in}} {{comparison}} to one's brother? What do you think, Easton? Do you think the idea is at all feasible? I may say {{that for the last}} two months I have been working almost night and day at the language. I engaged a fellow the day I came out of hospital. He was working for one of those Greek shopkeepers. He is a native of Dongola, but has been down in Egypt and picked up a certain amount of French. He goes about with me in the boat, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> all day and as long as I can keep him awake at night. Of course I don't think for a moment that I could learn enough to pass as a native for {{at least a couple of}} years; but it would be of no use my going up with a party of Arabs if I could not make out what they say and learn what news they pick up, and make arrangements to get Edgar away if we find him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... . In the {{afternoon}} to the Prado. Beautiful day. At {{the moment of}} ringing at the door a strong emotion of an anxious kind. Why? Down {{the length of the}} dining-room in the rotunda part full of afternoon light Doña R., sitting cross-legged on the divan in the attitude of a very old idol or a very young child and surrounded by many cushions, waves her hand from afar pleasantly surprised, exclaiming: “What! Back already!” I give her all the details <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> for two hours across a large brass bowl containing a little water placed between us, lighting cigarettes and dropping them, innumerable, puffed at, yet untasted in the overwhelming interest of the conversation. Found her very quick in taking the points and very intelligent in her suggestions. All formality soon vanished between us and before very long I discovered myself sitting cross-legged, too, while I held forth on the qualities of different Mediterranean sailing craft and on the romantic qualifications of Dominic for the task. I believe I gave her the whole history of the man, mentioning even the existence of Madame Léonore, since the little café would have to be the headquarters of the marine part of the plot.|$|E
60|$|For instance, it {{is almost}} {{specially}} so with {{the one or two}} things in which the British Government, or the British public, really are behaving badly. The first, and worst of them, is the non-extension of the Moratorium, or truce of debtor and creditor, to the very world where there are the poorest debtors and thc cruellest creditors. This is infamous: and should be, if possible, more infamous to those who think the war right than to those who think it wrong. Everyone knows that the people who can least pay their debts {{are the people who are}} always trying to. Among the poor a payment may be as rash as a speculation. Among the rich a bankruptcy may be as safe as a bank. Considering the class from which private soldiers are taken, there is an atrocious meanness in the idea of buying their blood abroad, while we sell their sticks at home. The English language, by the way, is full of delicate paradoxes. We talk of the private soldiers because they are really public soldiers; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> of the public schools because they are really private schools. Anyhow, the wrong is of the sort that ought to be resisted, as much in war as in peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} foolish people, you and I," [...] she laughed. [...] "We came {{together}} so strangely <b>and</b> yet <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> such frivolous nonsense." ...|$|R
2500|$|Janick recalls it as follows: [...] "He rang me up <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> but I {{remember}} saying, 'There {{is no way}} in {{this world}} that I am putting on make up or anything like that, I'm just not into that shit.' But we had a chat and he seemed like a nice enough guy. But I never heard back from him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{have so much}} to tell you, and the {{carriage}} is waiting already. Thank goodness we dine alone to-morrow night. But there is one thing which I must tell you at once. Sir Michael Trogoldy is in town, you know. He took me in to dinner at Amberley House last night, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about you." ...|$|R
