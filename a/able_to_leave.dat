Shu destroys the Eat Yeet in Devour Village, and the party is finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Eventually all the party are able to summon their shadows again.|$|E
5|$|In March 1865, {{the river}} {{began to rise}} and Missouri was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Shreveport area for the first time. She reached Alexandria, Louisiana on 8 April and {{anchored}} where she could defend the town. Captain Carter surrendered the ship to Union forces on 3 June, the last Confederate ironclad to surrender. After her armor was removed, Missouri was sold at public auction on 29 November.|$|E
5|$|Like other amphibians, {{the life}} cycle of a frog {{normally}} starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a tadpole. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.|$|E
50|$|Taylor {{appointed}} Bliss as Private Secretary to the President (he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave</b> {{from the}} Army for this assignment).|$|R
60|$|John {{tried to}} rectify the {{confusion}} in the work-box {{with a sort of}} reverential care; not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> bear <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it in disorder, whether its mistress were ever to open it again or not, yet feeling it an intrusion to meddle with her little feminine hoards of precious trifles.|$|R

5|$|A {{period of}} decline {{began with the}} {{abolition}} of the Zaporozhian Host by Catherine II of Russia. In 1786 the Russian Imperial government closed the monastery and confiscated its valuable treasures. The remaining Zaporozhian Cossacks soon afterwards left Zaporizhia, and moved to the Kuban region. There they founded the Kuban Cossack Host, which still exists to this day. The cossacks were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> with some of the monastery's manuscripts, some of which are now kept in the Krasnodar Krai Archive.|$|E
5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He lay on the ice {{for a few minutes}} before being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{it is as}} I feared," [...] sighed Marian. [...] "I {{wonder how}} it is that I have thought so much about myself; but it would come into my head, what was to become of us, and I was very much afraid of living with the Lyddells; but still there was a little glimmering of hope that you might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> us with the Wortleys." ...|$|R
5|$|Melvin's {{first problem}} {{was that there was}} no {{forensic}} evidence. Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack, which meant that the crime scene had not been secured. Witnesses and those directly involved were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without giving their names. Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected. Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4am, by which time much of the evidence had disappeared. Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council's clean-up operation.|$|E
5|$|The Tunisian desert {{was again}} {{used for the}} Tatooine scenes; Mos Espa was built outside the city of Tozeur. On the night {{following}} {{the third day of}} shooting in Tozeur, an unexpected sandstorm destroyed many of the sets and props. The production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Tunisia on the date originally planned. The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace; it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.|$|E
5|$|The pie {{originates}} {{from the}} fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with {{many parts of}} Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the pie is served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning {{that none of the}} fishing boats had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.|$|E
50|$|Ibrahim Yinal was {{nevertheless}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> safely <b>leave</b> the Byzantine territory, {{laden with}} spoils and captives. The emperor later sent ransoms to Toğrül who refused them, however, and released Liparit {{on condition that}} he would never again fight the Seljuqs.|$|R

50|$|Giles calls Buffy's {{contacts}} in Cleveland but is <b>able</b> only <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{a message for}} the very busy Slayer. He learns that the amulet Cordelia was wearing is that of Anyanka, whose granted wishes can be undone only if her center of power is destroyed.|$|R
5|$|The {{reign of}} King Donnchad I from 1034 {{was marred by}} failed {{military}} adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040. MacBeth ruled for seventeen years, so peacefully that he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> to go on pilgrimage to Rome. However, he was overthrown by Máel Coluim, the son of Donnchad who some months later defeated MacBeth's stepson and successor Lulach to become king Máel Coluim III. In subsequent medieval propaganda Donnchad's reign was portrayed positively, while MacBeth was vilified. William Shakespeare followed this distorted history in describing both men and the Queen consort Gruoch in his play Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{territory in}} the Cotentin Peninsula south as far as Saint-Lô, the U.S. First Army launched Operation Cobra on 25 July and advanced further south to Avranches by 1 August. The British launched Operation Bluecoat on 30 July to secure Vire and the high ground of Mont Pinçon. Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Third Army, activated on 1 August, quickly took most of Brittany and territory {{as far south as}} the Loire, while the First Army maintained pressure eastward toward Le Mans to protect their flank. By 3 August, Patton and the Third Army were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a small force in Brittany and drive eastward towards the main concentration of German forces south of Caen. Over Kluge's objections, on 4 August Hitler ordered a counter-offensive (Operation Lüttich) from Vire towards Avranches.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by {{returning}} her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.|$|E
5000|$|Full-time workers became {{part-time}} workers, but had {{not already}} taken their accrued rights <b>to</b> paid annual <b>leave.</b> The employer contended that as part timers they should only be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave</b> at the rate available as part-time staff. The workers claimed this breached the Part-time Workers Directive and the Fixed-term Workers Directive ...|$|R
50|$|The {{flooding}} stranded 2,100 {{visitors in}} the park. Stranded New Years' vacationers were finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>leaving</b> Yosemite Valley on January 3, {{as the worst}} of the flooding was over, though the drive out of the park still saw many cars partially submerged in water.|$|R

5|$|Before Haruna struck Madagascar, a {{pre-existing}} system produced deadly flooding, {{and when}} the cyclone crossed the country, it added additional rainfall to the region. Flooding was worst in Toliara where a dyke burst, flooding much {{of the town and}} leaving residents without water or power. Many villages in southwestern Madagascar lost access to clean water, prompting various international agencies to deploy teams to decontaminate wells. Haruna destroyed 7,402houses, which left 13,882people homeless. Most of the displaced people were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their shelters by early April. The cyclone damaged rice and maize crops along the coast, although there were extended residual effects when a locust outbreak occurred, affecting half of Madagascar's farmlands by July 2013. Throughout Madagascar, Haruna killed 26people and injured 127 directly, and there were outbreaks of various diseases in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|His {{basketball}} {{performance in}} high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated high school he would be {{thrown out of the}} house. Chris had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had nowhere to go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July, Contador's agent {{announced}} that Contador had {{turned down an}} offer to remain with Astana under a new four-year contract because he had felt uncomfortable being caught between the Kazakhs {{on one side and}} Bruyneel on the other, and he was hoping to leave Astana before his contract expired in 2010. However, on 11 August, Contador's close friend Sergio Paulinho accepted a two-year contract with Team RadioShack, indicating that Contador might not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Astana as he and his agent wished. This was confirmed on 15 August, when a spokesperson for the Kazakh sponsors of Astana said that they intended to sponsor the Astana team on the UCI ProTour through 2013 and that they intended to enforce the last year of Contador's contract with Astana in 2010.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jennings {{was delighted}} with her gratitude, and only {{wondered}} that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take <b>leave</b> of them, as he immediately did, {{with the utmost}} sang-froid, and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} issuing {{withdrawal}} statements {{is referred to}} in Chinese as [...] "Tuìdǎng" [...] (退党), which can be translated as [...] "withdraw from the party" [...] or [...] "quit the party."

5|$|Soon {{after the}} Sharpeville {{massacre}} in 1960, Makeba {{learned that her}} mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Two of Makeba's family members were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The plague in London largely {{affected}} the poor, as the rich were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{the city by}} either retiring to their country estates or residing with kin {{in other parts of}} the country. The subsequent Great Fire of London, however, ruined many city merchants and property owners. As a result of these events, London was largely rebuilt and Parliament enacted the Rebuilding of London Act 1666. Although the street plan of the capital remained relatively unchanged, some improvements were made: streets were widened, pavements were created, open sewers abolished, wooden buildings and overhanging gables forbidden, and the design and construction of buildings controlled. The use of brick or stone was mandatory and many gracious buildings were constructed. Not only was the capital rejuvenated, but it became a healthier environment in which to live. Londoners had a greater sense of community after they had overcome the great adversities of 1665 and 1666.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of magistrates in England and Wales: justices of the peace and {{district}} judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates) who hold office as members of the professional judiciary. According to requirements, around 50% of magistrates are women. Over 41% of magistrates are retired from employment while others may be self-employed or <b>able</b> <b>to</b> arrange <b>leave</b> from their employment.|$|R
50|$|While Almonde and Ashby pursued Pannetier, Russell {{was chasing}} Tourville eastward along the Cotentin coast.

5000|$|The {{historical}} name of {{this city}} was ''''Mohanavati Nagar''''. There is a fable about this name change. There was strong belief among native peoples that this city was [...] "enchanted".

The current name {{of the city is}} Mukhed.|$|R
