After treatment, eggs were distributed and maintained until hatching in four incubators set at 37. 8 ºC and 55 % RH. Each incubator received eggs from all treatments, according to a block design with four treatments of 77 - 79 replicates each. Hatching was checked every two hours from 484 h to 512 h of incubation to evaluate productivity and chick qualities.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{assessment and}} three in vivo trials {{were conducted to}} measure the nutritive value of whole soybeans subjected to various methods of heat treatment. No {{significant differences were found}} for ADG and feed conversion ratio. There was a significant reduced proportion of saturated-to unsaturated fatty acids in the loin eye area of pigs fed whole soybean products, when compared to soybean meal control. Extruded whole soybeans resulted in a lower degree of unsaturation than the other heat treated whole soybeans. Whole soybean products were evaluated for their digestibility in weanling (21 days) piglets. Feces were collected daily during two 5 -day periods. It was found that the ether extractable portion of extruded whole soybeans has a higher digestibility than that of the remaining four soybean treatments.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{individual}} and combined effects of aflatoxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) were evaluated in young broiler chickens (Hubbard X Hubbard). The experimental design was a 2 X 2 factorial with treatments of 0 and 2. 5 jug of aflatoxin/g of feed (ppm) and 0 and 16 Mg of DON/g of feed. The broilers were maintained on these dietary treatments from hatching to 3 weeks of <b>age</b> <b>in</b> electrically <b>heated</b> batteries with feed and water available ad libitum. The aflatoxin treatment significantly (P<. 05) decreased body weight; weight gain; increased the relative {{weight of the}} spleen, liver, and kidney; induced hepatic hyperlipemia; decreased activity of lactic dehydrogenase; and decreased serum levels of protein, albumin, and phosphorus. The toxicity of DON was ex-pressed through reduced growth rate, increased feed conversion; increased relative weight of the gizzard, anemia, decreased activity of lactic dehydrogenase, and decreased serum triglycerides. The interaction between aflatoxin and DON was characterized by reduced growth rates; increased feed conversion, increased relative weight of the proventriculus, gizzard, spleen, liver, and kidney, anemia, hepatic hyperlipemia, decreased activity of alkaline phosphatase, glutamic oxalacetic transaminase, and lactic dehydrogenase, and decreased serum levels of protein, albumin, uric acid, cholesterol, triglycerides, and calcium.

It can undergo different constraints like heat or high voltage which influence its performances as insulator. In this study, {{the effects of}} heating on structural and electrical properties of polyetherimide (Ultem 1000) are studied. Approach: PEI samples were heated at different temperatures below the glass transition temperature (175, 190 and 205 °C). Different complementary techniques were used to investigate structural alterations and dielectric relaxations. These are infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermally Stimulated Depolarisation Current (TSDC) technique and Dielectric Spectroscopy (DS). Results: Physical <b>ageing</b> was revealed <b>in</b> <b>heated</b> samples by DSC analysis. DS and TSDC results have shown that dipolar relaxations are affected by heating. The amount of relaxing dipoles decreases when the material is heated at 190 °C.

40|$|Accelerated <b>ageing</b> <b>in</b> damp <b>heat</b> (DH) {{can reduce}} the {{stability}} of chalcopyrite solar modules. The decrease in lateral conductivity of the transparent Al-doped zinc oxide (ZAO) front contact contributes significantly to this effect. We present {{a study on the}} optical and electrical properties of ZAO without encapsulation on transparent quartz glass substrates with smooth and rough morphology before and after DH. Measured transmission/reflection curves are evaluated numerically to obtain the Drude mobility and carrier concentration. Comparison of optical and electrical data is helpful in evaluating the carrier transport in inhomogeneous ZAO layers, in particular the contributions of grains, grain boundaries and, what we have termed, 'extended grain boundaries'. The latter are perturbations in the ZAO growth caused by the substrate microstructure. After 1000 h of exposure to DH, the lateral electrical conductivity of ZAO on smooth quartz decreases only by a factor of two, whereas it changes up to two orders of magnitude on rough quartz. Carrier concentration and mobility derived from the optical analysis show a systematic but only minor degradation within the grains. We thus conclude, that the substrate morphology is the dominant factor on the extent of ZAO degradation. Due to the significant difference in the decrease of conductivity on rough and smooth substrates, we postulate that the extended grain boundaries are the prevailing source of this degradation...|$|R

40|$|The heat {{resistance}} of Calliphora erythrocephala varies {{during the life}} history. The egg is most sensitive to high temperature and the puparium most resistant. Puparial resistance develops in the larval stage and declines in the young adult. This adult decline is temperature dependent {{and seems to be}} related to changes taking place during maturation. Evidence for the existence of development acclimatization was found to be contradictory, however, physiological acclimatization did occur in the adult. This latter form of acclimatization differs from the typical pattern observed with other species, for the increase <b>in</b> <b>heat</b> resistance with increasing temperature of acclimatization is not proportionate and it declines with adult age. The interaction of these factors makes resistance adaptation in Calliphora erythrocephala a complex phenomena. It is concluded that the primary lesion of <b>heat</b> death <b>in</b> adults is the uncoupling of the sarcosomal enzymes associated with oxidative phosphorylation of ɤ glycerophosphate. The heat sensitivity of this enzyme pathway is correlated with the heat death point of the whole animal and death is probably the result of a breakdown in ATF synthesis, which leads to the interruption of other energy dependent processes. The biochemical lesions during heat death are correlated with dramatic changes in the ultrastructure of sarcosomal cristae, which house the respiratory assemblies. This suggests that the structural and functional integrity of membrane-enzyme complexes are important factors in cellular metabolism. Studies on isolated sarcosomes have shown that the coupling of oxidative phosphorylation is influenced by both age and acclimatized state of the fly. The coupling enzymes are implicated <b>in</b> both the <b>age</b> dependent changes <b>in</b> <b>heat</b> resistance and also capacity adaptation.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{network of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae is highly flexible {{in response to}} rapid changes in the environment. Amino acid metabolism {{plays an important role}} in many cellular processes and this thesis addresses dynamic changes in amino acid metabolism during several physiological changes including: heat shock, one-carbon metabolism and anaerobiosis. 	Glycine and L-serine are interconvertible one-carbon donors, while L-threonine is the major supplier of glycine in cells. Previous work demonstrated that glycine addition led to induction of the one-carbon regulon, and L-serine addition led to the biosynthesis of pyruvate. Interestingly, L-threonine addition resulted in the shuttling of L-threonine to L-serine and subsequent catabolism to pyruvate. Transcriptional data showed that L-threonine-derived glycine did not induce the one-carbon regulon; instead it induced the glycine decarboxylase/serine hydroxymethyltransferase system and catabolic L-serine (L-threonine) deaminase to enable the continuous flow from L-threonine to pyruvate. The addition of L-threonine may have activated the GAAC response as a result of an imbalance in metabolism. This response is mediated by Gcn 4 p, the master regulator of amino acid biosynthesis. 	Gcn 4 p and L-serine also play important roles in anaerobic amino acid metabolism. The lack of L-serine in anaerobic gcn 4 cells induced an extended lag phase as a result of L-serine starvation. The availability of L-serine was crucial for the biosynthesis of serine-rich cell wall mannoproteins that are essential and specific to anaerobic cells. Mutation of GCN 4 led to the inability of cells to biosynthesise L-serine from L-threonine, thus relying on biosynthesis from 3 -phosphoglycerate and/ or the glyoxylate route. 	L-Tryptophan has been previously shown to be involved <b>in</b> <b>ageing</b> and <b>heat</b> shock resistance. The addition of L-tryptophan to cells led to increased synthesis of L-kynurenine and nicotinate, which were found to be metabolites that assist cells <b>in</b> <b>heat</b> tolerance (50 °C). The addition of L-tryptophan induced a gene expression pattern that has some similarity to the response observed <b>in</b> <b>heat</b> shocked cells, thus the addition of L-tryptophan could have possibly activated the transcription of genes required for heat stress.
