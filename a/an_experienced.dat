50|$|The peak-end rule is an {{elaboration}} on the snapshot {{model of}} remembered utility proposed by Barbara Fredrickson and Daniel Kahneman. This model dictates that an event is not {{judged by the}} entirety of <b>an</b> <b>experience,</b> but by prototypical moments (or snapshots) {{as a result of}} the representativeness heuristic. The remembered value of snapshots dominates the actual value of <b>an</b> <b>experience.</b> Fredrickson and Kahneman theorized that these snapshots are actually the average of the most affectively intense moment of <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> and the feeling experienced at the end. The effects of the duration of <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> upon retrospective evaluation are extremely slight. Fredrickson and Kahneman labeled this phenomenon duration neglect. The peak-end rule is applicable only when <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> has definite beginning and end periods.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will {{claim that the}} {{different}} phenomenology of seeing-as experiences of ambiguous figures matches {{a difference in their}} intentional content. Such a content is non-conceptual when the relevant seeing-as <b>experience</b> is just <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> of organizational seeing-as. It is partially conceptual when the relevant seeing-as <b>experience</b> is <b>an</b> overall <b>experience</b> of seeing something as a picture that is identical with Wollheim’s seeing-in experience and is constituted by <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> of organizational seeing-as (its configurational fold) and by <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> of knowingly illusory seeing-as (its recognitional fold). To my mind, Wittgenstein’s reflections on seeing-as have anticipated these claims...|$|R
40|$|One {{diagnosis}} {{of what is}} wrong with the Knowledge Argument rests on the Ability Hypothesis. This couples an ability analysis of knowing what <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> is like together with a denial that phenomenal propositions exist. I argue against both components. I consider three arguments against the existence of phenomenal propositions and find them wanting. Nevertheless I deny that knowing phenomenal propositions is part of knowing what <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> is like. I provide a hybrid account of knowing what <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> is like which is the coherent expression of a single idea: knowing what <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> is like is knowing {{what it would be like}} to have the phenomenal content of the experience as the content of <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> one is currently having. I explain how my conclusions indicate that the focus of discussion should be on the alleged explanatory gap between phenomenal facts and physical facts and not on the Knowledge Argument. The latter is a poor expression of the difficulty Physicalists face...|$|R

5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was <b>an</b> <b>experienced</b> combat veteran against German targets, {{but he was in}} his forties and had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already <b>an</b> <b>experienced</b> B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E

Although laid down a year before her sister , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard, while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan, <b>an</b> <b>experienced</b> private shipbuilder.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} ethnographic research to create new products and the innovations that result from observed events. To {{take full advantage of}} ethnographic research, the designer must be part of the observation team, because the research can never convey all of the information that is available from the observation itself. Many events occur outside the observation framework, which may be of most value to the designer. The only way he or she can access that information is through firsthand observation. Such observation gives the designer a context to verify assumptions as he or she develops new concepts. The author shares five experiences in which observational research led to innovation in products and product concepts: (1) <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> observing the use of treadmills in the home market, (2) <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> observing daycare children playing with a variety of electronic learning aids (ELAs) for Fisher-Price, (3) <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> observing people working out in a club environment for an exercise equipment manufacturer, (4) <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> working with <b>a</b> company developing a garden sprayer, and (5) <b>an</b> <b>experience</b> observing <b>a</b> retail store for a bar-code scanning company...|$|R
