5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals {{but also the}} recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational device of replacing the staves in silent measures with whites space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's manuscripts as early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E

5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E

As a result, northern industry and entrepreneurs began to recruit laborers from the South. This brought about or accelerated the Great Migration in which black (and white) laborers from the South came North in search of better pay and opportunity.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the vlogger does not scratch in sync with the rhythm, tonicity and tonality of the text; the scratching lasts for two and a half tone groups, and does not match the timing of salient and tonic syllables. But the paralanguage remains in sync, stopping <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tonic syllable of tone group 15 (/ days ago //), resuming with a smile <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tonic syllable of tone group 18 (/ Target //) and resuming with gesture <b>precisely</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of tone group 19.

25|$|The red {{freestone}} of the Keuper {{building stone}} is familiar in buildings and bridges throughout North and West Cheshire. It is easily quarried and yields large free standing blocks and though soft {{at the time}} of quarrying, it has quality of hardening on exposure to the weather. The building stone represents a particular lithology of medium grained massive sandstones within the Keuper Sandstone and may not always lie <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same horizon. It seems likely that the rock quarried {{in the northern part of}} the district is the lateral equivalent in part at any rate to the conglomerates of Alderley Edge which die out northwards. There are no working quarries of any importance today, but there are many old quarries around the area.|$|E

Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> time when I felt that I most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E
500|$|Fisher {{would serve}} just {{over four years}} of his sentence. On February 10, 1962, he was {{exchanged}} for the shot-down American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. The exchange {{took place on the}} Glienicke Bridge that linked West Berlin with Potsdam, which became famous during the Cold War as the Bridge of Spies. <b>At</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same time, at Checkpoint Charlie, Frederic Pryor was released by the East German Stasi into the waiting arms of his father. A few days later Fisher, reunited with his wife Elena and daughter Evelyn, flew home. For the sake of its own reputation it suited the KGB to portray [...] "Abel's" [...] nine years of being an undetected agent in the United States as a triumph by a dedicated NKVD member. The myth of the master spy Rudolf Abel replaced the reality of Fisher's illegal residency. Yet the party hierarchy was well aware that Fisher had achieved nothing of real significance. During his eight years as an illegal resident he appears not to have recruited, or even identified, a single potential agent.|$|E
500|$|The novel ends {{abruptly}} {{with the}} sudden {{appearance of a}} bizarre enshrouded figure having skin hued [...] "of the perfect whiteness of the snow." [...] Many readers were left unsatisfied by this ending because, as Poe relative and scholar Harry Lee Poe wrote, [...] "it didn't match the kind of clear ending they expected from a novel." [...] Poe may have purposely left the ending subject to speculation. Some scholars {{have suggested that the}} ending serves as a symbolic conclusion to Pym's spiritual journey and others suggest that Pym has actually died in this scene, as though his tale is somehow being told posthumously. Alternatively, Pym may die in the retelling of the story <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same point he should have died during the actual adventure. Like other characters in works by Poe, Pym seems to submit willingly to this fate, whatever it is. Kenneth Silverman notes that the figure radiates ambivalence and it is not clear if it is a symbol of destruction or of protection.|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} lists, the designation letter ("Des."

It was a temporary designation with no relevance once the ship's mission was over. The number ("No." [...] column) was a number permanently marked on it by the maker and together with the maker's name uniquely identified the instrument. When referring to chronometers, the maker's name is frequently abbreviated; for instance, Earnshaw's chronometer no. 509 is known simply as E509. The [...] "type" [...] of all chronometers listed here is either box or pocket. A boxed chronometer is mounted on gimbals attached to its box.

500|$|Within the {{explosives}} was the [...] thick aluminum pusher, which provided {{a smooth transition}} from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the [...] thick tamper of natural uranium.

To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of boron.

500|$|On 7 February, Normand's unit fought its {{way into}} the city and began to bombard the Turkish {{positions}} with heavy artillery. The following day, he relieved Cornelope's column, which had held its position for two weeks, and broke through to reach General Quérette's headquarters. To Quérette's astonishment, Normand told that he had come with orders from General Dufieux to begin the full evacuation of the French garrison of Marash, followed by the Christian and loyal Muslim population. Quérette was reluctant to carry out such a command but Normand claimed that no more reinforcements or supplies would be sent. With this in mind Quérette agreed to the evacuation. The order to evacuate ironically came <b>at</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same moment that the Turkish Nationalists were seeking a ceasefire: no sooner had General Quérette begun negotiations with the Turkish representative, Dr. Mustafa, when he was told by Normand to prepare to evacuate. By 3:00 in the morning of 11 February, Quérette had destroyed the remaining ammunition dumps and was preparing to slip out under the cover of darkness, in order to prevent the terrified Armenian population from hindering his troops' withdrawal. They were, however, unable to do so and 4,000–5,000 Armenians managed to flee with the French troops in a three-day, [...] long march to İslahiye. Subsequently called the [...] "Marash Affair," [...] many of the Armenian refugees died from exhaustion and from the bitter cold, such that there were only 1,500 of their number when they reached İslahiye on 13 February.|$|E
