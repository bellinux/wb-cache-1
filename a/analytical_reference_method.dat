40|$|According to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073 / 2005 of 15 November 2005 on {{microbiological}} crite-ria for foodstuff, the <b>analytical</b> <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> for {{the detection}} of Salmonella in food is ISO 6579 : 2004. However this long and labor-intensive method is not in line with the short production times of the food industry. In the last years, Real-Time PCR is used more and more by scientists for the relia-ble, fast and specific detection of bacterial pathogens in food. The aim {{of the present study was}} to eval-uate the Salmonella detection capability of a validated Real-Time PCR assay on naturally contaminated pork cuts in comparison with the reference method ISO 6579 : 2004. Three sampling were performed and included 16 pork cut packaging. From each packaging, three aliquots of 10 g each were tested separate-ly by ISO 6579 : 2004 method and by Real-Time PCR. In particular this molecular method was applied on DNA samples extracted from pre-enrichment broth after 1 and 18 hours of incubation. Within the three sampling periods, Real-Time PCR detected Salmonella in 81 %, 100 % e 62, 5 % of pork cut samples respectively, whereas the corresponding percentages of detection of the reference method were 56 %, 81 % e 62, 5 % respectively. In conclusion the Real-Time PCR assay used in the present study might be a reliable tool for a fast detection of Salmonella on pork cuts, especially when large number of samples needs to be tested. The reference method might be applied only on positive samples for isolation purpos-es mandatory in epidemiological investigations...|$|E

The detection of food hazards in foods is performed by several tests that produce results {{dependent on the}} analytical method used: an <b>analytical</b> <b>reference</b> <b>method,</b> defined as standard, is associated with each microbiological criterion laid down in Regulation 2073 / 2005 /EC, but, analytical methods other than the reference ones, in particular more rapid methods, could be used. Combined screening methods performed by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are currently validated as alternative methods according to the ISO 16140 : 2003 and certified by the Association Française de Normalisation. However, the positive results obtained with these alternative methods, the investigated molecular relations that resulted positive have to be confirmed with cultural methods using the same enrichment media in which the molecular screening was performed. Since {{it is necessary to}} assess if these testing schemes provide equivalent guarantees of food safety, the aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the data collected, from 2012 to 2014 by Emilia Romagna Region in the field of Piano Regionale Alimenti (Food Regional Plan) during official controls monitoring food samples of animal and other than animal origin. Records performed by combined methods of molecular screening of Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and thermophilic Campylobacter and cultural confirmation results were gathered together and the results were compared in order to assess the sensitivity of the methods. A total of 10, 604 food samples were considered in this study: the comparison of the data revealed that the RT-PCR method detected Salmonella, L. monocytogenes, and thermophilic Campylobacter in 2. 18, 3. 85 and 3. 73 % of the samples, respectively, whereas by using cultural method these pathogens were isolated in 0. 43, 1. 57 and 1. 57 % of samples, respectively. In spite of the use of the same enrichment broth, the RT-PCR method disclosed a percentage of positive samples that was negative to cultural examination ranging between 20 and 43 %, with a PCR/culture ratio between 2. 37 to 5. 00. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} pose a doubt about the sensitivity of the official cultural methods regarding the isolation of the three investigated foodborne pathogens. Moreover this study may be a useful tool for veterinary authorities to assess appropriate sampling plans to control the risk relating to the consumption of contaminated foods...|$|E

Para compreender em que medida as rela??es e racionalidades conservadoras tem caracterizado o campo do exerc?cio profissional dos assistentes sociais, adotou-se como referencial anal?tico o m?todo contido na filosofia marxiana. A abordagem utilizada nessa pesquisa foi predominantemente a qualitativa sem deixar de privilegiar a quantitativa. A amostra da pesquisa foi do tipo n?o probabil?stica intencional, por acessibilidade, constitu?da por 23 assistentes sociais concursados. Os resultados da pesquisa evidenciaram que os assistentes sociais da SEMASC n?o tem tido condi??es objetivas satisfat?rias para realizar uma interven??o profissional nas institui??es, de modo a se distanciar do conservadorismo que nutre a l?gica da ordem burguesa. Demonstraram ainda que a falta de condi??es de trabalho dos assistentes sociais da SEMASC para execu??o da pol?tica ? observada na desarticula??o da rede socioassistencial e tamb?m das pol?ticas sociais e por essa desarticula??o, os profissionais tendem a reduzir sua a??o ao atendimento pontual, paliativo das demandas dos usu?rios, o que acaba por refor?ar a manuten??o da racionalidade burguesa. Verificou-se tamb?m que a falta de condi??es de trabalho e para execu??o da pol?tica de assist?ncia social em Aracaju tem impactado sobre a forma de contato dos assistentes sociais com os usu?rios, j? que ela tem se reduzido aos atendimentos das demandas di?rias emergenciais ou imediatas dos usu?rios. Constatou-se o esfor?o e comprometimento dos assistentes sociais pesquisados com a forma??o profissional continuada e permanente, e que esses possuem o entendimento sobre a import?ncia e contribui??o da forma??o acad?mica para o exerc?cio profissional, no sentido de oferecer subs?dios atrav?s do acervo te?rico para a reflex?o que possa situar a pr?tica profissional. Concluiu-se que, diante dos resultados do estudo (pesquisa de campo e levantamento bibliogr?fico), os assistentes sociais pesquisados demonstraram clareza dos elementos que colaborariam para uma pr?tica que se pretenda cr?tica e, de fato, o discurso da maioria desses profissionais transparece a tentativa de se distanciar dos aspectos conservadores que marcaram a g?nese da profiss?o. Por?m, verifica-se que o conservadorismo enquanto express?o ideocultural da ordem burguesa permanece se reproduzindo no ?mbito das variadas esferas da vida social no capitalismo (rela??es sociais, classes, Estado, forma de conhecimento, institui??es, organiza??es sociais, pol?ticas sociais) independentemente da consci?ncia que os assistentes sociais tenham sobre os processos que tem determinado sua reprodu??o, ou ainda apesar da sua cr?tica ao conservadorismo e tentativa de ruptura assegurada nos princ?pios e fundamentos do PEPSS.

To understand the extent to which relationships and rationalities conservative has characterized the field of professional practice of social workers, was adopted as the <b>analytical</b> <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> contained in marxist philosophy. The approach used in this research was predominantly qualitative, while quantitative privilege. The survey sample was non -probabilistic intentional, accessibility, consisting of 23 social workers gazetted. The survey results showed that social workers SEMASC has been unable to perform a satisfactory objective professional intervention in institutions, in order to distance himself from the conservatism that nourishes the logic of the bourgeois order. They also showed that the lack of working conditions of social workers SEMASC for policy implementation is seen in the dismantling of the social assistance network as well as social policies and for this disarticulation, professionals tend to reduce their timely action to meet, the demands of palliative users, which ultimately promotes the maintenance of bourgeois rationality. It was also found that the lack of working conditions and implementation of social welfare policy in Aracaju has impacted on how to contact social workers with the users, since it has been reduced to the attendance of the daily demands of emergency or immediate users. It found the effort and commitment of social workers surveyed with continuing vocational training and permanent, and that they have an understanding of the importance and contribution of academic training for professional practice in order to offer subsidies through the theoretical collection for reflection you can situate the practice. It was concluded that, given {{the results of the study}} (field research and literature), social workers surveyed demonstrated clearly the elements that collaborate to a practice that intends to be critical and, indeed, the speech of the majority of these professionals transpires attempt to distance himself from the conservative aspects that marked the genesis of profession. However, it appears that conservatism - as an expression of the bourgeois order ideocultural - remains reproducing within the various spheres of social life in capitalism (social relations, class, state, form of knowledge, institutions, social organizations, social policies) regardless awareness that social workers have about the processes that have determined its reproduction, or in spite of his criticism of conservatism and attempt to break ensured the principles and fundamentals of PEPSS...|$|E

Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate data analysis was employed to make a varietal classification of commercial Turkish wines (Boğazkere, Cabarnet Sauvignon, Çalkarası, Kalecik Karası, Merlot, Öküzgözü, Papazkarası, Shiraz, Emir, Misket, Narince, Sultaniye and Chardonnay) from 2006 and 2007 vintages. Wine samples (n. 79) including red, rose and white wines were scanned in the mid-IR region (4000 - 650 cm- 1) and three spectral regions (965 - 1565 cm- 1, 1700 - 1900 cm- 1 and 2800 - 3040 cm- 1) were used to classify wines on the basis of grape variety. The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the spectral data of the wine samples. Although a clear classification could not be achieved according to varieties, almost complete classification of red and white wines was observed. For the quantification analysis, a total of eleven enological parameters, including total phenol and anthocyanin content, pH, brix, titratable acidity, colour intensity (CI), tint, yellow%, red%, blue% and the proportion of red colour produced by anthocyanins (dA%) were determined with <b>analytical</b> <b>reference</b> <b>methods.</b> Correlation between the results of the <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> and MIR spectral data was tested with partial least square (PLS) regression analysis and prediction models were developed with the use of these correlations.

The aim of this work was to study in poultry the feasibility of the detection of previous animal exposure to pollutants, particularly through feeding. A target organ tissue was analysed to identify VOCs which are generally produced by animal metabolism in response to pollutant exposure and thus constitute a potential metabolomic signature of this exposure. To test this hypothesis, 6 groups of 10 chickens fed a similar feed either non contaminated or contaminated with one of five pollutants commonly found in poultry production chains (PCDD/Fs, PCBs, PBDEs, PAHs and coccidiostats). The liver of each animal was analysed by SPME-GC-MS for VOCs and by HRMS and LC-MS-MS for pollutants. The results show that VOC metabolic signatures could discriminate the non contaminated chickens from the chickens contaminated with PBDEs, PAHs or coccidiostats. The contaminated and not contaminated chickens could not be discriminated as efficiently for PCDD/Fs and PCBs. These results are discussed in view of the actual levels of the pollutants found in the liver by the <b>reference</b> <b>analytical</b> techniques.

The results of the miniaturized system compared well with a reference bench-operated phosphate auto-analyser and showed {{no significant differences in}} the analytical results (student’s t-test at 95 % confidence level). The optical technology used, comprising of tinted PMMA and polished fluidic channels, has allowed an improvement of two orders of magnitude of the limit of detection (52 nM) compared to currently available portable systems based on this method. The system has a wide linear dynamic range 0. 1 – 60 ?M, and a good precision (13. 6 % at 0. 4 ?M, n= 4). The analytical results were corrected for silicate interferences at 0. 7 ?M, and the measurement frequency was configurable with a sampling throughput of up to 20 samples per hour. This portable micro-analytical system has a low reagent requirement (340 ?L per sample) and power consumption (756 J per sample), and has allowed accurate high resolution measurements of soluble reactive phosphorus in seawater...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with article 32 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 882 / 2004, the European Union Reference Laboratories for feed and food are responsible, among others, for “providing {{national reference laboratories}} with details of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods,</b> including <b>reference</b> methods”. In this frame, a “Compendium of <b>Reference</b> <b>Methods</b> for GMO Analysis”, was produced jointly by the EURL-GMFF and the ENGL in 2010, aiming at providing a technical {{state of the art}} of the detection methods applied in GMO analysis that have been validated according to international standards. The methods collected have been selected based on their reported compliance with ISO 5725 international standard and/or the IUPAC protocol. Each method has then been described in a comprehensive summary which provides the essential information related to the validated method. Not all details are given for each method but all necessary references are provided for further information about each method. This Compendium contains 79 DNA-based reference PCR detection methods; in follow-up editions, it is foreseen to extend the scope of this “Compendium of <b>Reference</b> <b>Methods</b> for GMO Analysis” to include also protein-based detection methods and extraction methods. The present document is a revised edition aligning the “Compendium of <b>Reference</b> <b>Methods</b> for GMO Analysis” with the online database released at [URL] biology and genomic...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{reliability}} of {{the determination of the}} most common substrates with the Ektachem 700 was evaluated. Accuracy control was performed in various ways including the comparison of results with <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values. The influence of protein concentration was investigated systematically using sera containing varying amounts of protein obtained by ultracentrifugation. Bilirubin. Deviation from the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values was within limits of the guidelines (Dt. Ärztebl. 85 (1988) B 517 — B 532). The influence of protein concentration was negligible. Cholesterol. The results agreed well with the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values. The method was not influenced by different protein concentrations. Creatinine. The results were in good agreement with <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values, when the method was calibrated with the primary assigned values of the calibrators. At high protein concentrations, the results were higher than those of the comparative method. Glucose. The mean deviation from the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values was 1. 0 %. There was a clear positive bias at high protein concentrations. Protein. The results from the Ektachem deviated from the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> values by — 6. 8 %.

40|$|Our aim was {{to provide}} a {{meta-analysis}} of the literature concerning the validation of thoracic impedance cardiography (TIC) and to explain variations in reported results from differences in the studies. One hundred fifty-four studies (164 Fisher's Z-transformed correlation coefficients) comparing measurements of cardiac output or related parameters from TIC and a <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> were analyzed. Papers were classified according to differences in TIC methodology, <b>reference</b> <b>method,</b> and subject characteristics. Pooling using the random-effects method yielded an overall correlation of r = 0. 82 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 80 - 0. 84). ANOVA revealed a significant influence of the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> and the subject characteristics on the correlation coefficient. In cardiac patients, the correlation was significantly decreased. No influence of the applied TIC methodology was found. CONCLUSION: TIC might be useful for trend analysis of different groups of patients. However, since the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> was of significant influence, differences between TIC and the <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> are incorrectly attributed to TIC alon...|$|R
40|$|Unborated {{water can}} be added to the reactor coolant system, via the {{chemical}} volume and control system (CVCS), to increase core reactivity. This may happen Inadvertently, because of operator error or CVCS malfunction, and cause an unwanted increase in reactivity and a decrease in shutdown margin. The operator must stop this unplanned dilution before the shutdown margin is eliminated. Since the sequences of events that may occur depend on plant conditions {{at the time of the}} unplanned moderator dilution, the review includes conditions at the time of the unplanned dilution, such as refueling, startup, power operation (automatic control and manual modes), hot standby, and cold shutdown. The review of postulated moderator dilution events considers causes, initiating events, the sequence of events, the analytical moel, the values of parameters used in the analytical model, and predicted consequences of the event. The sequence of events described in the applicant's safety analysis report (SAR) is reviewed by both the RSB. The RSB reviewer concentrates on the need for the reactor protection system and the operator action required to secure and maintain the reactor in a safe condition. The RSB review of SRP Section 6. 3 covers the systems for emergency injection of borated cooling water. The analytical methods are reviewed by RSB to ascertain whether the mathematical modeling and computer codes have been previously accepted by the staff. If a <b>referenced</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> has not been previously reviewed, the reviewer initiates a generic evaluation of the new analytical model...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1989 As {{the role}} of the {{polymeric}} materials in industry broadens, it becomes increasingly important to provide rapid quality evaluation of these materials. Existing quality evaluation methods, such as physical testing, FT-IR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, and X-ray scattering, cannot be used for rapid quality evaluation, because they require substantial sample preparation and long analysis times, and are usually destructive. In contrast, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy requires minimal sample preparation and is not destructive. Therefore, NIR spectroscopy can be used for rapid analysis of polymers, if it is periodically calibrated with a <b>reference</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>method.</b> The success of NIR methods depends on the ability of NIR spectroscopy to determine important compositional and structural properties of polymers. Earlier NIR analyses have demonstrated successful determinations of a few properties, but these studies were very limited in scope, and did not utilize newly-developed NIR instrumentation and multivariate calibration techniques. In this work, the ability of NIR spectroscopy to determine several important compositional and structural properties of polymers is demonstrated, with the aid of multivariate calibration methods. Results indicate that NIR spectroscopy can determine composition in styrene-butadiene copolymers, Reaction Injection Molded (RIM) polyurethanes, polyurethane foams, and EPDM terpolymers, microstructure of poly(butadiene) and styrene-butadiene copolymers, crystallinity in poly(ethylene terephthalate) and Ethylene-Propylene-Diene (EPDM) terpolymers, phase separation in RIM polyurethanes, and adsorption of poly(octadecyl methacrylate) to alumina. Other effects, such as π-π interactions and sequencing effects in polymers, can also be detected by NIR spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Summary: A new {{promising}} {{treatment for}} patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis is extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. In Order {{to learn how to}} Interpret the computed tomographic (CT) densities of gallstones measured in vivo, our radiologists asked the clinical chemistry laboratory to analyse cholesterol, bilirubin and calcium in gallstones. No <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for the analysis of gallstones have been described. A literature search for manageable quantitative methods for these analyses was not successful. Among the different X-ray diffraction, infrared and chemical analyses described, we could find no well documented analyses that have been compared with <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> or proposed <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for serum. This finding prompted us to develop chemical methods for cholesterol, bilirubin and total calcium in gallstones starting from (proposed) <b>reference</b> <b>methods</b> for serum and to investigate the accuracy, imprecision and linearity of these methods...|$|R

Because acceptance of a proposed <b>reference</b> <b>method</b> depends so greatly on the method’s capability for transfer to other laboratories by written specifications and instructions, a transferability testing study was designed and conducted with 14 laboratorIes. The study consisted of preliminary testing of readiness of equipment, reagents, and personnel followed by transferability testing with eight runs on 10 serum pools. Laboratories that did not meet readiness specifications had higher CVs in the transferability testing...|$|R
