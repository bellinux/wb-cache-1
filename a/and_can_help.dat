5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it {{is often used to}} reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
5|$|Anthropologists {{are also}} able to see other markers present on the bones. Past {{fractures}} will be evident {{by the presence of}} bone remodeling. The examination of any fractures on the bones can potentially help determine cause of death as well by determining if a fracture occurred ante-mortem (before death), peri-mortem (at the time of death), or post-mortem (after death). Ante-mortem fractures will show signs of healing while peri- and post-mortem fractures will not. Peri-mortem fractures will usually appear clean while post-mortem breaks will appear brittle. Diseases such as bone cancer might be present in bone marrow samples <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> narrow down the list of possible identifications.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1970, {{a series}} of {{expansions}} were added to Ainsworth's original patterns. They include the following: B4 (1970), A/C (1985) D/disorganized (1986), B5 (1988, 1992) A+, C+, & Depressed (1992, 2010). At later ages, additional categories have been described. Each of these patterns reflects {{a different kind of}} attachment relationship of the infant with the mother/caregiver. An infant may have a different pattern of attachment to each parent as well as to alternate caregivers. Pattern of attachment is thus {{not a part of the}} infant, but is characteristic of the protective and comforting quality of a specific relationship. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioral patterns <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> further predict a child's future personality.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|The exact form of crown used in {{the crest}} varied over time. Until the reign of Henry VI it was usually shown as an open circlet adorned with fleurs-de-lys or stylised leaves. On Henry's first seal for foreign affairs the design was altered with the circlet {{decorated}} by alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From the reign of Edward IV the crown bore a single arch, altered to a double arch by Henry VII. The design varied in details until the late 17th century, but since that time has consisted of a jewelled circlet, above which are alternating crosses formy and fleurs-de-lys. From this spring two arches decorated with pearls, and at their intersection an orb surmounted by a cross formy. A cap of crimson velvet is shown within the crown, with the cap's ermine lining appearing {{at the base of}} the crown in lieu of a torse. The shape of the arches of the crown has been represented differently at different times, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to date a depiction of the crest.|$|E

Maps containing station models aid in the drawing of isotherms, which more readily identifies temperature gradients, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> in the location of weather fronts. Two-dimensional streamlines based on wind speeds show areas of convergence and divergence in the wind field, which are helpful in determining the location of features within the wind pattern. A popular type of surface weather map is the surface weather analysis, which plots isobars to depict areas of high pressure and low pressure.|$|E

25|$|Direct {{benefits}} of epigenomic mapping include probable advances in cloning technology. It {{is believed that}} failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many cancers. Global hypomethylation results in decreased genomic stability, while local hypermethylation of tumour suppressor gene promoters often accounts for their loss of function. Specific patterns of methylation are indicative of specific cancer types, have prognostic value, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> to guide {{the best course of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) {{is caused}} by the {{protozoan}} Haplosporidium nelsoni, generally seen as a multinucleated Plasmodium.

MSX is associated with high salinity and water temperatures. MSX was first noted in Delaware Bay in 1957, and is now found all up and down the East Coast of the United States. Evidence suggests it was brought to the US when Crassostrea gigas, a Japanese oyster variety, was introduced to Delaware Bay.|$|E

25|$|Winemaking in the Loire is characterised by {{a general}} {{avoidance}} of barrel ageing and malolactic fermentation. However some winemakers have begun experimenting with both. Chaptalization is permitted here <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> wine makers {{compensate for the}} under ripeness of the grapes in some years. For red wines there has been more emphasis on extending the maceration time of skin contact {{in order to bring}} out more color and tannins into the wine. Temperature control is also an important consideration with the cold autumn weather sometimes requiring that the must be heated in order to complete fermentation fully.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of the {{syndrome}} is clinical {{since there are}} no laboratory tests to confirm it. For diagnosis a person with documented responsiveness to medication has to increase medication intake beyond dosage needed to relieve their parkinsonian symptoms in a pathological addiction-like pattern. A current mood disorder (depression, anxiety, hypomanic state or euphoria), behavioral disorder (excessive gambling, shopping or sexual tendency, aggression, or social isolation) or an altered perception about the effect of medication also have to be present. A questionnaire on the typical symptoms of DDS has also been developed <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> in the diagnosis process.|$|E

The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take {{attention away from the}} main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out. For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases it is better to include them at {{the beginning and the end}} of the movement, rather than during.|$|E
