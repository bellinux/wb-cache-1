50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the SELDI process is the chromatographic separation step. While liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) {{is based on the}} elution of analytes in the separated sample, separation in SELDI is based on retention. Any sample components that interfere with <b>analytical</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as salts, detergents, and buffers, are washed away before analysis with mass spectrometry. Only the analytes that are bound to the surface are analyzed, reducing the overall complexity of the sample. As a result, there is an increased probability of detecting analytes that are present in lower concentrations. Because of the initial separation step, protein profiles can be obtained from samples of as few as 25-50 cells.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantages}} {{of the use of}} multivariate calibration techniques is that fast, cheap, or non-destructive <b>analytical</b> <b>measurements</b> (such as optical spectroscopy) can be used to estimate sample properties which would otherwise require time-consuming, expensive or destructive testing (such as LC-MS). Equally important is that multivariate calibration allows for accurate quantitative analysis in the presence of heavy interference by other analytes. The selectivity of the analytical method is provided as much by the mathematical calibration, as the analytical measurement modalities. For example, near-infrared spectra, which are extremely broad and non-selective compared to other analytical techniques (such as infrared or Raman spectra), can often be used successfully in conjunction with carefully developed multivariate calibration methods to predict concentrations of analytes in very complex matrices.|$|E

5000|$|In 1960, Spaulding {{explored}} his doctoral ponderings of the [...] "dimensions of archaeology" [...] in a critical— yet relatively forgotten— {{paper in}} which he defined a dimension as [...] "an aspect or property {{of the subject matter}} which requires its own special measuring device." [...] The basic <b>analytical</b> <b>measurements</b> within archaeology consisted of space, time, and form (and their interrelations), an essential concept still recognized in archaeological analysis today. Archaeologists study artifacts in the context of these three dimensions, and all archaeological inferences are affixed to any of these measurements. The relation of form and time represents a [...] approach while the relation of form and space represents a synchronic approach; the alliance of all three constitutes a comprehensive archaeological unit and the foundation of context. Though Spaulding’s discussion focused largely on form and its conceivable statistical measurements, his understanding of the reality of all three dimensions can be considered a moment of clarity in the theory of archaeology.|$|E
50|$|There {{are various}} {{limitations}} in particular for the classical polarography experiment for quantitative <b>analytical</b> <b>measurements.</b> Because the current is continuously measured during {{the growth of}} the Hg drop, there is a substantial contribution from capacitive current. As the Hg flows from the capillary end, there is initially a large increase in the surface area. As a consequence, the initial current is dominated by capacitive effects as charging of the rapidly increasing interface occurs. Toward the end of the drop life, there is little change in the surface area which diminishes the contribution of capacitance changes to the total current. At the same time, any redox process which occurs will result in faradaic current that decays approximately as the square root of time (due to the increasing dimensions of the Nernst diffusion layer). The exponential decay of the capacitive current is much more rapid than the decay of the faradaic current; hence, the faradaic current is proportionally larger {{at the end of the}} drop life. Unfortunately, this process is complicated by the continuously changing potential that is applied to the working electrode (the Hg drop) throughout the experiment. Because the potential is changing during the drop lifetime (assuming typical experimental parameters of a 2 mV/s scan rate and a 4 s drop time, the potential can change by 8 mV from the beginning to the end of the drop), the charging of the interface (capacitive current) has a continuous contribution to the total current, even at the end of the drop when the surface area is not rapidly changing. As such, the typical signal to noise of a polarographic experiment allows detection limits of only approximately 10−5 or 10−6 M.|$|E

Besides,for a consistent interpretation of an analytical method result it is necessary to evaluate the confidence that can be placed in it.

To compare two approaches to estimate the <b>analytical</b> <b>measurement</b> uncertainty in the HPLC analysis of vitamins A (all-trans-retinol and 13 -cis-retinol) and E (-tocopherol) in infant milk powder.
