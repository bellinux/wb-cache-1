Soil hydraulic properties, meteorological data, seeding and harvest dates, crop water management and other experimental data were used as SWAP input. As corresponding to the windy and dry conditions found in many Mediterranean landplanes, PT ET 0 values were significantly lower than PM ET 0 calculations. Furthermore, simulated <b>actual</b> <b>evapotranspirations</b> considering the PT approach (PT-ETc) were lower than {{those found in the}} simulations that consider the PM approach (PM-ETc). Correspondingly, simulated drainage flux and soil water contents were higher when the PT ET 0 approach was used.

The comparisons among the evaluated irrigation options, made with the experimental water-use data, lead almost to the same conclusions than those achieved from the simulated maize water-use.

A constant K1 is used to find the outflows {{as a function of the}} storage in S1.To consider the percolation rate a constant Kd is used as along as the storage is S1.The outflow from the second reservoir is considered to be the groundwater flow (Q3) function of a constant K2 and the storage in S2.The total flow generated from a certain rain event is the sum of the 3 flows.The result of the model are later compared to the actual measured flow values and Nasch parameter is used to calibrate the model by changing the different parameters. The model has in total 9 parameters : TT,Cmelt,FC,C,PWP,L,K1,K2,Kd For a good calibration of the model it is better to use Monte-Carlo simulation or the GLUE-Method to properly define the parameters and the uncertainty in the model.The model is fairly reliable but as usual the need of good input data is essential for good results.HBV has been used for discharge modelling in many countries worldwide, including Brazil, China, Iran, Mozambique, Sweden and Zimbabwe.
