25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and ebonite, primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Telescopic sights for {{tanks were}} adopted before World War II, and these sights usually had {{a means of}} aiming off for target {{movement}} and graticules marked for different ranges. Tank sights were of two general types. Either the sight was in fixed alignment with the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> with ranges marked in the sight, and the gunner laid the range mark on the target. Or during laying the gunner physically set the range to offset the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> from the axis of the sight by the correct amount and laid using the centre mark in the sight.|$|E

50|$|Nearly all {{small bore}} firearms, with the {{exception}} of shotguns, have rifled barrels. The rifling imparts a spin on the bullet, which keeps it from tumbling in flight. The rifling is usually in the form of sharp edged grooves cut as helices along the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> anywhere from 2 to 16 in number. The areas between the grooves are known as lands.|$|E
50|$|The sights are {{of similar}} design and sight picture {{to those of}} the AR-15 - a 2-position flip {{aperture}} rear sight and post foresight - but the rear sight is made of stampings. A notable change is the use of a more conventional lower sight line closer to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> in contrast to the elevated sights of the AR-15. A dovetail is spot welded to the receiver in front of the rear sight for a proprietary ArmaLite quick-detachable scope mount.|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis has}} been completed for a proposed induction logging tool designed to yield data which are used to generate three dimensional images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region surrounding a well <b>bore.</b> <b>The</b> proposed tool consists of three mutually orthogonal magnetic dipole sources and multiple 3 component magnetic field receivers offset at different distances from the source. The initial study employs sensitivity functions which are derived by applying the Born Approximation to the integral equation that governs the magnetic fields generated by a magnetic dipole source located within an inhomogeneous medium. The analysis {{has shown that the}} standard coaxial configuration, where <b>the</b> magnetic moments <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> source and the receiver are aligned with <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well <b>bore,</b> offers <b>the</b> greatest depth <b>of</b> sensitivity away from the borehole compared to any other source-receiver combination. In addition this configuration offers the best signal-to-noise characteristics. Due to the cylindrically symmetric nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tool sensitivity about the borehole, the data generated by this configuration can only be interpreted in terms of a two-dimensional cylindrical model. For a fill 3 D interpretation the two radial components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic field that are orthogonal to each other must be measured. Coil configurations where both the source and receiver are perpendicular to the tool axis can also be employed to increase resolution and provide some directional information, but they offer no true 3 D information...|$|R
50|$|A problem {{affecting}} gun laying, was the tapered external barrel shape. This affected elevation {{when the}} gun was aimed by sighting {{along the top of}} the barrel. In the early 17th century, 'dispart sights' compensated for this. This was a piece of metal placed on the muzzle to make the line of sight parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> Another technique involved measuring the depth of the barrel through the touchhole and at the muzzle, the difference being the wedge size needed to compensate for the tapered barrel.|$|E
5000|$|Elevations were {{measured}} by a clinometer, a device using a spirit level to measure a vertical angle from the horizontal plane. These could be separate instruments placed on a surface parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> or physically integrated into some form of sight mount. Some guns had clinometers graduated in distances instead of angles. Clinometers had several other names including [...] "gunner's level", [...] "range scale", [...] "elevation drum" [...] and [...] "gunner’s quadrant" [...] and several different configurations. Those graduated in ranges were specific to a type of gun.|$|E
50|$|Tangent sights were {{introduced}} in the 19th century. These provided the rear sight used with an 'acorn' or similar foresight at the muzzle. The tangent sight was mounted in a bracket beside or behind the breech, the eyepiece (a hole or notch) was atop a vertical bar that moved {{up and down in}} the bracket. The bar was marked in yards or degrees. This direct-fire sight was aimed at the target by moving the trail horizontally and elevating or depressing the barrel. By the late 19th century the simple open tangent sights were being replaced by optical telescopes on mounts with an elevation scale and screw aligned to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{electric}} motor is described {{with a low}} speed shaft that rotates at a speed much slower than <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> a high speed shaft. It is comprised of a stator having a cylindrical bore with a longitudinal axis and a rotor that carries the low speed shaft which rotates in <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> eccentrically about <b>the</b> axis. There is contact and no magnetic gap between a relatively small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor periphery and <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> A magnetic field, rotating at <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high speed shaft, is applied to <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> <b>The</b> field has longitudinally extending magnetic field components of opposite polarity so that around approximately 180 deg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> <b>the</b> field extends in one direction, while around the other 180 deg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> <b>the</b> field extends in the opposite direction. The rotor includes permanent magnet pole faces at opposite ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike a {{conventional}} engine where <b>the</b> centerline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder <b>bore</b> is in perfect vertical alignment with <b>the</b> rotating <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crankshaft, the Kappa’s centerline is offset {{by a small}} distance. This offset minimizes the lateral force created by the rotating piston & rod assembly (known, and audible, as [...] "piston slap" [...] at its extreme). The net effect is an improvement in fuel consumption {{and a reduction in}} noise, vibration and harshness - it should also help with engine longevity since reduced lateral force will equal reduced bore wear.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{calibrating}} sights, {{there was}} no significant difference in field artillery laying arrangements for most of the 20th century. However, in the 1990s new or modified guns started adopting digital sights, following their successful use in the multi-launch rocket system developed in the 1970s. In these the azimuth and elevation were entered manually or automatically into a layers computer, then guided the layer's use of horizontal and elevation controls until the barrel was in the required horizontal and vertical alignment. This computed a correction for the cross level of the gun and used feedback from electro-mechanical devices, such as gyroscopes and electronic clinometers, aligned to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> These devices were subsequently replaced by ring laser gyros.|$|E
5000|$|Grenfell was {{afterwards}} {{for many}} years associated with the experimental work of Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. He {{was the first to}} direct the Admiralty's attention to the night-sighting of guns and about 1891, on the introduction of the incandescent electric lamp, he invented his 'self-illuminating night sights for naval ordnance.' The invention was for fifteen years attached to all heavy guns in the British navy, and was adopted by some foreign navies. Grenfell {{was also one of the}} first to suggest the use of sight-scales marked in large plain figures for naval guns, and advocated, though without success, the adoption of a telescopic light for day use. He also worked out the arrangement subsequently adopted for quick-firing field artillery, by which the changes of angle between the line of sight and the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> which are required when firing at a moving target can be effected without altering the fine of sight.In April 1877, Grenfell read before the Institution of Naval Architects an able paper advocating the trial of Hermann Gruson's chilled cast-iron armour in England, and in 1887 he published 'Grüson's Chilled Cast-iron Armour' (translated from the German of Julius von Schutz).|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} a {{projectile}} to impact any distant target, the barrel must be inclined to a positive elevation angle relative to the target. This {{is due to the}} fact that the projectile will begin to respond to the effects of gravity the instant it is free from the mechanical constraints of the bore. The imaginary line down the center <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> and out to infinity is called the line of departure and is the line on which the projectile leaves the barrel. Due to the effects of gravity a projectile can never impact a target higher than the line of departure. When a positively inclined projectile travels downrange, it arcs below the line of departure as it is being deflected off its initial path by gravity. Projectile/Bullet drop is defined as the vertical distance of the projectile below the line of departure from the bore. Even when the line of departure is tilted upward or downward, projectile drop is still defined as the distance between the bullet and the line of departure at any point along the trajectory. Projectile drop does not describe the actual trajectory of the projectile.Knowledge of projectile drop however is useful when conducting a direct comparison of two different projectiles regarding the shape of their trajectories, comparing the effects of variables such as velocity and drag behavior.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{distance}} <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{crank throws}} from <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crankshaft determines the piston stroke measurement, and thus engine displacement. A common {{way to increase}} <b>the</b> low-speed torque <b>of</b> an engine {{is to increase the}} stroke, sometimes known as [...] "shaft-stroking." [...] This also increases the reciprocating vibration, however, limiting the high speed capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as [...] "over square" [...] or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder <b>bore.</b> As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.|$|R

5000|$|The FG 42 was a select-fire {{air-cooled}} {{weapon and}} one of the first to incorporate the [...] "straight-line" [...] recoil configuration. This layout, combined with the side magazine, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bore,</b> a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The operating system was derived from that used in the successful Lewis light machine gun with a gas piston-actuated turning-bolt locking mechanism. This system used pressurized exhaust gases from the bore and channeled them through a port drilled in the barrel into a gas cylinder located under the barrel. The rapid build-up of propellant gases imparted rearward pressure on a long-stroke piston, driving it backwards, while an extension of the bolt carrier interacted with a helical camming slot machined into the bolt carrier, converting this linear movement into an angular velocity and forcing the bolt into a rotary motion, clearing the locking juts and unlocking it near the end of the bolt carrier's travel. The weapon was locked into battery by two lugs on the bolt head which recessed into appropriate cavities machined into the receiver walls. Owing to its main intended use by paratroopers, the rear sight (which necessarily was rather high due to the straight stock design) was a flip-up construction.|$|E
