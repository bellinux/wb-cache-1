40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Much work is {{presently}} being done concerning small scale heterogeneities in the earth's crust. These heterogeneities range from pores in sedimentary rocks up to {{fluctuations in the}} density and seismic constants of the earth's crust with scale lengths of kilometers. The ability to study and quantify these heterogeneities using seismic methods {{would be a major}} advance in the earth sciences. Physical modeling {{has been shown to be}} a useful technique for investigating various aspects of wave propagation. In this thesis, two physical modeling experiments (one three-dimensional and one two-dimensional) are used to investigate the scattering of seismic waves from small scale heterogeneities and the changes in seismic velocity and <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> resulting from this scattering. The effects of both isotropic and anisotropic scattering on velocity and <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> are calculated. These experimental results are compared to theoretical results. The theory used for isotropic scattering for the three-dimensional experiment is a modified version of Wu's single scattering theory, where instead of calculating the scattering for a single scatterer using the Born approximation, the exact results for scattering from a cylindrical shape are used. While the results for compressional waves and both components of shear waves compare reasonably well for small scatterer volume fractions, at larger scatterer volume fractions, where the need for multiple scattering is more likely, the results for all waves do not compare as well. Many theories used to test anisotropic scattering predict changes in velocity rather than changes in <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation.</b> The velocity changes are used primarily in this work due to geometrical focusing by a seismic lens that biases the amplitudes (and hence the estimates of <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation)</b> at low frequencies where most theories predict <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation.</b> Velocities are calculated from the data using travel times and low frequency phase shifts for the compressional waves and for one component of the shear waves measured in this two-dimensional experiment. Theories that are used to predict compressional and shear wave velocities for both isotropic and anisotropic scatterers are based on a fractional volume method (isotropic), two crack methods (isotropic and anisotropic), and a finely layered method (anisotropic). The isotropic experimental results have much larger, non-linear changes in the velocities than do the isotropic theoretical results. The anisotropic experimental results have similar shapes to both theoretical anisotropic methods for compressional waves and to the theoretical anisotropic crack method for shear waves. Attenuation is computed using log spectral ratios and compares as well with the theoretical results as can be expected within the limits set. A method using anisotropic <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> to help quantify the scatterers is developed for use with field data...|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{sequences}} of flood basalts dominate the northwest European Atlantic margin. The basalt flows absorb and scatter the higher frequencies present in any source wavelet through intrinsic and <b>apparent</b> seismic <b>attenuation.</b> Successful sub-basalt imaging therefore tends {{to focus on}} the generation of low frequencies in acquisition and retention in processing. Conversely, the Rosebank discovery in the Faroe-Shetland Basin of oil bearing sequences interbedded within the Basalt illustrates that high frequencies need to be recovered in order to delineate subtle stratigraphic plays. For this we require broad bandwidth, a robust approach to signal to noise improvement and accurate knowledge of the seismic quality factor (Q) to compensate for locally strong attenuation effects. We show that the required bandwidth can be obtained from conventionally acquired seismic data through the use of low and high frequency boosting operators and application of a horizon consistent Q field. The latter is derived using the pre-stack Q-inversion (PSQI) method to determine effective Q in defined intervals from the data itself. Through a combination of both techniques a substantial uplift in resolution is demonstrated for the highly prospective intra-basalt units with useable frequencies up to 50 Hz. ...|$|R

These measurements include <b>apparent</b> (diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficient, reflectance) and inherent (absorption and beam attenuation coefficients) optical properties of the water column at several wavelengths. The presence of mucilage layers (which was confirmed by divers) was associated with unique, very sharp subsurface maxima in the vertical distribution of both apparent and inherent optical properties. These layers were characterized by very high values of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of upwelling radiance and the beam attenuation coefficient, as well as the ratio of the scattering-to-absorption coefficients at all wavelengths. The mucilage data were compared to nonmucilage observations and two situations came out regarding surface reflectance ratios: (a) When the mucilage was in (vertically narrow) subsurface layers, mucilage events could not be distinguished from nonmucilage situations; and (b) When the mucilage was more homogeneously distributed throughout the water column and, in particular, approaching the surface, there was a detectable difference with respect to nonmucilage water. However, the data set is small, and the detection capability is based on a small difference, so the variance in nonmucilage water properties may still mask the properties of the mucilage-contaminated water...|$|R

The data set collected includes spectral measurements of the in-water <b>apparent</b> (diffuse <b>attenuation</b> coefficient, reflectance, Q-factor, etc.) and inherent (absorption and scattering coefficients) optical properties, as well as the concentrations of the main optical components (pigment and suspended matter concentrations).

40|$|A field {{investigation}} of a TCE plume in a surficial sand aquifer shows that groundwater–surface water interactions strongly influence <b>apparent</b> plume <b>attenuation.</b> At the site, a former industrial facility in Connecticut, depth-discrete monitoring along three cross-sections (transects) perpendicular to groundwater flow shows a persistent VOC plume extending 700 m from the DNAPL source zone to a mid-size river. Maximum TCE concentrations along a transect 280 m from the source were in the 1000 s of μg/L with minimal degradation products. Beyond this, the land surface drops abruptly to a lower terrace where a shallow pond and small streams occur. Two transects along the lower terrace, one midway between the facility and river just downgradient of the pond and one {{along the edge of}} the river, give the appearance that the plume has strongly attenuated. At the river, maximum TCE concentrations in the 10 s of μg/L and similar levels of its degradation product cis-DCE show direct plume discharge from groundwater to the river is negligible. Although degradation plays a role in the strong plume attenuation, the major attenuation factor is partial groundwater plume discharge to surface water (i. e. the pond and small streams), where some mass loss occurs via water–air exchange. Groundwater and stream mass discharge estimates show that more than half of the plume mass discharge crossing the first transect, before surface water interactions occur, reaches the river directly via streamflow, although river concentrations were below detection due to dilution. This study shows that groundwater and surface water concentration measurements together provide greater confidence in identifying and quantifying natural attenuation processes at this site, rather than groundwater measurements alone...|$|R
40|$|Interacting {{galaxies are}} known to have higher global rates of star {{formation}} on average than normal galaxies, relative to their stellar masses. Using UV and IR photometry combined with new and published H-alpha images, we have compared the star formation rates of ~ 700 star forming complexes in 46 nearby interacting galaxy pairs with those of regions in 39 normal spiral galaxies. The interacting galaxies have proportionally more regions with high star formation rates than the spirals. The most extreme regions in the interacting systems lie at the intersections of spiral/tidal structures, where gas is expected to pile up and trigger star formation. Published Hubble Telescope images show unusually large and luminous star clusters in the highest luminosity regions. The star formation rates of the clumps correlate with measures of the dust attenuation, consistent with the idea that regions with more interstellar gas have more star formation. For the clumps with the highest star formation rates, the <b>apparent</b> dust <b>attenuation</b> is consistent with the Calzetti starburst dust attenuation law. This suggests that the high luminosity regions are dominated by a central group of young stars surrounded by a shell of clumpy interstellar gas. In contrast, the lower luminosity clumps are bright in the UV relative to H-alpha, suggesting either a high differential attenuation between the ionized gas and the stars, or a post-starburst population bright in the UV but faded in H-alpha. The fraction of the global light of the galaxies in the clumps is higher on average for the interacting galaxies than for the spirals. Thus the star forming regions in interacting galaxies are more luminous, dustier, or younger on average. Comment: Astronomical Journal, in pres...|$|R

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of predictive deconvolution one assumes that the seismic trace results from the convolution of a reflectivity series with a wavelet. A fundamental component of the seismic wavelet model is the intrinsic absorption of the earth that causes loss of high frequencies to anelastic processes during propagation.

40|$|Using {{some new}} {{processing}} of the multichannel sonic (MCS) log data from Site 418 A, the resulting P, S, and Stoneley wave velocity estimates and <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> were {{integrated with the}} natural gamma, spectral gamma, resistivity, neutron, density, and caliper logs and core lithology information for interpretation of lithologic cycles and possible paleo fluid flow intervals. These data indicate the presence of multiple breccia or rubble zones in the lower portions of the borehole. These zones are interpreted as the last stages of eruptive cycles as described by Hyndman and Salisbury (1984). The results of permeability (packer) tests and temperature gradient measurements at Sites 395 A and 504 B indicate that fluid flow in the crust at those sites is localized to brecciated zones which occur below massive flow basalts. By analogy, the breccia zones interpreted at Site 418 A may have acted as fluid flow channels at an earlier time. Six major paleo fluid flow zones are interpreted at Site 418 A. These breccia zones have low velocities (P, S, and Stoneley), increased <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation,</b> {{and an increase in}} gamma activity. These intervals are interpreted as permeable pathways which may have been altered by the second stage of oxidizing alteration as described by Holmes (1988). Breccia units occur just below massive basalt flow units. The massive basalt flow units are also easily identified in the MCS data. The resistivity log data suggest that each major eruptive cycle trend is made up of several smaller sub-cycles. The MCS data provides much insight into the variations in lithology in ODP boreholes.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the physical and}} orbital properties of C/ 2011 W 3. After surviving perihelion, the comet underwent major changes (permanent loss of nuclear condensation, formation of spine tail). The process of disintegration culminated with an outburst on December 17. 6 (T+ 1. 6 d) and this delayed response is inconsistent with the rubble pile model. Probable cause was thermal stress from the heat pulse into the nucleus after perihelion, which could also produce fragmentation of sungrazers far from the Sun. The spine tail was a synchronic feature, made up of dust released at < 30 m/s. Since the nucleus would have been located on the synchrone, we computed the astrometric positions of the missing nucleus as the coordinates of the points of intersection of the spine tail's axis with lines of forced orbital-period variation, derived from orbital solutions based on preperihelion astrometry from the ground. The resulting osculating orbital period was 698 +/- 2 years, which proves that C/ 2011 W 3 is the first major member of the predicted new, 21 st-century cluster of bright Kreutz-system sungrazers. The spine tail's tip contained dust 1 - 2 mm in diameter. The bizarre appearance of the dust tail in images taken hours after perihelion with coronagraphs on SOHO and STEREO is readily understood. The disconnection of the comet's head from the preperihelion tail and the <b>apparent</b> activity <b>attenuation</b> near perihelion are both caused by sublimation of all dust at heliocentric distances smaller than ~ 1. 8 solar radii.

Mean patient ages were compared among three groups of pineoblastoma, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation, (PPTID) and pineocytoma and germinoma. [Results]None of the quantitative values of CT attenuation, ADC, and SUV showed significant differences between PPTs and germinomas (p[*]>[*]. 05).

40|$|Attenuation in wave {{propagation}} in soils is {{the decay of}} the wave amplitude. Total attenuation arises from geometric spreading, <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation,</b> and material losses (intrinsic attenuation). Intrinsic attenuation is typically quantified {{in terms of the}} damping ratio, D. In laboratory tests, the damping ratio measurement is in general implemented under quasi-static and resonant conditions. Under both conditions, only material losses are reflected in the measured total attenuation. It should be noted that damping ratios measured by different techniques taken under various frequencies may not be comparable if the damping ratio is viscous in nature. For in-situ testing, corrections for geometric spreading and <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> are required to obtain the material damping ratio. The spectral ratio method is an effective way to make such corrections. Preliminary studies conducted in a K-o-container in the laboratory show that the measured damping ratio by the spectral ratio method (D-min similar to 4 %) is much higher than the measured ratio by the resonant column test (D-min similar to 0. 23 %), although the coupling effects including the transducer response are considered. This discrepancy may be due to interference of the sensor with the propagating wave, multiple reflections from the boundary, near field effects, phase delay and signal distortion from the peripheral electronic devices, and other unknown factors...|$|E

The assumptions include the geometrical spreading rate and the shape of the source spectrum. The inversion parameters are source moment (for each event) a constant relating corner frequency and moment for the entire data set, and two parameters describing a power law frequency dependence of the <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> (Q) in the region. The spectral division method is extended to multi-station recordings. By dividing the spectral quotient of two stations, the source spectrum is cancelled and the final result only depends on the <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> averaged over the different wavepaths. In an attempt to split the <b>apparent</b> <b>attenuation</b> into scattering and intrinsic attenuation, the theory of energy transport as developed by Wu (1985) and Wu and Aki (1988) was applied to the Q(Lg) from regional earthquake recordings. According to this theoretical assumption, the intrinsic attenuation is dominating the amplitude decay of Lg-waves in my data set; i. e. Q-values for scattering are an order of magnitude larger than the respective values for intrinsic attenuation. Hence the above stated apparent Q-values are grossly equivalent to Q-values for intrinsic attenuation.

40|$|In {{writing the}} {{integral}} equations for the median mass diameter and particle concentration, or comparable {{parameters of the}} raindrop size distribution, it is <b>apparent</b> that when <b>attenuation</b> effects are included, the forms of the equations for polarimetric and dual wavelength radars are identical. In both sets of equations, differences in the backscattering and extinction cross sections appear: in the polarimetric equations, the differences are taken with respect polarization at a fixed frequency while for the dual wavelength equations, the differences are taken with respect to wavelength at a fixed polarization. Because the forms of the equations are the same, {{the ways in which}} they can be solved are similar as well. To avoid instabilities in the forward recursion procedure, the equations can be expressed in the form of a final-value. Solving the equations in this way traditionally has required estimates of the path attenuations to the final gate: either the attenuations at horizontal and vertical polarizations at the same frequency or attenuations at two frequencies with the same polarization. This has been done for dual-frequency (air/spaceborne case) and polarimetric radars by the respective use of the surface reference technique and the differential phase shift. An alternative to solving the constrained version of the equations is an iterative procedure recently proposed in which independent estimates of path attenuation are not required. Although the procedure has limitations, it appears to be quite useful. Simulations of the retrievals help clarify the relationship between the constrained and unconstrained approaches and their application to the polarimetric and dual-wavelength equations...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that phase {{cancellation}} at the receiving transducer can result in the overestimation of the frequency dependent ultrasonic attenuation of bone, a quantity that {{has been shown to}} correlate with bone mineral density and ultimately with osteoporotic fracture risk. Evidence supporting this interpretation is provided by phase insensitive processing of the data, which appear to reduce the <b>apparent</b> overestimates of <b>attenuation.</b> The present study was designed to clarify the components underlying phase aberration artifacts in such through-transmission measurements by conducting systematic studies of the simplest possible test objects capable of introducing phase aberration. Experimental results are presented for a Lexan phantom over the frequency range 300 – 700 kHz and a Plexiglas phantom over the 3 – 7 MHz range. Both phantoms were flat and parallel plates featuring a step discontinuity milled into one of their initially flat sides. The through-transmitted signals were received by a 0. 6 mm diameter membrane hydrophone that was raster scanned over a grid coaxial with the transmitting transducer. Signals received by the pseudoarray were processed offline to emulate phase sensitive and phase insensitive receivers with different aperture diameters. The data processed phase sensitively were focused to demonstrate the results of planar, geometrical, and correlation-based aberration correction methods. Results are presented illustrating the relative roles of interference in the ultrasonic field and phase cancellation at the receiving transducer in producing phase aberration artifacts. It was found that artifacts due to phase cancellation or interference can only be minimized with phase insensitive summation techniques by choosing an appropriately large receiving aperture. Data also suggest the potentially confounding role of time-and frequency-domain artifacts on ultrasonic measurements and illustrate the advantages of two-dimensional receiving arrays in determining the slope of attenuation (nBUA) for the clinical assessment of osteoporosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{impact of}} distribution of computed tomography (CT) emphysema on severity of airflow limitation and gas exchange impairment in {{current and former}} heavy smokers participating in a lung cancer screening trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total 875 current and former heavy smokers underwent baseline low-dose CT (30 mAs) in our center and spirometry and diffusion capacity testing {{on the same day}} as part of the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON). Emphysema was quantified for 872 subjects as the number of voxels with an <b>apparent</b> lowered X-ray <b>attenuation</b> coefficient. Voxels attenuated <- 950 HU were categorized as representing severe emphysema (ES 950), while voxels attenuated between - 910 HU and - 950 HU represented moderate emphysema (ES 910). Impact of distribution on severity of pulmonary function impairment was investigated with logistic regression, adjusted for total amount of emphysema. RESULTS: For ES 910 an apical distribution was associated with more airflow obstruction and gas exchange impairment than a basal distribution (both p< 0. 01). The FEV(1) /FVC ratio was 1. 6 % (95 % CI 0. 42 % to 2. 8 %) lower for apical predominance than for basal predominance, for Tlco/V(A) the difference was 0. 12 % (95 % CI 0. 076 - 0. 15 %). Distribution of ES 950 had no impact on FEV(1) /FVC ratio, while an apical distribution was associated with a 0. 076 % (95 % CI 0. 038 - 0. 11 %) lower Tlco/V(A) (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In a heavy smoking population, an apical distribution is associated with more severe gas exchange impairment than a basal distribution; for moderate emphysema it is also associated with a lower FEV(1) /FVC ratio. However, differences are small, and likely clinically irrelevant...|$|R
