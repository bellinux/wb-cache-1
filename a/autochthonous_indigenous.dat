The text, bilingual in Portuguese and Hunsrückisch, one of the varieties of German immigration languages spoken in Brazil, was presented by the authors (as native speakers and translators), in the Legislative Seminar on Creation of the Book of Language Registers, organized by the Institute of National Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), Institute of Investigation and Development in Linguistic Policies (IPOL) and Education and Culture Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, in Brasília, on March 2006. The idea of the Book of Languages contributes to the recognition of Brazilian linguistic diversity, represented by approximately 210 languages, from which 180 are <b>autochthonous</b> (<b>indigenous)</b> and around 30 are allochthonous (of immigration). Its recognition as an immaterial (virtual) cultural heritage is seem as an important act in favor of speakers’ linguistic rights and against linguistic prejudice that comes along {{with the use of}} minority languages in contact with the Portuguese language.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that healthy gut {{microbiota}} is essential to promote host health and well-being. The intestinal microbiota of endothermic animals as well as fish are classified as <b>autochthonous</b> or <b>indigenous,</b> when they are able to colonize the host's epithelial surface or are associated with the microvilli, or as allochthonous or transient (associated with digesta or are present in the lumen). Furthermore, the gut microbiota of aquatic animals is more fluidic than that of terrestrial vertebrates and is highly sensitive to dietary changes. In fish, it is demonstrated that [a] dietary form (live feeds or pelleted diets), [b] dietary lipid (lipid levels, lipid sources and polyunsaturated fatty acids), [c] protein sources (soybean meal, krill meal and other meal products), [d] functional glycomic ingredients (chitin and cellulose), [e] nutraceuticals (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics and immunostimulants), [f] antibiotics, [g] dietary iron and [h] chromic oxide affect the gut microbiota. Furthermore, some information is available on bacterial colonization of the gut enterocyte surface as a result of dietary manipulation which indicates that changes in indigenous microbial populations may have repercussion on secondary host-microbe interactions. The effect of dietary components on the gut microbiota is important to investigate, as the gastrointestinal tract has been suggested as one of the major routes of infection in fish. Possible interactions between dietary components and the protective microbiota colonizing the digestive tract are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Beach sand is {{a habitat}} that {{supports}} many microbes, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa (micropsammon). The apparently inhospitable conditions of beach sand environments belie the thriving communities found there. Physical factors, {{such as water}} availability and protection from insolation; biological factors, such as competition, predation, and biofilm formation; and nutrient availability all contribute to {{the characteristics of the}} micropsammon. Sand microbial communities include <b>autochthonous</b> species/phylotypes <b>indigenous</b> to the environment. Allochthonous microbes, including fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and waterborne pathogens, are deposited via waves, runoff, air, or animals. The fate of these microbes ranges from death, to transient persistence and/or replication, to establishment of thriving populations (naturalization) and integration in the autochthonous community. Transport of the micropsammon within the habitat occurs both horizontally across the beach, and vertically from the sand surface and ground water table, as well as at various scales including interstitial flow within sand pores, sediment transport for particle-associated microbes, and the large-scale processes of wave action and terrestrial runoff. The concept of beach sand as a microbial habitat and reservoir of FIB and pathogens has begun to influence our thinking about human health effects associated with sand exposure and recreational water use. A variety of pathogens have been reported from beach sands, and recent epidemiology studies have found some evidence of health risks associated with sand exposure. Persistent or replicating populations of FIB and enteric pathogens have consequences for watershed/beach management strategies and regulatory standards for safe beaches. This review summarizes our understanding of the community structure, ecology, fate, transport, and public health implications of microbes in beach sand. It concludes with recommendations for future work in this vastly under-studied area...|$|R
40|$|As an {{ecological}} niche, the mammalian intestine provides the ideal habitat {{for a variety}} of bacterial microorganisms. Purportedly, some commensal genera and species offer a beneficial mix of metabolic, protective, and structural processes that help sustain the natural digestive health of the host. Among these sort of gut inhabitants is the Gram-positive lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus ruminis, a strict anaerobe with both pili and flagella on its cell surface, but also known for being <b>autochthonous</b> (<b>indigenous)</b> to the intestinal environment. Given that the molecular basis of gut autochthony for this species is largely unexplored and unknown, we undertook a study at the genome level to pinpoint some of the adaptive traits behind its colonization behavior. In our pan-genomic probe of L. ruminis, the genomes of nine different strains isolated from human, bovine, porcine, and equine host guts were compiled and compared for in silico analysis. For this, we conducted a geno-phenotypic assessment of protein-coding genes, with an emphasis on those products involved with cell-surface morphology and anaerobic fermentation and respiration. We also categorized and examined the core and accessory genes that define the L. ruminis species and its strains. Here, we made an attempt to identify those genes having ecologically relevant phenotypes that might support or bring about intestinal indigenousness...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Christianity and <b>autochthonous</b> (<b>indigenous,</b> pre-Christian) worldviews and practices amongst the Aandonga of Owamboland, Northern Namibia. Using participant contributions {{from a series of}} Contextual Bible Study (CBS) sessions (with groups of men, women, and children), and supplemented by ethnographic contextualisation, it challenges the oft-contended notion that Christian worldviews and practices have erased the significance of African Traditional Religion for Ndonga (or wider Owambo) communities. The enduring significance of autochthonous worldviews and practices is explored using responses to six biblical texts, each of which relates to at least one of three themes: bodies, spirits, and landscapes. The study examines feasting bodies (The Parable of the Wedding Banquet), bleeding bodies (The Haemorrhaging Woman), and possessed bodies (Legion). It considers possession spirits (Legion), natural spirits (the so-called ‘Nature Miracles’), and ancestor spirits (Resurrection appearances). Perspectives on landscapes are highlighted particularly in relation to aspects of the natural environment (the ‘Nature Miracles’) and the locations explored by an itinerant demoniac (Legion). Responses to the texts engender, inter alia, discussions of contemporary perspectives on diviner-healers (oonganga), witchcraft (uulodhi), the homestead (egumbo), burial grounds (omayendo, oompampa), spirits (iiluli, oompwidhuli), ancestors (aathithi), material agency (for example, apotropaic amulets), and the ‘traditional’ wedding (ohango). Having analysed the ways in which autochthonous worldviews informed participants’ interpretations of the particular texts considered (Matthew 22 : 1 - 14 & Luke 14 : 7 - 11; Mark 5 : 21 - 43; Luke 8 : 26 - 39; Mark 4 : 35 - 41 & 6 : 45 - 52; Luke 24), each set of interpretations is brought into conversation with professional biblical scholarship. The study therefore highlights the ways in which these grassroots, ‘contextual’ interpretations might nuance New Testament interpretations returned by the Academy, particularly by highlighting the highly contextual nature of the latter.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{extent of}} the genetic {{polymorphism}} of the HLA complex is becoming well characterized in Basque population and their subpopulations. This level of knowledge mainly concerns HLA class I loci. However, Basque population surveys dealing with HLA class II genes and/or microsatellites in the HLA region are still very scarce. AIM: The population genetics of three highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci, D 6 S 105, D 6 S 265 and TNFa, from HLA region has been analysed in <b>autochthonous</b> (<b>indigenous)</b> Basques from Northern Navarre (Spain). The same blood samples have been typed for HLA class II genes from DQ/DR/DP regions and some findings from that information can be found therein. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were taken from 107 unrelated autochthonous Basques from Northern Navarre. The criterion used to define Northern Navarrese identity was that of three generations of Basque surnames and birthplaces. RESULTS: The main features observed in Navarrese Basques were the rather high frequencies of alleles D 6 S 105 * 4 and D 6 S 265 * 7. A novel allele has been detected at the D 6 S 265 locus (13 : 145 bp). The most frequent haplotype was D 6 S 105 * 8 -D 6 S 265 * 4 with a highly significant linkage disequilibrium being presented. The high frequency of allele TNFa* 1 in Basques is noteworthy and this characteristic is not shared by other European populations, where TNFa* 1 is absent or shows negligible values. The multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) for TNFa allele frequencies has shown a high variability among populations and that alleles TNFa* 1 (F(ST) = 0. 0615) and TNFa* 12 (F(ST) = 0. 0424) seem to have significant influence over the spatial population configuration. TNFa* 2 showed the lowest FST value (0. 0077) because of its conspicuous homogeneous distribution all over the European populations. CONCLUSIONS: Findings shown here on HLA microsatellites and their relationships with other HLA class I and class II genes in Basques can be helpful for those studies mainly addressed at detecting associations between HLA genes and diseases in the Basque area as a whole, and particularly in its autochthonous population, settled there since remote times...|$|E
40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is a dynamic}} ecosystem composed of an organized matrix of host eukaryotic cells, including a fully functional immune system, and numerous microbial habitats normally colonized by a diverse array of microbes. Recent analyses of the gastrointestinal microbiota by use of molecular-based methods indicate that bacterial populations vary substantially among but appear relatively stable within individuals. These observations raise many important questions {{about the role of}} the normal microbiota in the development of both the innate and the adaptive immune systems of the host and about how perturbations in this rela-tionship may contribute to various intestinal or immunologic disorders. Here, 3 critical issues pertaining to the intestinal microbiota are briefly reviewed: what are the microbes, where are the microbes, and what controls the composition of the microbiota. The complex relationship between the animal host and the apathogenic, <b>indigenous</b> (<b>autochthonous)</b> micro-biota residing in its gastrointestinal (GI) tract presents an intriguing immunological paradox.

40|$|In Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada {{stated that}} ss. 35 (1) is “a solemn {{commitment}} {{that must be}} given meaningful content” the objective {{of which is to}} ensure that Aboriginal rights “are taken seriously. ” Despite such a clear directive from the highest court, in Manitoba Métis Federation v. Canada [2007], MacInnes J. of the Queen’s Bench of Manitoba seemed incapable of taking seriously the Aboriginal title of the Métis under s. 31 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, and in no way thought of its explicit recognition as ‘a solemn commitment that must be given meaningful content’. For his part, if Scott C. J. of the Manitoba Court of Appeal was able to find a ‘cognizable Aboriginal interest’ in the expression ‘Indian title’, and thereby recognize to some extent Métis Aboriginal rights, he seemed incapable of conceiving such interests as title. This thesis is basically an attempt to ‘take seriously’ the common law Aboriginal title of the Métis. In order to do so, it first looks at the treatment of the concept of Indian title and the Royal Proclamation, 1763, in the lower courts throughout the infamous St. Catharine’s Milling and Lumber case. Subsequently, the existing common law doctrines of inherent Métis rights, those of the derivative rights doctrine, the empty box doctrine and the distinct Aboriginal people doctrine are all found to be inadequate to the task of providing cogency to the ‘constitutional imperative’ that was evoked in Powley. A fourth doctrine is therefore proposed, that of a Métis <b>Autochthonous</b> or <b>Indigenous</b> rights doctrine. In light of this, it is argued that the recognition of the ‘Indian’ title in s. 31 was not a mere ‘political expediency’ but is rooted in the underlying constitutional principle of the protection of minorities. Furthermore, insofar as the ‘Indian’ title of the Métis is taken seriously, it can be seen as having been extinguished through the federal power over ‘lands reserved for Indians’ under ss. 91 (24). The legal implication is that they were, in the logic of the times, basically enfranchised ‘Indians’. Finally, by applying the grid established in Sioui for determining the existence of a ‘treaty’, it is argued that s. 31 is a ‘treaty’ or land claims settlement within the meaning of s. 35...|$|R
40|$|The barophilic deep-sea bacterium, isolate CNPT- 3, was inactivated by {{exposures}} to temperatures between 10 and 32 °C at atmospheric pressure. Inactivation in samples from warmed cell suspensions was measured as {{the loss of}} colonyforming ability (CFA) at 10 °C and 587 bars. At atmospheric pressure, there was a slow loss of CFA even at 10 °C. The loss of CFA was rapid above 20 °C and only slightly affected by high pressures. The first-order rate constants for thermal inactivation fit the Arrhenius equation with an activation energy of 43 kcal (ca. 179. 9 kJ) /mol. Light microscopy and {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} revealed morphological changes due to warming of the cells. The changes ensued the loss of CFA. The results supported the hypothesis from an earlier work that <b>indigenous</b> (<b>autochthonous)</b> deep-sea bacteria from cold deep seas are both barophilic and psychrophilic. If ultimately sustained, these characteristics may be useful in designing experiments to assess the relative importance of the autochthonous and allochthonous bacteria in the deep sea. The data were used to evaluate how barophilic bacteria may have been missed in many investigations because of warming of the cells during sample retrieval from the sea or during cultivation in the laboratory. The evaluation revealed the need for temperature and pressure data during retrieval of samples and cultivation in the laboratory.

40|$|While the {{discourse}} of multiculturalism in Mexico has begun to supplant or at least compete with the official ideology of mestizaje that has defined Mexican national character as a mixture of European and Indian elements, increased visibility of indigenous ethnic groups has not brought recognition of Afro-Mexican people and culture. In black communities of the Costa Chica on the Pacific Coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero a movement has sought to reverse this historic marginalization through performance of music and dance. While most participants and observers have perceived “survivals ” of African traditions in these performances, my research suggests that these public spectacles are better understood as creative appropriations of <b>autochthonous</b> Mexican and <b>indigenous</b> materials and repertoire. This process is congruent with dynamics observed in other African diasporic communities, most strikingly in black pueblos on the Pacific coast of Peru. My work seeks to explain how, while the specific repertories may be generic, these performances are clearly understood as reproducing and reinforcing racial categories.

40|$|People on {{the island}} of Gaua in {{northern}} Vanuatu have witnessed a series of demographic transformations over the past one hundred years, from Anglican mission-driven resettlement to more recent regional migrations from nearby islands. The distinctions which organized social life in Gaua's past have given way to a new division between indigenous landowning families and various communities of non-indigenous "renters," people from elsewhere permanently settled in the island's east. Kastom, the category of worldviews and associated practices regarded as <b>autochthonous,</b> has provided <b>indigenous</b> Gauans with a sense of cultural-historical continuity {{in the face of such}} extensive change. This dissertation examines two interrelated fields of action and experience [...] ethics and human-environment interaction [...] to address questions of how kastom provides continuity and how it is challenged by the exigencies of contemporary life in a small subsistence society in insular Melanesia. Indigenous Gauans describe a set of ethical capacities and responsibilities which are particular to them as kastom persons [...] that is, as "persons of the place" who trace local tribal connections to land and to each other. Such persons perceive shared human- ontological traits of situational risk and frailty as catalysts for ethical responsibility, fulfilled through expressions of care made possible through productive subsistence work. They understand situational vulnerability as moments of possibility for creating and maintaining social relations, producing meaningful futures for self and others, and affirming identities as autochthonous persons with unique moral attributes. Recent changes to subsistence regimes, owing to such factors as NGO-led conservation initiatives, shifting climatological patterns, and the introduction of new fishing technologies, have motivated concerns about another type of vulnerability [...] that of local ecologies to anthropogenic disturbance. Discourses of ecological vulnerability, disseminated by external agencies and locally transformed, tend to reduce Gaua's residents to uniform statuses of "stakeholder" or "vulnerable subject. " These discourses and their associated practices erase ethically relevant distinctions among persons with respect to the productive capacities and responsibilities comprehended as kastom. For indigenous Gauans, kastom emerges as the precarious space for possibility [...] the locus of struggle for cultural- historical continuity i a changing social and ecological landscap...|$|R
