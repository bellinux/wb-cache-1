25|$|Girls {{from the}} age of five to women aged eighty have been {{assaulted}} and sexually mutilated. Others were raped and their families forced to watch. By 2008 the United Nations (UN) had estimated that up to 200,000 females had suffered from some form of sexual violence. The brutality of the rapes have caused long term health, social, familial, and psychological problems. There have been reports of infants aged one being raped, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>women</b> in their nineties. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported that over 50 percent of survivors believed that the use of rape was a deliberate tactic used for the extermination of the Congolese people.|$|E
25|$|Marie de Romieu’s {{discourse}} is closely based {{on part of}} a 1554 work by Charles Estienne, titled Paradoxes, which are notions contrary to the common opinion. Estienne’s work, in turn, was itself based on Paradoxes, a work by Italian humanist author Ortensio Lando. Lando’s piece was mainly a list of “exemplary ladies”, while Estienne builds onto that by omitting some Italian names and adding some French ladies to it. De Romieu, however, took it further. She follows Estienne’s prose, adding women she thought were deserving of praise. She paid {{special attention to the}} role of educated women, especially her contemporary female poets, praising in her Discourse other French female writers, such as Catherine de Clermont, Marguerite de Navarre, and Madeleine and Catherine des Roches. Notably, she removed the names of women who were entirely devoted to serving their husbands, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>women</b> who attempted to hide their accomplishments from public view.|$|E

25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>women.</b> However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E

500|$|Middle-class {{black women}} activists were {{organized}} through African American Baptist and Methodist churches, {{and under the}} leadership of Hallie Quinn Brown who formed a statewide umbrella group, the Indiana Association of Colored Women's Clubs. Racism prevented the organization from association with its white counterpart the Indiana State Federation of Women's Organizations. White Hoosier suffragist May Wright Sewall spoke at the founding convention in a show of solidarity with Black Hoosier women. The Indiana Association of Colored Women's Clubs sponsored 56 clubs in 46 cities in the state, with 2000 members by 1933, and a budget of over $20,000. Most members were public school teachers or hairdressers, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>women</b> active and local business in the black community, and in government positions. They affiliated with the National Federation of Afro-American Women, headed by Mrs. Booker T. Washington, and became part of her husband's powerful network of black activists. One of the most prominent members in Indiana was Madame C. J. Walker of Indianapolis, who owned a nationally successful business selling beauty and hair products for black women. Club meetings focused on home-making classes, research, and statistics regarding the status of African Americans in Indiana and nationwide, suffrage, and anti-lynching activism. The local clubs operated rescue missions, nursery schools, and educational programs.|$|E

500|$|At age 12, Divine and {{his parents}} moved to Lutherville, a Baltimore suburb, where he {{attended}} Towson High School, graduating in 1963.

[...] Due to this horticultural interest, at 15 he took a part-time job at a local florist's shop. Several years later, he went on a diet that enabled him to drop in weight from , giving him {{a new sense of}} confidence.

He helped out at his parents' day care business, for instance dressing up as Santa Claus to entertain the children at Christmas time. In 1963, he began attending the Marinella Beauty School, where he learned hair styling and, after completing his studies, gained employment at a couple of local salons, specializing in the creation of beehives and other upswept hairstyles. Milstead eventually gave up his job and for a while was financially supported by his parents, who catered to his expensive taste in clothes and cars.

Similarly, Michael Zelenko of The Fader described her character as an aristocrat [...] "in desperate need of physical attention" [...] and noted similarities with the film True Lies in the strip scene. John Boone from E! Online praised the overall sexiness of the video and the singer's look in various scenes. Hailing the video [...] "steamy", Dan Reilly of Spin noted the variety of revealing outfits worn by Beyoncé and concluded [...] "here's no nudity, but the video certainly comes close". Writing on behalf of Vanity Fair, Michelle Collins stated in her review, [...] "If you're a fan of gorgeously choreographed burlesque routines, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>women</b> in their thirties who defy the logic of cellulite, 'Partition' is a good starting off point in your journey through Beyoncé's 'Beyoncé.'"
