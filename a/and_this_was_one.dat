5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings {{were found to be}} effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} other, smaller groups {{not related to}} the moderates of which the most {{important}} were the restorationists (or Caramurus) who called for the return of Pedro I as regent for his son. Beyond the need to fight the restorationist threat the only other common interest uniting the Nativists and the Coimbra bloc into the Moderate Party was their support of federalism. The Brazilian constitution was overly centralized <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the main reasons behind their opposition to the former emperor who was openly against any constitutional amendment. The Moderate Party believed that by granting more autonomy to the provinces it could placate discontent and extinguish any separatist threat.|$|E

25|$|How Green Was My Valley {{became one}} of the biggest films of 1941. It was {{nominated}} for ten Academy Awards including Best Supporting Actress (Sara Allgood), Best Editing, Best Script, Best Music and Best Sound and it won five Oscars—Best Director, Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Donald Crisp), Best B Cinematography (Arthur C. Miller) and Best Art Direction/Interior Decoration. It was a huge hit with audiences, coming in behind Sergeant York as the second-highest-grossing film {{of the year in the}} USA and taking almost $3million against its sizable budget of $1,250,000. Ford was also named Best Director by the New York Film Critics, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the few awards of his career that he collected in person (he generally shunned the Oscar ceremony).|$|E
500|$|Negus became President of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists in 1951, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of {{a number}} of presidencies he held, {{including}} that of the Thoracic Society (1949–50) and the Fourth International Congress of Otolaryngology. The latter was a large event that took place in London over a week in July 1949. It was held in the Great Hall of King's College, London, and was attended by over 700 otolaryngology specialists from 39 countries. The patron was King George VI and the congress was opened by the Duchess of Kent. Negus was President and host for the 1954 annual meeting of the Collegium Oto-rhino-laryngologicum Amicitiae Sacrum (CORLAS), held in London from 29 August to 1 September, and was the treasurer of CORLAS from 1936 to 1950. Negus was also associated with, and gave talks to, numerous medical societies in the UK and abroad, with his connections ranging from honorary fellowships to corresponding and honorary memberships. These foreign societies included the American Broncho-Esophagological Association, and the countries included Sweden, Denmark, Canada, the USA, Austria, France, Italy, Hungary, and Turkey. Bateman opined in his obituary of Negus that it seemed unlikely that any other British ENT surgeon [...] "has been honoured by so many societies".|$|E
500|$|The final {{match of}} the series was drawn, mainly because the pitch heavily favoured batting. MacLaren was {{involved}} in another selection controversy when the fast bowler Claude Buckenham was {{left out of the}} England team at his instigation. The Wisden match report described this decision as [...] "so grave a blunder {{that it is difficult to}} find words in which to speak of it." [...] The Wisden editor, Sydney Pardon, commented: [...] "A fatal blunder was committed in leaving out Buckenham—a blunder for which it was generally understood that MacLaren was responsible. Experts occasionally do strange things <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the strangest. The idea of letting England go into the field in fine weather, on a typical Oval wicket, with no fast bowler except Sharp touched the confines of lunacy." [...] Further issues arose over MacLaren's handling of his bowlers, and Wisden suggested [...] "MacLaren was sadly at fault in his management of the England bowling". Douglas Carr, a 37-year-old, was called into the team after some success in preceding games and on the premise that the Australians would be unable to play his googly. After Carr had initial success, MacLaren kept him bowling for a long period until the player tired and was easily punished by the batsmen. In his only innings, MacLaren scored 12, and when the match ended, much of the blame for England's failures was apportioned to him. In the series, he scored 85 runs at 12.14. The Oval match was his final Test match; in 35 games he had scored 1,931 runs at 33.87. He ended the season with 613 runs at 19.77.|$|E

Antonioni usually only used diegetic music in his films <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the last times that he (briefly) included a musical score for scenes other than during the credits. For L'avventura, Antonioni asked Fusco to compose [...] "jazz {{as though it had}} been written in the Hellenic era." ...|$|E
2500|$|Accepted on a {{national}} scale, Christianity was also successful among different social groups from the poor to the rich, peasants, traders, sailors, warriors, or courtesans. [...] Most of the daily activities of the Church were done by Japanese from the beginning, giving the Japanese Church a native face, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> {{of the reasons for}} its success. [...] By 1590, there were seventy native brothers in Japan, fully one half of Jesuits in Japan and fifteen percent of all Jesuits who were working in Asia.|$|E

Compared to the {{variants}} {{found among}} Eskimo groups of America, shamanism among Siberian Yupiks stressed more {{the importance of}} maintaining good relationship with sea animals. Ungazighmiit people (the largest of Siberian Yupik variants) had s, who received presents for the shamanizing, healing. This payment had a special name, [...] — in their language, there were many words for {{the different kinds of}} presents and payments <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of them. (The many kinds of presents and the words designating them were related to the culture: fests, marriage etc.; or made such fine distinctions like [...] "thing, given to someone who has none", [...] "thing, given, not begged for", [...] "thing, given to someone as to anybody else", [...] "thing, given for exchange" [...] etc.).|$|E

2500|$|How {{quickly the}} towers were built is controversial. Poyntz Wright {{estimates}} {{one or two}} years. John H. Harvey believes a construction rate of [...] per year, allowing for gradual settlement, is more in accord with known medieval tower construction rates. The towers were commissioned by wealthy benefactors and parishes as a testament to their faith, {{as well as a}} highly visible sign of wealth and status. Nikolaus Pevsner notes {{that at the end of}} the 14th century, Somerset was producing a quarter of the wool products made in England <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the sources of wealth that produced the Somerset towers. The boom in wool led to a comparable, though architecturally rather different, wave of equally extravagant parish churches in 15th century Suffolk. An additional source of support for some of the Somerset churches would have been close ties to nearby monasteries in Muchelney, Athelney, Glastonbury and Bath.|$|E
2500|$|The script of [...] "Band of Brothers" [...] {{describes}} Darius as a monk with a [...] "hideously ugly face", {{but when}} the producers cast the part, they chose German actor Werner Stocker, who did not fit this description. Abramowitz explains, [...] "Darius, originally in the script, was written as almost {{to look like the}} Hunchback of Notre Dame, to be physically ugly and with a glorious soul. And when I got to France, I noticed that they cast this young, handsome German actor named Werner Stocker. I said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on here? He's supposed to be ugly.' And it seemed that the Germans, who were putting up a great deal of money, didn't want the only German actor in the show to be ugly; so he wasn't ugly. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the cases where politics won out and it didn't hurt anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diaochan {{was one of}} the Four Beauties {{of ancient}} China. Unlike the other three beauties, however, there is no known {{evidence}} suggesting her existence; she is mostly a fictional character. It was mentioned in Chinese historical records that Lü Bu had a secret affair with one of Dong Zhuo's maids and was constantly afraid of being discovered, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons why Lü Bu killed Dong Zhuo in 192. However, the maid's name was not recorded in history. Diaochan is best known for her role in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, she had a romance with the warrior Lü Bu and caused him to betray and kill his foster father, the tyrannical warlord Dong Zhuo. The name [...] "Diaochan", which literally means [...] "sable cicada", {{is believed to have been}} derived from the sable tails and jade decorations in the shape of cicadas which adorned the hats of high-ranking officials in the Eastern Han dynasty.|$|E
