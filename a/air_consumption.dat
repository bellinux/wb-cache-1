This requires the ability to achieve neutral buoyancy {{at any time during}} a dive, otherwise the effort expended to maintain depth by swimming against the buoyancy difference will both task load the diver and require an otherwise unnecessary expenditure of energy, increasing <b>air</b> <b>consumption,</b> and increasing the risk of loss of control and escalation to an accident.|$|E
25|$|A {{pattern of}} two breaths per diver should be {{established}} {{as soon as possible}} and then terminate the dive and start the ascent as soon as possible, as <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> while buddy breathing is usually more than double the normal rate. Most demand valves will only drain correctly if the hose is to the user's right, and in these cases the divers should align themselves to allow convenient movement of the demand valve from donor to recipient and back. When the divers need to ascend or swim horizontally, it requires co-ordination and some skill, which is best practiced in a low hazard environment.|$|E

In normal conditions this will be between 10 and 25 litres per minute (L/min) for divers who are not working hard. At times of extreme high work rate, breathing rates can rise to 95 litres per minute. For International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) commercial diving gas planning purposes, a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used, whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies. RMV is controlled by blood CO2 levels, and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures, so does not change with depth. The very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long the supply will last, and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible. Scuba divers are expected to monitor the remaining gas pressure sufficiently often that they are aware of how much is still available at all times during a dive.|$|E

2500|$|Occasionally a diver may be towed using a [...] "sled", an {{unpowered}} device towed {{behind a}} surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance {{to be covered}} for a given <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> and bottom time.

2500|$|Breathing gas management: The {{breathing}} {{gas supply}} must last the diver until {{out of the}} overhead environment. There are several strategies for gas management. The most common protocol is the 'rule of thirds,' in which {{one third of the}} initial gas supply is used for ingress, one third for egress, and one third to support another team member {{in the case of an}} emergency. This is a very simple method, but is not always sufficient. UK practice is to adhere to the rule of thirds, but with an added emphasis on keeping depletion of the separate air systems [...] "balanced," [...] so that the complete loss of any single gas supply will still leave the diver with sufficient gas to return safely. The rule of thirds makes no allowance for increased <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> that the stress caused by the loss of an air system may induce. Dissimilar tank sizes among the divers are also not allowed for by the rule of thirds, and a sufficient reserve should be calculated for each dive. UK practice is to assume that each diver is completely independent, as in a typical UK sump there is usually nothing that a buddy can do to assist a diver in trouble. Most UK cave divers dive solo. US sump divers follow a similar protocol. The rule of thirds was devised as an approach to diving Florida's caves - they typically have high outflow currents, which help to reduce <b>air</b> <b>consumption</b> when exiting. In a cave system with little or no outflow it is prudent to reserve more air than is provided by the rule of thirds.|$|E
