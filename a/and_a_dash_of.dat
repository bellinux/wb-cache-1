However Evelyn Waugh declared that the Drones did not resemble any real club in 1920s London.|$|E

500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Overlord" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of IGN described [...] "Overlord" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} series of missions that the franchise has yet seen." [...] Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer opined that the pack [...] "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected duck-and-cover combat with openworld exploration <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> environmental puzzling, all {{wrapped up in a}} story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale." [...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that [...] "a few of the larger environments let you take on [...] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of Mass Effect 2s battles." [...] He also praised the final boss battle, which was said to exceed that of the main game.|$|E
500|$|Ben Hogwood from musicOMH {{declared}} the song as [...] "top notch, diamond-encrusted pop" [...] {{along with other}} tracks like [...] "Starstruck" [...] and [...] "Paparazzi". He found the lyrics to be sometimes odd, especially the statement, [...] "I'm on a mission, and it involves some heavy touchin'." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe said that the song [...] "has a gutter level quippage with sinuous moves". Priya Elan from The Times was not impressed with the song and called it calculated. Billboard music editor Chris Williams gave the song a positive review, commenting that [...] "It has all the winning ingredients of its predecessors: a radio-friendly, club/electropop feel; a provocative, yet silly enough catchphrase and hook; <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> '80s synth magic, so the adults can play along. On 'LoveGame' Gaga is in it to win it." ...|$|E
500|$|Spector, {{also in the}} album's 1957 liner notes, {{reported}} on another of Angelou's concerts in the Beverly Hills nightclub The Keyboard, when she performed many of the songs on Miss Calypso. [...] He called her a polite, soft-spoken, calm, and poised young woman [...] "that completely mystified the audience". [...] He found that Angelou's performance made an indelible impression {{and that she had}} an unusual voice and striking appearance. [...] Spector stated, [...] "She had captured the audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner", and promised that she would do the same for listeners of the album. [...] He also predicted that she was [...] "destined to become a very big name in show business". [...] Spector characterized Angelou's music as [...] "calypso style with a liberal sprinkling of Afro-Cuban, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> blues mixed together with delicate jazz".|$|E

500|$|Among mixed reviews, Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticized A Ghost Is Born as [...] "wildly uneven" [...] and [...] "less {{cohesive}} {{than any}} other Wilco release." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau called it a [...] "privileged self-indulgence" [...] due to its extreme musical dynamics. NME wrote of the album: [...] "It's like Scissor Sisters on tranquilisers. With a bit of ELO. <b>And</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Ramones. And, with this eclecticism, a worrying lack of focus." [...] Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune felt that the album possessed an [...] "incomplete" [...] quality which nonetheless can be [...] "quite intriguing, more of a side step than a forward leap, but a worthy experiment all the same." [...] Ann Powers of Blender wrote that on first listen, the album is [...] "rather monotonous, a bunch of moderately singable tunes with some noise piled up around the edges", but that it [...] "starts to insinuate meaning" [...] over subsequent listens.|$|E

5000|$|Film Threat {{claimed that}} the uncut release was [...] "completely loaded to the teeth with nerve-wracking suspense, an {{atmosphere}} of sheer dread, stomach turning gore <b>and</b> just <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> black humor.
