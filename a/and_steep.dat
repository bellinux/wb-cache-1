5|$|The Maclennan Hill was a {{dangerous}} <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> bottleneck for traffic leaving the inner city. The first recommendations involved creating an underpass beneath the CPR tracks.

5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and ridges of sandstone.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, the {{automobile}} gradually became the primary form of transportation. Motorists crossing the Pennsylvania mountains during the 1930s {{were limited to}} hilly, winding roads such as the Lincoln Highway (US30) or the William Penn Highway (US22), which had grades exceeding nine percent. Due to their sharp curves <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> grades, the roads were dangerous and caused many fatal accidents from skids.|$|E

5|$|The Altoona Northern {{initially}} purchased three ex-PRR 2-6-0s (built at Juniata Shops), numbered #101–103. They {{were found}} to be unsuitable for the light track <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> grades, and were sold in 1917. They were replaced by #104 and #105, new two-truck Heislers, and the railroad bought #106, a three-truck Heisler, in 1918. They were sold to various lumber companies when the railroad was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more rugged and consists of rolling hills, plains, ravines, <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> flat-topped hills called buttes. These buttes sometimes rise 400 to 600feet (120 to 180m) above the plains. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands.|$|E
5|$|The prehistoric {{breakup of}} the supercontinent Gondwana {{separated}} the Madagascar–Antarctica–India landmass from the Africa–South America landmass around 135million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Along {{the length of the}} eastern coast runs a narrow <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> escarpment containing much of the island's remaining tropical lowland forest.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp bend in the creek is constricted between crowded development <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E

5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the curve of the Chilton.|$|E
5|$|Often {{compared}} to San Francisco {{due to the}} hilly terrain <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that {{do not meet the}} current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E

In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell {{to the bottom of}} a large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was {{incorporated}} on 31 July 1845 and, having acquired the Blaenavon Tramroad {{in the same}} year, it rebuilt and extended the line, which re-opened from Pontypool to Blaenavon (North) on 2 October 1854. Two short <b>and</b> <b>steep</b> branches to Cwmfrwdoer and Cwmnantddu were opened in 1870, with a third to Abersychan and Talywain in 1879. A 99-year lease of the line was granted to the Great Western Railway from 1 August 1875 and the railway company acquired the line on 1 August 1880.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river was tall <b>and</b> <b>steep,</b> forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials {{on that side of the}} river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E
