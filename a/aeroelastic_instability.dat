40|$|The {{impact of}} {{aeroelasticity}} and structural dynamics {{on the design}} of flight vehicles is apparent when considering the entire time- dependent environment in which these vehicles operate. Aircraft are subjected to maneouvre, gust, and landing loads, and must be freeof flutter and other <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> throughout the flight envelope. Space vehicles are subjected to release transient loads and aeroacoustic loads at lift-off and must be free of control instabilities. Moreover, they must retarget rapidly and quickly settle from a vibratory condition to a quiet functional state. Rotorcraft, because of their highly-flexible rotating parts, are subjected to strong, periodically unsteady aerodynamic excitations, and also the bladings of advanced turbofan engines may strongly suffer from structural vibrations and <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The ability to predict these effects - which belong to the coupled effects - is essential for the design of safe and economically viable high-performance flight vehicles of the future. In this keynote paper, as an introductory contribution to this Forum, current challenging problem areas in aeroelasticity which deal with coupled problems are pointed out and the impetus of unsteady computational aerodynamics in the development of advanced aeroelastic computational simulation is highlighted.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} suppression of aeroelastic instabilities {{by means of}} broadband passive targeted energy transfers has been recently studied. A single-degree-offreedom (SDOF) nonlinear energy sink (NES) was coupled to a 2 -DOF rigid wing modeled in the low-speed, subsonic regime with quasi-steady aerodynamic theory. The nonlinear attachment was designed and optimized to suppress the critical nonlinear modal energy exchanges between the flow and the (pitch and heave) wing modes, thus suppressing the (transient) triggering mechanism of <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>instability.</b> We performed bifurcation analysis to find regions of robust passive aeroelastic suppression in parameter space. Then, we employed multi-degreeof-freedom nonlinear energy sinks (MDOF NESs) to improve robustness of the <b>aeroelastic</b> <b>instability</b> suppression. Bifurcation analysis by a numerical continuation technique demonstrated that controlling the occurrence of a limit point cycle (LPC or saddle-node) bifurcation point above a Hopf bifurcation point is crucial to enhancing suppression robustness.
