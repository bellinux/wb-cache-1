50|$|Cheetah Records {{was started}} in Orlando, Florida by Tom Reich in 1988 and {{distributed}} music belonging primarily to the rap music subgenera Miami Bass. Cheetah started small with Reich selling tapes {{out of the trunk}} of his car. Cheetah’s growth accelerated after Orlando native DJ Magic Mike was signed to the label and quickly generated most of Cheetah’s sales. Other acts including Radioactive Goldfish (old school Techno) and Schnitt Acht (Heavy metal) were also handled by Cheetah but they failed to match the sales volume generated by Magic Mike. Reich later started two <b>addition</b> <b>record</b> labels: Bush Baby Records and Magic Records, where the later featured Magic Mike exclusively. All three record labels were later consolidated under the Cheetah Distribution Group (CDG). Some people claim that the CDG was the largest independently distributed record label in America at that time. Magic Mike left Cheetah in 1995 and CDG folded in 1996.|$|E
5000|$|A common anti-pattern for {{automated}} {{tests is}} to record and replay real dependent service responses. These recordings are typically complex and shared between multiple tests. This, however, introduces unnecessary coupling between tests and breaks the Single responsibility principle, which, states that every context (class, function, variable, etc.) should define a single responsibility, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the context. Record and replay solutions also break {{down when the}} response changes. For example, if a bookshop service is mocked by recording a response containing a list of 50 books, when the format for a book changes then the recorded response must be updated in 50 places. If a new response is recorded with the new format, most likely, the test assertions {{will need to be}} updated. In <b>addition</b> <b>record</b> and replay approaches hide the data being used in the test from the test code and therefore break encapsulation and separation of concerns. MockServer simplifies the mocking of responses for dependent systems by providing a simple API and client in multiple languages. Each test can then independently encapsulate the data and logic used for mock services, ensuring each test runs independently. In addition such an approach also reduces the time for a suite of test to complete because tests can run in parallel and do not share data.|$|E

5000|$|M2's early programmers {{were quick}} to take {{creative}} advantage of the MTV parent company's hands-off approach, resulting in playful or ironic programming decisions that underscored the upstart channel's early free-wheeling, subversive attitude and proudly [...] "bratty" [...] self-image; for example, on January 1, 1999, M2 played the music video [...] "1999" [...] by Prince for 24 hours straight. Due to its programmers' acumen, M2 quickly gained favor with music insiders, and as its popularity and reputation grew within the music industry, it became common for musicians and record labels to request that their new videos premiere exclusively on M2 rather than MTV. In <b>addition,</b> <b>record</b> companies often asked to have new artists appear on the channel in taped segments with the VJs because M2 viewers were considered tastemakers and early-adopters. Even an act as huge (and seemingly incongruous with M2) as the Spice Girls made their first American TV appearance on M2, as did their video for [...] "Wannabe," [...] which was a number-one hit worldwide. At {{the time of their}} appearance on M2, the Spice Girls were already a huge hit in the UK (and thus were expected to be in the United States), but they were relatively unknown to U.S. audiences, so the hope was that being seen first on M2 would give the group an ironic edge that might help expand their appeal beyond the obvious bubble-gum set (in addition, Pinfeild was a fan of them).|$|E

Indonesia has about 10 % of the world bamboo, 50 % among them was endemic to Indonesia. According Widjaja (2001) Lesser Sunda Island which consists of Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Timor, Sumba and other small island eastern of Flores has 14 bamboo species, however, the information from the Sumba Island was lacking because of lacking data from this area except one species which was proposed by S. Soenarko in 1977 where the type specimens was collected by Iboet 443 in 1925. To fullfill data from the Sumba Island, an exploration to this area has been conducted on July 2003. The observation was done in West Sumba and East Sumba District, especially in two natioal parks at both districts. According to this inventory study in the Sumba Island, there were 10 bamboo species in Sumba Island, 1 species among them (Dinochloa sp.) was a new species which has not been collected before, whereas the other species (Dinochloa kostermansiana) has a new <b>addition</b> <b>record</b> from this area. The bamboo species in Sumba Island were Bambusa blumeana, Bambusa vulgaris, Dendocalamus asper, Dinochloa kostermansiana, Dinochloa sp., Gigantochloa atter, Nastus reholtumianus, Phyllostachys aurea, Schisotachyum brachycladum and Schizostachyum lima. From 10 recorded species, the genera Dinochloa and Nastus grow wild in the forest, whereas another species grow widly or cultivated in the garden. Furthermore, the genus Dinochloa was the only genus grow climbing. The endemic species found in Sumba Island was Nastus reholttumianus, whereas Dinochloa kostermansiana was also found in Flores Island...|$|E

T 7 W 3 2005 In Kenya, the Small and Micro {{enterprise}} {{sector has}} been {{believed to be}} important in supporting economic development for a long time now, with inadequate business management Skills often cited as a major constraint in their growth. 	This study investigates the effects of business management training among women micro entrepreneurs in the Kibera Slum, Nairobi. It specifically seeks to establish the business management practices of the women before the training was, identify the kind of Business management training received by the women., examine the effects of the business management training, on the women and on their businesses and to establish the constraints faced by the women micro-entrepreneurs even after training. A total of 60 respondents mainly from Silanga and Kisumu Ndogo and Lindi, were sampled using stratified random sampling along business types: production, service and retail. They were through face to face interviews, using a structured questionnaire, with In-depth interviews of the 60 respondents being undertaken. The study found that majority of the women improved their business performance, after receiving the training, especially in terms of business returns: sales, profits, as well as on improved customers base. However, critical business management practices such as record keeping and financial management was still poor. Secondly, the study reveals that performance differed greatly when analyzed along variables such as asset base, and number of employees before and after training. It is recommended that future business management trainings ought to be more responsive to specific training needs of women and require that agencies carry out training needs assessment before conducting the Business management training. In <b>addition,</b> <b>record</b> keeping and financial management need to be given considerable attention during the training. Kenyatta Universit...|$|E
