25|$|At {{an unknown}} date {{around the time}} of his accession, the young King Eadwig married Ælfgifu. The union was or was {{to become one of the}} most {{controversial}} royal marriages in 10th-century England. Eadwig's brother Edgar was the heir presumptive, but a legitimate son born out of this marriage would have seriously diminished Edgar’s chances of succeeding to the kingship, especially if both parents were of royal rank. Fostered by Ælfwynn wife of Æthelstan Half-King together with her son Æthelwine, Edgar enjoyed the support of Æthelstan Half-King (d. after 957) and his sons, whose power base was concentrated in Mercia and East Anglia <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have liked to lose power and influence to Ælfgifu's kinsmen and associates. If Hart's suggestion that Ælfgifu was of royal Mercian descent and related to the latter family is correct, it might have been hoped that the marriage would give Eadwig some political advantage in exercising West-Saxon control over Mercia.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|E
2500|$|Moroni is {{associated}} with the [...] "title of liberty", a standard which he raised to rally the Nephites to defend their liberties from a group of dissenters who wanted to establish their leader as a king. Moroni was so angry with Amalickiah's dissention and wicked influence that he tore his coat and wrote upon it, [...] "In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children". With these words, he rallied his people to defend their families and their freedom and drove out the armies of Amalickiah. Moroni put to death any dissenters who did not flee <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> support the cause of freedom, and his “title of liberty” was raised over every Nephite tower.|$|E

2500|$|In the U.S., {{licensing}} {{for healthcare}} professionals {{had all but}} vanished {{around the time of}} the Civil War, leaving the profession open to anyone who felt inclined to become a physician; the market alone determined who would prove successful <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> Medical schools were plentiful, inexpensive and mostly privately owned. With free entry into the profession, and education in medicine cheap and available, many men entered practice, leading to an overabundance of practitioners which drove down the individual physician's income. In 1847, the American Medical Association (AMA) was formed and established higher standards for preliminary medical education and for the MD. At the time, most medical practitioners were unable to meet the stringent standards, so a [...] "grandfather clause" [...] was included. The effect was to limit the number of new practitioners.|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, 1988, the libel {{portion of}} Rosenberg's lawsuit against Cox was dismissed. The ruling did not dismiss the slander {{portion of the}} suit, which dealt with phone calls {{individuals}} received which asked if {{they would vote for}} a political candidate with ties to a [...] "cult" [...] such as Erhard's est organization. Superior Court Commissioner Eleanor M. Palk ceded to the request by attorneys for Cox to dismiss the libel charge, and ruled that the statements included in the mailer sent out by the Cox campaign were within accepted grounds for comments made during a political campaign, and should be treated as opinion protected by the United States Constitution, which could not be characterized as defamatory under law. Of the calls from the Cox campaign received by voters that posed questions about Erhard's organization, Palk stated: [...] "The audience consisted of residents who received unsolicited telephone calls <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> necessarily expect a political message in the guise of what could have been understood to be a poll." ...|$|E
