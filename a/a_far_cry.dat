5|$|McCabe totalled 385 runs at 42.78 for {{the series}} and was the only Australian batsman other than Bradman to score a century, as the English decisively won the series 41. He took three wickets at 71.66, and opened the bowling {{in some of the}} matches due to Australia's lack of fast bowling.

5|$|The match started amid clear weather, <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> {{from the}} {{previous}} Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during World War II, when it was left cratered by German bombing raids. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E

After making 40 and 0 in the First Test win in Madras, he was unable to bat either innings in the Second Test in Bombay after being hospitalised due to persistent vomiting, injury as Australia ceded their series lead. He missed the remainder of the series, the Third Test in Calcutta and a one-off Test in Pakistan. Upon his return home, he has a shortened domestic season before Australia left for the West Indies. In five domestic matches, he scored 357 runs at 59.50, including a 133 not against South Australia.|$|E
5|$|An art {{exhibition}} of Little Busters! {{was held in}} Osaka, Japan between May 3 and May 4, 2007, and in Tokyo, Japan between May 24 and May 25, 2007. A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was in the glove. This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo!

5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But {{it would not be a}} replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from his childhood days when he was too poor to afford a basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact of when the bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered {{at the thought that}} the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E
5|$|The site {{only allowed}} for the {{building}} to be one room deep, as a workhouse and a barracks lay immediately behind. To exacerbate matters, there was a public right of way through the site to these buildings, which accounts for the access porticoes on the eastern and western sides of the façade. These had to incorporate columns from the demolished Carlton House and their relative shortness result in an elevation that was deemed excessively low, and <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the commanding focal point that was desired for {{the northern end of}} the Square. Also recycled are the sculptures on the façade, originally intended for Nash's Marble Arch but abandoned due to his financial problems. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the Gallery.|$|E

5|$|The Darlington's Bridge at Delaware Station was {{a highway}} {{bridge over the}} Delaware River in the {{community}} of Delaware, New Jersey (known locally as Delaware Station). Formerly a railroad bridge constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in 1871 to replace an earlier 1855 timber span, the bridge was sold off when the new one upstream was constructed. Henry V. Darlington, an Episcopal minister in Delaware and nearby Belvidere offered to buy the second-hand bridge for $5,000 (1914 USD, equal to $ today). Darlington converted it into a highway bridge, using two fired members of the nearby Meyer's Ferry to be toll collectors. The bridge prospered, becoming a part of State Highway Route6 in 1927 and U.S. Route46 in 1936. In 1932, during the massive state takeover of bridges by the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, Darlington refused offers, bargaining his way up to $275,000 (1932 USD, equal to $ today) before accepting the sale. This amount was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the nearby Belvidere-Riverton and Portland-Columbia Covered Bridge, which were accepted for $60,000 (equal to $ today) and $50,000 (equal to $ today) respectively. On that moment, tolls along the bridge and Route6 were eliminated. The bridge prospered toll-free for another 21 years, until the construction of the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge upstream at Columbia. Although Reverend Darlington was still alive to see all this transpire, the Commission ceased operations on the Darlington Bridge on April3, 1954, and the bridge was immediately demolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} in March 2004 of issue #300 {{was met with}} a muted, rather than celebratory, response from the comics industry.

25|$|Ponting {{started with}} a 3–0 clean sweep of the Test series in Sri Lanka. Ponting brought Symonds into the Test team {{on the back of}} strong ODI form, rather than {{first-class}} cricket, replacing Simon Katich, who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in the last Test. However, this backfired and Symonds was dropped after two Tests. Nevertheless, it was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from Australia's last two Test campaigns in Sri Lanka, which had resulted in a 1–0 and 0–1 results respectively. Individually though, Ponting struggled, especially in comparison to his efforts in 1999. He scored 198 runs at 33.00, his only effort beyond 30 being 92 in the first innings of the Third Test at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground in Colombo.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{attempts}} at evacuation while {{the war was}} still {{in its early stages}} through early 1942 were <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the organised affair that the Soviet central bureaucracy envisaged. Throughout the summer and fall of 1941, numerous Soviet frontier cities evacuated in a haphazard and panicked fashion before the German onslaught. A number of factors led to this lack of organisation. For one, the Soviet evacuation plans were thrown together fairly hurriedly, {{and a lot of the}} logistical planning was done on the fly as the German advance was already sweeping through the Soviet border zone. The German invasion also hampered the effectiveness of the Soviet response by shattering their communications in the war's early stages; many Soviet leaders were unable to gather reliable information about the positions of German forces until it was too late to effect an orderly evacuation.|$|E
5000|$|On March 28, 2006, Ubisoft {{released}} <b>a</b> sequel, <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox, {{which was}} met with less enthusiasm than the first versions of <b>Far</b> <b>Cry.</b> On the same day, for the Xbox 360, <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> Instincts: Predator was released, which essentially contains both Instincts and Evolution and can run in 720p or 1080i high-definition.

The storyline focuses on Jack Carver's work for a woman named Kade, which results in him being hunted by local governments due to a frame-up during a botched arms deal.

5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was <b>an</b> {{improvement}} over <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, {{but he thought}} that the game felt and played too similarly to <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 did not stray far away from <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|R
60|$|An hour went by, and {{a second}} hour. The pale light of the short sunless day was {{beginning}} to fade, when <b>a</b> faint <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> arose on the still air.

It {{might have been a}} lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind.

25|$|The {{launch of}} the Stock Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS). It was <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the {{original}} system which dated back over 100 years. During that time there had been three different forms of trading on the Australian stock exchanges. The earliest was the auction-based call system, which saw a stock exchange employee (the caller) call the name of each listed security in turn while members bid, offered, sold or bought the stock at each call. This system proved inadequate to handle the increased volume of trading during the mining booms. It {{was replaced by the}} 'post' system in the early 1960s, which involved stocks being quoted on 'posts' or 'boards'. 'Chalkies' were employed by the Stock Exchange and it was their function to record in chalk the bids and offers of the operators (employees of stockbrokers) and the sales made. This system stayed in place until 1991.|$|E
25|$|The Pashtunistan {{issue is}} rarely {{mentioned}} anymore {{as a point}} of disagreement between Afghan and Pakistan officials - <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from the 1950s and 1960s when the issue was considered contentious. There are several arguments from the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan regarding the Pashtunistan issue. These arguments sometimes overlap but can be distinctively defined. The British influence in the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan was most prominent during the late 19th century and early portion of the 20th century, when the British sought to reestablish efforts at colonization during Britain's imperial century. This British experiment was known as The Great Game, and was a subversive attempt at establishing Afghanistan as a buffer zone between British-India and the Tsardom of Russia. By seeking to accord certain terrain international legitimacy based upon British failures to assert control over the fiercely independent Pashtuns and tribes in the region, the establishment of a border that would separate British interests from tribal interests was extremely important to British foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|Lombard {{society was}} divided into classes {{comparable}} {{to those found in}} the other Germanic successor states of Rome, Frankish Gaul and Visigothic Spain. There was a noble class, a class of free persons beneath them, a class of unfree non-slaves (serfs), and finally slaves. The aristocracy itself was poorer, more urbanised, and less landed than elsewhere. Aside from the richest and most powerful of the dukes and the king himself, Lombard noblemen tended to live in cities (unlike their Frankish counterparts) and hold little {{more than twice as much}} in land as the merchant class (<b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>cry</b> from provincial Frankish aristocrats who held vast swathes of land, hundreds of times larger than those beneath his status). The aristocracy by the 8th century was highly dependent on the king for means of income related especially to judicial duties: many Lombard nobles are referred to in contemporary documents as iudices (judges) even when their offices had important military and legislative functions as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of that year, someone stole a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's {{traveling}} musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of <b>an</b> unfinished production (<b>Far</b> <b>Cry),</b> altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{conversation}} over Twitter in 2017 a former artist {{who worked on}} 'Infinite' compared the game series to the <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> series, saying that [...] "I think what makes a Bioshock game, {{or at least a}} good Bioshock game, is that sense of magical realism. I think it's a lot like what Dan Hay said about what he thinks <b>a</b> good <b>Far</b> <b>Cry</b> game is, you know, this sense that this stuff could happen in real life, like someone sits down next to you at a bar or wherever and starts telling you this story that's so fantastic that you're super skeptical, but everything in the story is 100% plausible and you come away feeling like that story was totally legit; with Bioshock, we have the fantastical stories, and the larger than life characters, and if someone were to sit down with you and say something like, [...] "So this one time I was on a plane that crashed into the ocean and I ended up in this creepy fallen city and fought a bunch of druggies", that's totally plausible. What we do is, then, we add magical realism to it, so the fallen city becomes an underwater dystopia, and the druggies become these psychic mutants and people driven insane by using drugs that make them superhumans." ...|$|R
