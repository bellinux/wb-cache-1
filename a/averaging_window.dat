In this study, we investigate the variability of the logarithm of the Monin-Obukhov-scaled structure parameters (denoted as log(2 s)) of temperature and humidity. We use observations from eddy-covariance systems operated at three heights (2. 5, 50, and 90 m) within the atmospheric surface layer under unstable conditions. The variability of log(C 2 s) depends on instability and {{on the size of}} the <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> over which log(C 2 s) is calculated. If instability increases, differences in log(C 2 s) between upward motions (large C 2 s) and downward motions (small C 2 s) increase. The differences are, however, not sufficiently large to result in a bimodal probability density function. If the <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> size increases, the variances of log(C 2 s) decrease. A linear regression of the variances of log(C 2 s) versus the <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> size for various stability classes shows an increase of both the offset and slope (in absolute sense) with increasing instability. For temperature, data from the three heights show comparable results. For humidity, in contrast, the offset and slope are larger at 50 and 90 m than at 2. 5 m. In the end we discuss how these findings could be used to assess whether observed differences in C 2 s along a scintillometer path or aircraft flight leg are just within the range of local variability in C 2 s or could be attributed to surface heterogeneity. This is important for the interpretation of data measured above a heterogeneous surface...|$|E

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) {{are commonly used}} in oceanic and more recently estuarine and riverine environments because they are small, versatile, efficient, moving platforms equipped with a suite of instruments for measuring environmental conditions. However, moving vessel observations, particularly those associated with Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements, can be problematic owing to instrument noise, flow fluctuations, and spatial variability. A range of ADCPs manufactured by different companies were integrated onto an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV), and some additional stationary platforms, and were deployed {{in a number of}} natural riverine and estuarine environments to evaluate the quality of the velocity profile over the depth, minimum averaging time interval requirements and AV mission planning considerations. An appropriate <b>averaging</b> <b>window,</b> T*, was determined using the Kalman Algorithm with a Kalman gain equal to 1 %. T* was found to be independent of depth, flow velocity, and environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the channel estimation techniques for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems such as in IEEE 802. 11. Although {{there has been a}} great amount of research in this area, characterization of typical wireless indoor environments and design of channel estimation schemes that are both robust and practical for such channel conditions have not been thoroughly investigated. It is well known that the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) estimator provides the best mean-square-error (MSE) performance given a priori knowledge of channel statistics and operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the channel statistics are usually unknown and the MMSE estimator has too much computational complexity to be realized in practical systems. In this work, we propose two simple channel estimation techniques: one that is based on modifying the channel correlation matrix from the MMSE estimator and the other one with <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> based on the LS estimates. We also study the characteristics of several realistic indoor channel models that are of potential use for wireless local area networks (LANs). The first method, namely MMSE-exponential-Rhh, does not depend heavily on the channel statistics and yet offer performance improvement compared to that of the LS estimator. The simulation results also show that the second method, namely <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> (AW) estimator, provides the best performance at moderate SNR range...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Unigenic {{evolution}} {{is a powerful}} genetic strategy involving random mutagenesis of a single gene product to delineate functionally important domains of a protein. This method involves selection of variants of the protein which retain function, followed by statistical analysis comparing expected and observed mutation frequencies of each residue. Resultant mutability indices for each residue are averaged across a specified window of codons to identify hypomutable regions of the protein. As originally described, the effect of changes {{to the length of}} this <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> was not fully eludicated. In addition, it was unclear when sufficient functional variants had been examined to conclude that residues conserved in all variants have important functional roles. Results We demonstrate that the length of <b>averaging</b> <b>window</b> dramatically affects identification of individual hypomutable regions and delineation of region boundaries. Accordingly, we devised a region-independent chi-square analysis that eliminates loss of information incurred during window averaging and removes the arbitrary assignment of window length. We also present a method to estimate the probability that conserved residues have not been mutated simply by chance. In addition, we describe an improved estimation of the expected mutation frequency. Conclusion Overall, these methods significantly extend the analysis of unigenic evolution data over existing methods to allow comprehensive, unbiased identification of domains and possibly even individual residues that are essential for protein function. </p...|$|E
