Design of control charts requires that the engineer selects a sample size, a sampling frequency and the control limits for the chart. In this paper, a possible combination of design parameters is considered as a decision making unit which is identified by three attributes: hourly expected cost, detection power of the chart and in-control average run length. Optimal design of control charts can be formulated as multiple objective decision making (MODM). The cost function is extended from single to multiple <b>assignable</b> <b>causes</b> because there exist multiple <b>assignable</b> <b>causes</b> in real practice.

Nearly the whole population encamps {{on the bank of}} the river, and the people are employed in drawing out the salt in bullock-waggons. This salt is crystallised in great cubes, and is remarkably pure: Mr. Trenham Reeks has kindly analysed some for me, and he finds in it only 0.26 of gypsum and 0.22 of earthy matter. It is a singular fact that it does not serve so well for preserving meat as sea-salt from the Cape de Verd islands; and a merchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per cent less valuable. Hence the Cape de Verd salt is constantly imported, and is mixed with that from these salinas. The purity of the Patagonian salt, or absence from it of those other saline bodies found in all sea-water, is the only <b>assignable</b> <b>cause</b> for this inferiority: a conclusion which no one, I think, would have suspected, but which is supported by the fact lately ascertained, that those salts answer best for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent chlorides.

60|$|Among the {{possible}} effects of practical {{adherence to a}} theory, that aims to identify the style of prose and verse,--(if it does not indeed claim for the latter a yet nearer resemblance to the average style {{of men in the}} viva voce intercourse of real life)--we might anticipate the following as not the least likely to occur. It will happen, as I have indeed before observed, that the metre itself, the sole acknowledged difference, will occasionally become metre to the eye only. The existence of prosaisms, and that they detract from the merit of a poem, must at length be conceded, when a number of successive lines can be rendered, even to the most delicate ear, unrecognizable as verse, or as having even been intended for verse, by simply transcribing them as prose; when if the poem be in blank verse, this can be effected without any alteration, or at most by merely restoring one or two words to their proper places, from which they have been transplanted [69] for no <b>assignable</b> <b>cause</b> or reason but that of the author's convenience; but if it be in rhyme, by the mere exchange of the final word of each line for some other of the same meaning, equally appropriate, dignified and euphonic.|$|E

Some females, according to another experienced observer, Riedel,[170] are of a profligate disposition, and prefer almost any stranger to their own mate. Some amorous males, called by our English fanciers “gay birds,” are so successful in their gallantries, that, as Mr. H. Weir informs me, they must be shut up, {{on account of the}} mischief which they cause.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Control chart {{patterns}} (CCPs) {{recognition is}} an important issue in statistical process control, since abnormal CCPs exhibited in control charts can be associated with certain <b>assignable</b> <b>causes</b> and then help to quickly eliminate <b>assignable</b> <b>causes</b> of process variation. Most of the existing studies assume that the observed process data needs to be recognized are basic types of abnormal CCPs. However, in practical situations, the observed process data may be concurrent CCPs which are mixed together by two basic CCPs. In this study, an integrated scheme using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for recognizing concurrent CCPs. The proposed ICA-SVM scheme initially uses ICA with concurrent patterns for generating independent components (ICs). The hidden basic patterns of the concurrent patterns can be discovered in these ICs. The ICs are then used as input variables for the SVM for building a CCP recognition model. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ICA-SVM scheme can produce accurate and stable recognition results. It outperforms the three comparison models and is able to effectively recognize concurrent control chart patterns...|$|R

Then, a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimator. In addition, the proposed estimator is compared with the MLE of the process fraction nonconforming, derived under a single step change. The results show that the proposed estimator outperforms the MLE designed for step change, when a linear trend disturbance is present in the process...|$|R

Some salt from the salina Chiquitos, in the Pampean formation, is equally pure. It is a singular fact, that the salt from these salinas does not serve so well for preserving meat, as sea-salt from the Cape de Verde Islands; and a merchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as 50 per cent less valuable.

Restless men who will not follow any steady occupation—and this relic of barbarism is a great check to civilisation[236]—emigrate to newly-settled countries, where they prove useful pioneers.

In the breeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those individuals, though few in number, which are in any marked manner inferior, is by no means an unimportant element towards success.

6000|$|With birds it is {{difficult}} to decide by what standard we ought to judge of the earliness or lateness of the period of variation, whether by the age in reference to the duration of life, or to the power of reproduction, or to the number of moults through which the species passes. The moulting of birds, even within the same family, sometimes differs much without any <b>assignable</b> <b>cause.</b> Some birds moult so early, that nearly all the body-feathers are cast off before the first wing-feathers are fully grown; and we cannot believe that this was the primordial state of things. When the period of moulting has been accelerated, the age at which the colours of the adult plumage were first developed would falsely appear to us to have been earlier than it really was. This may be illustrated by the practice followed by some bird-fanciers, who pull out a few feathers from the breast of nestling bullfinches, and from the head or neck of young gold-pheasants, in order to ascertain their sex; for in the males these feathers are immediately replaced by coloured ones.[264] The actual duration of life is known in but few birds, so that we can hardly judge by this standard. And with reference to the period at which the powers of reproduction are gained, it is a remarkable fact that various birds occasionally breed whilst retaining their immature plumage.[265] ...|$|E

60|$|We see {{in these}} three sections, and in several others not given, that the old {{pavements}} have sunk or sagged considerably. Mr. Joyce formerly attributed this sinking solely to the slow settling of the ground. That {{there has been some}} settling is highly probable, and it may be seen in Fig. 15 that the pavement for a width of 5 feet over the southern enlargement of the room, which must have been built on fresh ground, has sunk a little more than on the old northern side. But this sinking may possibly have had no connection with the enlargement of the room; for in Fig. 13 one half of the pavement has subsided more than the other half without any <b>assignable</b> <b>cause.</b> In a bricked passage to Mr. Joyce's own house, laid down only about six years ago, the same kind of sinking has occurred as in the ancient buildings. Nevertheless it does not appear probable that the whole amount of sinking can be thus accounted for. The Roman builders excavated the ground to an unusual depth for the foundations of their walls, which were thick and solid; it is therefore hardly credible that they should have been careless about the solidity of the bed on which their tesselated and often ornamented pavements were laid. The sinking must, as it appears to me, be attributed in chief part to the pavement having been undermined by worms, which we know are still at work. Even Mr. Joyce at last admitted that this could not have failed to have produced a considerable effect. Thus also the large quantity of fine mould overlying the pavements can be accounted for, the presence of which would otherwise be inexplicable. My sons noticed that in one room in which the pavement had sagged very little, there was an unusually small amount of overlying mould.|$|E
