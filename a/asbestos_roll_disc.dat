40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Rolling</b> <b>disc</b> cutters are the {{business}} end of hard rock and mixed face tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Since their first successful employment on a TBM over fifty years ago, disc cutter technology has constantly evolved, allowing modern TBMs to excavate very hard and abrasive rock efficiently. Disc cutters have also been employed successfully on earth pressure balance (EPB) and slurry machines, cutting rock under water and ground pressure. The range of materials excavated by machines today is broader, excavation rates higher and cutter costs lower than ever before, proving the value of investment in cutter development. This paper describes recent improvements in disc cutter components including cutter ring materials and processing, as well as improvements in lubricants, bearings, seals and cutter condition monitoring. These developments have resulted in more reliable cutters capable of operating {{in a wide range of}} geological condi-tions. Ultimately these improvements result in a better value for both contractors and project owners...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure, the influence of work <b>roll</b> test <b>disc</b> surface roughness on both the surface wear of and the interaction between wear and rolling contact fatigue at the surface of back-up <b>roll</b> test <b>discs</b> has been quantified using the results obtained from experimental simulations carried out on a rolling–sliding testing machine.

40|$|Many scholars, media reformists, {{activists and}} musicians {{currently}} lament the present condition of commercial radio, given the deregulatory {{effects of the}} last two decades on radio ownership and content. Many contend that commercial radio, once thought of as a deliberative tool in advancing the democratic ideals of inclusiveness and representation, is now nothing more than a commercialized wasteland with the democratic ideals of it serving as a deliberative tool laid to rest due, in part, to radio ownership consolidation, competition from other media sources, and the provision of overlapping and homogenized content on the nation’s radio airwaves. While there has been considerable scholarship exploring the need to breathe deliberative life back into the localism standard by requiring broadcasters to include more meaningful local news and public affairs programming, pursuant to the public interest obligations imposed on radio licensees, little scholarly attention has been given to broadening understandings of localism to include music and popular cultural expression for the purpose of furthering dialogic discourse in particular, rather than solely for entertainment purposes. This article focuses on a particular moment in radio and America’s cultural history that was rife with struggles over constructions of identity, and with contests over meaning between dominant ideological frameworks and voices of subversion that would challenge these dominant normative understandings, all within a very commercialized, corporately controlled media environment. Specifically, this article focuses on the rise of rock and roll on commercial radio and of the White rock and <b>roll</b> <b>disc</b> jockey, who came to represent the pulse of the historically marginalized (pre World War II), White American youth. The White rock and <b>roll</b> <b>disc</b> jockey, through radio, heavily influenced American popular culture and this newly emerging and recognized audience, and was instrumental in forging discussion and deliberation in America, at a time of intense inter-generational unrest among younger and older generations of White Americans. By exploring this snapshot in history of radio’s subaltern past via the playing of rock and roll by White radio disc jockeys on White radio during what some have defined as America’s Cultural Revolution, this article builds on the scholarship of others that have considered radio’s influence on popular culture, dialogic democracy, and the struggles over will formation and constructions of identity. This article expands upon such analysis, however, by exploring the law’s role in this contest over meaning and the dialogic process: a role that {{must be taken into account}} as the FCC, Congress, and the courts reconsider current media policy in light of the public outcry over the lack of diverse content on the nation’s radio airwaves. It also is the first to specifically call for the inclusion of music and, by extension, popular cultural expression into the localism concept for dialogic purposes to ensure that these sites that are key to will formation and the deliberative process are not overlooked or, better yet, extinguished due to consolidation in radio ownership and the current market driven interpretive standard applied to the public interest standard. As America residentially re-segregates itself, and becomes all the more socio-economically stratified based on class, history has shown that the rumblings and contestations of the overlooked and marginalized may be found in their everyday interactions and interests, and musical preferences, which can serve as challenges to dominant and hegemonic societal configurations...|$|R

500|$|Among the {{distinguishing}} features of Andriamanelo's reign was {{the expansion of}} his territory around the sacred hill of Alasora through a military campaign against the Vazimba to push these legendary, primitive first settlers of Madagascar toward {{the west of the}} island. After Andriamanelo had successfully expanded his kingdom to include Alasora to the south and Merimanjaka to the north, the continued presence of a Vazimba stronghold at Analamanga (located between the two halves of his realm and effectively separating them) posed too great a threat to the unity of his kingdom to allow the situation to stand. He resolved to capture Analamanga and drive the Vazimba from his territory, an ambition partially realized during his reign. Popular legend attributes Andriamanelo's military successes to several innovations, including the discovery of iron smelting and propagation of the iron-tipped spear [...] against the Vazimba who fought with weapons of clay. He also fortified his capital at Alasora by creating hadivory (dry moats), hadifetsy (defensive trenches) and vavahady (town gates protected by a large <b>rolled</b> stone <b>disc</b> acting as a barrier), thereby rendering the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks. However, his attempt to establish Merina dominance in the central Highlands was thwarted when he proved unable to seize Analamanga; this Vazimba stronghold would not fall until at last conquered by Andriamanelo's grandson, Andrianjaka.|$|R
