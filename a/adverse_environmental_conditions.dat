Plants cope with this <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> by coordinating the up- or downregulation of an array of stress responsive genes. Reprogramming the expression of these genes leads to rebalanced development and growth that are in concert with the reduced water availability and that ultimately confer enhanced stress tolerance. Currently, several techniques have been employed to monitor genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming under drought stress. The results from these high throughput studies indicate that drought stress-induced transcriptional reprogramming is dynamic, has temporal and spatial specificity, and is coupled with the circadian clock and phytohormone signaling pathways. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Plants respond and adapt to drought stresses by triggering various signalling pathways leading to physiological, metabolic and developmental changes that may ultimately contribute to enhanced tolerance to the stress. Here, a novel non-coding RNA (ncRNA) involved in plant drought stress tolerance was identified. We showed that increasing the expression of this ncRNA led to enhanced sensitivity during seed germination and seedling growth to the phytohormone abscisic acid. The mutant seedlings are also more sensitive to osmotic stress inhibition of lateral root growth. Consistently, seedlings with enhanced expression of this ncRNA exhibited reduced transiprational water loss and were more drought-tolerant than the wild type. Future analyses of the mechanism for its role in drought tolerance may help us to understand how plant drought tolerance could be further regulated by this novel ncRNA...|$|R

In his absence, Air Commodore Harry Cobby took command of No.10 OG; {{two months later}} the formation was redesignated the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF). Still recuperating, Scherger acted {{in the role of}} Air Member for Personnel at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, from January to May 1945. On 10May, he was posted back to the Pacific to resume control of No.1 TAF following Cobby's dismissal {{in the wake of the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny".

In addition, automatic phoneme recognition experiments are conducted to examine the possibility of recognizing speech only from articulation, that is, without any audio information. The results obtained are promising, which confirm that phonetic features characterizing articulation are as discriminating as those characterizing acoustics (except for voicing).

40|$|Drought {{stress is}} a common <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> that seriously affects crop {{productivity}} worldwide. Due {{to the complexity of}} drought as a stress signal, deciphering drought tolerance mechanisms has remained a major challenge to plant biologists. To develop new approaches to study plant drought tolerance, we searched for phenotypes conferred by drought stress and identified the inhibition of lateral root development by drought stress as an adaptive response to the stress. This drought response is partly mediated by the phytohormone abscisic acid. Genetic screens using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were devised, and drought inhibition of lateral root growth (dig) mutants with altered responses to drought or abscisic acid in lateral root development were isolated. Characterization of these dig mutants revealed that they also exhibit altered drought stress tolerance, indicating that this root response to drought stress is intimately linked to drought adaptation of the entire plant and {{can be used as a}} trait to access the elusive drought tolerance machinery. Our study also revealed that multiple mechanisms coexist and together contribute to whole-plant drought tolerance...|$|R

Currently some companies in the industry that design with polymer-carbon fiber composites use a "knock down " factor on mechanical properties to account for the effect of environment or elevated temperatures. For example, the failure strength of a composite is reduced by some arbitrary factor such as ten percent for the <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> that the system will encounter. If the composite must operate at elevated temperatures, then the design failure strength will reflect this condition with some arbitrary reduction.

Physiological experiments to study root-shoot communication associated with gene expression studies in roots and leaves were performed. V/ 4 xRL was much more tolerant to water deficit than V/ 2 xRL. Gene expression analysis in leaves and roots showed that more genes related to the response to water stress were differentially expressed in V/ 2 xRL than in V/ 4 xRL. Prior to the stress, when comparing V/ 4 xRL to V/ 2 xRL, V/ 4 xRL leaves had lower stomatal conductance and greater abscisic acid (ABA) content. In roots,ABA content was higher in V/ 4 xRL and was associated to a greater expression of drought responsive genes, including CsNCED 1, a pivotal regulatory gene of ABA biosynthesis. We conclude that tetraploidy modifies the expression of genes in Rangpur lime citrus roots to regulate long-distance ABA signalling and adaptation to stress. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} {{relatively}} more number of inoculated Rhizobium performed better in NN than the background rhizobia in the Haramaya site {{than in the}} other study sites. This indicates the presence of less competitive background rhizobia in infectiveness at Haramaya site than the other study sites. The current study showed that those isolates that performed better in improving NN did not perform similarly in NDW enhancement in all study sites, suggesting that better in infectiveness is not always good in effectiveness. The present work indicated that all isolates including the uninoculated control produced the lowest mean NN and NDW in all genotypes at Babile. This was probably due to low rhizobial population in this site (Ojo et al. 2015) and this consequently reduced the nodule formation.

The quality of information derived from these optical images was evaluated regarding field altimetric measurements. Precise topographic field information acquired from Global Positioning System (GPS) was used as Ground Control Points (GCPs) for the modeling of the stereoscopic Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and as Independent Check Points (ICPs) for the calculation of elevation accuracies.

40|$|AbstractThe {{survival}} of land snails in an <b>adverse</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition</b> {{depends on the}} integral physiological, morphological and behavioural adaptations. These adaptations are essential in understanding the species-specific habitat requirements and in predicting their environmental responses. In this study, the monthly and the periodic patterns of eco-physiological adaptation of land snail, Achatina achatina in Nsukka tropical agro-ecosystem were assessed from December 2012 to July 2013. Standard methods were employed in sampling the land snail and determination of the water content, biochemical fuel reserves and enzyme concentrations of the samples. The present results showed that lipids were high {{at the beginning of}} aestivation and depleted as the aestivation progressed. Glycogen was significantly low throughout the aestivation months (December–March) and increased in the active months (April–July). Protein content recorded a definite pattern all through the months studied. Catabolism of lactate and a decrease in activity of LDH during aestivation and substantial increase upon activation were observed. Data showed that transaminase and aspartate enzymes depleted during the aestivation months indicating that the snails may have developed potential cell injury due to oxidative stress and thermal heat. A disassociation between the physiological responses and climatic data was recorded. The physiological adaptation of A. achatina ensures regular adjustment under extreme conditions and compensates for its metabolic regulation in the tropics. It is concluded that {{survival of}} A. achatina is not environmentally predicted; rather it depends on the species-specific inherent process in predicting responses for survival...|$|R
