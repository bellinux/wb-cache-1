5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> when {{he became}} the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and his running mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W.

Jackson was still considered a likely appointee for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.|$|E
5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters.

5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009.
