5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers <b>and</b> <b>Fathers</b> Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{present study}} investigates the {{attitude}} of adolescents to authority. Thirty-eight adolescents from Boys' Town, Tongaat, participated in this study. The intention {{of the study was}} to investigate {{the attitude of}} the boys to authority and to determine whether there was a difference in attitude to authority according to grade, race, parental academic background or type of family structure that the boys had. Generally the adolescents at Boys' Town, Tongaat, viewed the mother as authoritarian <b>and</b> the <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible. Boys in grade 6 - 9 viewed both mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible while boys in grade 10 - 12 viewed both mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as permissive. The Indian and black adolescents viewed mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as authoritative/flexible while the white and coloured adolescents viewed mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> as permissive. When parents had grade 12 or less qualification both mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were viewed as permissive. When parents had a post-matric qualification, both mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> were viewed as authoritative/ flexible. Adolescents from single-family households found mother to be authoritative/flexible <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritarian. Adolescents from nuclear-family households found mother to be equally permissive <b>and</b> authoritative/flexible <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be permissive. Adolescents from extended-family households found mother to be permissive <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritative/flexible. Adolescents from foster families found both mother <b>and</b> <b>father</b> to be authoritative/flexible. The positive changes that were brought about in the adolescents and in their relationship with their environment during their stay at Boys' Town, Tongaat, leads to the recommendation that the behaviour modification programme and the parenting skills workshop adopted by Boys' Town, be examined and assessed with the possible consideration for implementation at South African Schools and homes...|$|R

5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French {{troops would be}} soon returned by the Germans. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E

25|$|Family {{breakdown}} as {{a result}} of divorce, desertion, death, illness, domestic violence, drunkenness or the trauma of war led to children being taken into care or being placed in care by their own families. Few women who had been widowed, deserted or divorced could afford to raise children. Work opportunities were fewer for women than men, and women were paid less than the male wage for the same work. Lone mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers</b> found it difficult to work to support children as there was little affordable childcare available.|$|E

25|$|Others contest these conclusions, {{stating that}} family courts are biased {{in favor of}} fathers and that the lower {{percentage}} of separated fathers as custodial parents {{is a result of}} choices made by fathers rather than bias of family courts. According to sociologist Michael Flood, father's rights activists have exaggerated the disparity in custody awards between mothers <b>and</b> <b>fathers,</b> and ignored {{the fact that in the}} vast majority of cases, fathers voluntarily relinquish custody of their children through private arrangements; either because they are willing to do so, or because they do not expect a favorable court ruling.|$|E
