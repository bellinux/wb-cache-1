As an emergency control <b>action,</b> <b>load</b> shedding (LS) can effectively protect the power system against frequency instability. In practice, its strategies include event-driven load shedding (ELS) and under-frequency load shedding (UFLS). This paper conducts comprehensive review and comparison for the two LS strategies. Discussions are also given on their coordination for more cost-effective frequency instability prevention. Simulation examples are provided to lead the study. Based on this work, a clear picture of the two LS strategies can be shown and deeper insight can be gained for better design and application of the LS strategies in practice...|$|E

We argue that normal state constraints that refer to only the truth values of fluents are not strong enough for this purpose, and that a notion of causation needs to be employed explicitly. Technically, we introduce a new ternary predicate Caused into the situation calculus: Caused(p,v,s) if the proposition p is caused (by something unspecified) to have the truth value v in the state s. Using this predicate, we can represent not only action-triggered causal statements such as that the <b>action</b> <b>load</b> causes the gun to be loaded, but also fluent-triggered ones such as {{that the fact that}} the switch is in the up position causes the lamp to be on.

40|$|Load {{transfer}} {{is the ability}} of a joint or crack in a concrete pavement to transfer load from one slab to the next through shear <b>action.</b> <b>Load</b> Transfer Restoration (LTR) is a rehabilitation technique for increasing the load transfer capa-bility of existing PCC pavement by placement of dowel bars or other mechanical devices across joints or cracks that exhibit poor load transfer. Dowel bar retrofit (load transfer restoration) is most often used as part of a comprehensive Concrete Pavement Preservation (CPP) program. The techniques employed in a CPP program usu-ally include a combination of full-depth repair, partial-depth repair, dowel bar retrofit, joint and crack resealing, slab stabilization, cross-stitching of longitudinal cracks, grooving and diamond grinding. If the application of each technique oc-curs at the right time, the maximum use and life of the pavement will be achieved. Recently, some agencies have performed experi-mental projects to try out other methods of re-moving concrete for dowel bar retrofit.

The current study assesses {{the extent to which}} performance on the FP I and FP II subtests can be predicted by memory, visual ability, verbal ability, and executive functioning, in 454 outpatients from a neuropsychology clinic. Data from the Family Pictures I (FPI) and Family Pictures II (FPII) subtests, in addition to scores obtained from commonly used measures of memory, verbal, visual, and executive functioning were analyzed via hierarchical multiple regression analyses, co-varying for age and education.

Furthermore, the factor analyses revealed that all three components of location, action, and character load on a mixed general visual ability and general memory factor.

40|$|An {{effective}} reliability-based {{procedure is}} presented to assess the capability of hospitals to be functional after a seismic event of a given intensity. Every major function in a hospital depends on the joint action of various cooperating services, which in turn are made up from {{a certain number of}} sub-services. Such a complex organization is described in terms of a logical scheme and subsequently reduced to a minimal cut-set representation. Fur each sub-service a collapse criterion is defined, by which the strength is compared to the <b>action</b> <b>load,</b> both represented as random variables. Strengths are evaluated through assessment analyses based on design drawings. Loads are evaluated from 3 -D linear dynamic analyses under seismic input. This is given by the Eurocode 8 elastic response spectrum, scaled at a given peak ground acceleration and account for the position of the sub-service within the building. By calculating the failure probability of each service by FORM (First Order Reliability Method) or SORM (Second Order Reliability Methods), the probability of functional interruption is obtained in terms of Ditlevsen bounds, conditional on a given earthquake intensity. The method helps to single out weak elements and potential sources of damage (structural, non-structural, equipment) within the hospital. This allows: (a) to investigate quantitatively the effectiveness of different upgrading criteria, (b) to select rationally intervention hypotheses, both in the retrofitting and rehabilitation of existing hospitals and in the design optimization of new ones, and (c) to evaluate different investment options for seismic vulnerability mitigation. As an example, an application to a case study hospital is presented. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Lt...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has focused on}} load-sharing and system effects in repetitive-member wood floor systems subject to transverse loading. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to investigate load-sharing and system effects in repetitive-member wall systems which may be subject to combined transverse and gravity (vertical) loading, and which may have different boundary conditions from floors. This research investigates load-sharing and system effects in light-frame wood wall systems and seeks to develop repetitive-member system factors for codified design that rationally account for load sharing and other system effects. These factors are intended for use in the design of individual wall members, much as repetitive-member factors are used in the design of parallel-member floor and roof systems. As part of this research, an analytical model was developed to account for partial composite action, two-way action, and openings in the wall system. The model was validated using experimental test results and was shown to be able to predict reasonably well the response of light-frame wall systems. The model was then incorporated into a Monte Carlo simulation to perform reliability analyses of light-frame wall systems. Since the structural model is complex, and including a time-history analysis within the time-dependent simulation was not computationally practical, the load combination issue was considered separately from the reliability analysis. Sensitivity studies were conducted to investigate how different system parameters affect strength and reliability of light-frame wall systems. The reliability of light-frame wall systems was next evaluated using a portfolio of representative light-frame wall systems designed according to current code provisions. This portfolio approach was also used in evaluating system factors for light-frame wall systems. Thus, two different approaches (a reliability-based approach and a strength-ratio approach) were considered for developing system factors for member-design to account for load sharing, partial composite action and other system effects. Using the strength-ratio approach, a new framework for system factors (i. e., partial system factors) is suggested in which the effects of partial composite <b>action,</b> <b>load</b> sharing, load redistribution and system size (number of members) are treated separately...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of structural materials and sensor technology has impacted the bridge industry by improving the robustness {{of the highway}} network and providing behavior based condition assessments. During the last decades, conventional materials have been supplemented with state-of-the-art materials (e. g., carbon and fiber based, ultra-high performance concrete, etc.). The {{evolution of}} smart or intelligent structures by incorporating systems to quantify performance will continue to revolutionize the bridge industry. While laboratory and field applications have indicated that smart materials are appropriate for bridge applications, additional investigations regarding sensor installation, deployment and data reduction are still needed. The work described herein {{is a collection of}} field and laboratory tests in which sensors were applied to verify structural and material behavior and develop smart members for integration as part of a structural health monitoring system for bridge superstructures. Three projects are presented in which new materials and unique structures were evaluated using specialized sensors and monitoring techniques. Two basket-handle arch pedestrian bridges with high-strength steel hanger rods supporting a pre-cast, post-tensioned concrete panel deck system were monitored to prevent deck cracks {{in the vicinity of the}} hanger rods. Fiber optic sensors and externally mounted accelerometers were attached to the hanger rods to indirectly determine the tensile forces during incremental construction stages and in service conditions. For the second project, a three-span prestressed concrete (PC) girder, composite deck bridge was monitored and evaluated. One end span consisted of composite FRP deck panels and was compared to the opposite cast-in-place reinforced concrete deck end span. Strategically placed transducers measured strain levels on the PC girders and the FRR panels from controlled live and ambient traffic loadings to determine the degree of composite <b>action,</b> <b>load</b> distribution, and maximum in-service strains. A FRP panel temporary bypass bridge was evaluated as a replacement to typical steel temporary bridges as part of the third project. The research focused on the design, fabrication, construction and load testing of this state-of-the-art bridge. This bridge was instrumented with transducers for measuring deflections and loaded with a static truck at pertinent locations to evaluate its performance. A five year research plan was established to develop a conceptual smart timber bridge made of glued laminated (glulam) stringers and a transverse glulam deck. Both stock and custom fiber optic sensor packages were implemented to quantify the structural response. The first of multiple phases of this national five year plan includes the development of an efficient structural health monitoring system and a smart timber bridge field demonstration. To support these goals, two types of FBG sensors packages were developed, the first evaluated the structural strain response and the second isolated the sensor from mechanical strain for detecting deterioration parameters (e. g., moisture content, corrosion, wood deterioration, etc.). Techniques were developed for embedding and attaching the FBG sensor packages to glulam specimens. Small scale specimens were instrumented with the custom FBG sensor packages and tested under a range of temperature and loading conditions to determine sensor viability. A full scale glulam beam was instrumented with similar FBG sensor packages to demonstrate applicability and evaluate performance at service level proportions. From this work, the following contributions in structural bridge monitoring were added to the state-of-the-art: *	Application of FBG sensors and accelerometers to monitor the structural behavior of a bridge during construction. *	Applied testing of non-traditional FRP deck panels to validate composite action. *	Initial development of a smart timber bridge structural health monitoring system. *	Development of FBG sensor packages for implementation in glulam members as part of a smart timber bridge...|$|E
