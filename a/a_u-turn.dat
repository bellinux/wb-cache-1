5|$|During {{the evening}} of the 10 February 1942 the German {{flotilla}} prepared to undertake their operation. As they slipped anchor RAF bombers appeared over head. The German ships conducted <b>a</b> <b>u-turn</b> and sped back to the dock. The RAF bombers released their bombs but did little damage. Fortunately they did not notice anything untoward.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} <b>a</b> <b>u-turn</b> {{out of the}} station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>u-turn.</b> After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E
5|$|The route then passes {{south of}} a golf course and enters Port Kent, where it intersects with more local streets, most of which serve homes and businesses. The highway turns northward soon afterward, crosses a pair of train tracks {{maintained}} by Canadian Pacific Railway and the Port Kent Amtrak station, makes <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> and {{comes to an end}} at the Burlington–Port Kent Ferry landing.|$|E
50|$|Season 14 {{introduced}} a new twist to the U-Turn: the U-Turn in Leg 4 was <b>a</b> Blind <b>U-Turn,</b> in which the team electing to use it did so anonymously; other U-Turns (and the Yields that were replaced) required teams utilizing them to acknowledge their use to subsequent teams. The U-Turn in Leg 11 was <b>a</b> normal <b>U-Turn.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Starting {{in season}} 14, teams {{were met with}} a new {{variation}} of the <b>U-Turn</b> called <b>a</b> [...] "Blind U-Turn." [...] If teams use <b>a</b> Blind <b>U-Turn,</b> {{they do not have}} to publicly reveal themselves as the perpetrators with their [...] "Courtesy of" [...] photo. It was also featured in season two of the Australian version with the name [...] "Anonymous U-Turn". From season 17, a [...] "Double U-Turn" [...] was introduced, in which two teams can each choose <b>a</b> team to <b>U-Turn.</b> Teams can only <b>U-Turn</b> once, and <b>a</b> team cannot be U-Turned twice in the same leg. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>U-Turned</b> team can U-Turn another team, and this can be done before they complete their extra Detour branch. However, it is possible for another team to strategically <b>U-Turn</b> <b>a</b> team that they are aware has already passed the U-Turn, thus nullifying the opportunity for another team that has already been U-Turned to use it. Season 18 introduced an [...] "automatic U-Turn", where the team who came in last in the starting line task would have to do both tasks of the first Detour (which was not incurred until Leg 2). An automatic U-Turn was also used as the [...] "Handicap" [...] penalty for Leg 10 in the Norwegian edition of the show and [...] From season 19 to season 22, the U-Turn sign was remade to use computer touchscreens, removing the need for teams to carry their [...] "Courtesy of" [...] photo, though teams could still only U-Turn another team once per race. When choosing the teams, the users are aware which teams are still in the race, but are not told what teams, if any, have passed the U-Turn sign. In season 21, <b>a</b> Blind Double <b>U-Turn</b> was included. It incorporates the rules of <b>a</b> Blind <b>U-Turn</b> and <b>a</b> Double <b>U-Turn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There was <b>a</b> U-turn/Double <b>U-turn</b> on this leg. However, it was unused and unaired.|$|R
5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} the abduction of his stepdaughter from {{within sight of}} their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat when he did <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water. The boat's propellor then struck the man, who died due to severe cuts and blood loss.|$|E
5|$|MD 300 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 213 (Church Hill Road) {{in the northern}} part of the town of Church Hill. The highway heads east as two-lane Sudlersville Road and intersects MD 19 (Main Street) before leaving the town. The state highway heads northeast and intersects US 301 (Blue Star Memorial Highway) at a superstreet intersection next to a park and ride lot in the southwest quadrant. Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn right onto US 301, perform <b>a</b> <b>U-turn,</b> then turn right again to continue on MD 300. The highway curves east at Dudley Corners, where the route crosses Red Lion Branch and meets the southern end of MD 290 (Dudley Corner Road) and the north end of Benton Corners Road, which leads to the historic Dudley's Chapel.|$|E

5000|$|The clue {{after the}} Detour {{instructed}} teams {{to go to}} Sadarghat for <b>a</b> new <b>U-Turn</b> twist, which was <b>a</b> Double <b>U-Turn.</b> Then they traveled by cycle rickshaw to Nazira Bazaar for the Roadblock, asking [...] "Who's got it all together?" [...] One team member had to properly assemble a cycle rickshaw using the parts provided {{in order to receive}} their clue. This clue directed the teams to the Pit Stop at historic Lalbagh Fort.|$|R
5|$|Beyond this interchange, {{the route}} comes to two-way toll plaza and has <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> ramp from the {{southbound}} direction to the northbound direction {{intended to provide}} southbound motorists access to MD 695A. This ramp, known as MD 695C, also provides access to northbound I-695 from MD 695A by way of Authority Drive. After this, the route ascends onto the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which carries I-695 over the lower Baltimore Harbor and Patapsco River. Unlike the Fort McHenry or Harbor Tunnels, HAZMAT trucks are allowed to cross the Key Bridge. After crossing the Patapsco River over the bridge the route touches down within the Baltimore city limits and continues west past Thoms Cove through Hawkins Point's industrial areas. It comes to an interchange with Quarantine Road, which provides access to MD 173, south of Curtis Bay. By this point, the route’s signage changes from northsouth to eastwest. Past this interchange, the Baltimore Beltway continues west {{and returns to the}} Curtis Creek drawbridges.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{begins at}} {{a pair of}} {{junctions}} with MD 355 (Wisconsin Avenue) and MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road) {{on either side of}} Bethesda Station on the Washington Metro's Red Line in downtown Bethesda. Westbound MD 410 ends at the intersection of two-way MD 355 and the southern terminus of MD 187, which begins one-way northbound along Old Georgetown Road. Traffic from the southbound direction of MD 187 follows Woodmont Avenue and Montgomery Lane to the start of eastbound MD 410 at the intersection of MD 355 and Montgomery Avenue. MD 410 heads east as a one-way pairEastWest Highway westbound and Montgomery Avenue eastboundto the eastern edge of downtown Bethesda, where the two directions converge east of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. From that intersection, which includes <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> ramp from Montgomery Avenue to westbound EastWest Highway, the state highway continues east as four-lane undivided EastWest Highway and crosses over the Capital Crescent Trail.|$|E
5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. Traffic that wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, traffic that needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform <b>a</b> <b>U-turn.</b> Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Route 202 and County Route 511 Alternate {{cross the}} Pompton River into Wayne, Passaic County, {{where the road}} becomes Mountainview Boulevard. It crosses the Montclair-Boonton Line near the Mountain View Station and comes to an {{interchange}} with Route 23, where County Route 511 Alternate ends and U.S. Route 202 heads north on Route 23, a six-lane freeway that is state maintained. The road interchanges with County Route 670 (Alps Road) and then with County Route 683 (Newark-Pompton Turnpike). Route 23 and U.S. Route 202 continue north from this point as a surface road through commercial areas. At <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> ramp, the eastbound direction of County Route 504 follows both directions of the road, having to use the ramp {{in order to continue}} across the road. Northbound U.S. Route 202 splits from Route 23, where the cut-off intersection with County Route 504 is located. At this point, the westbound direction of County Route 504 and the southbound direction of U.S. Route 202 follow southbound Route 23 until an intersection.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and outgoing lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing <b>a</b> <b>U-turn</b> from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E
