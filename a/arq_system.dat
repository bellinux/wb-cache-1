40|$|Wireless digital {{communication}} always suffers from errors introducted by the channel. Throughout the years, {{various types of}} forward error correcting schemes {{have been developed to}} soften this effect. However, the recently increasing demands of transmitting data very reliably, i. e. with almost neglectable bit error rate, also over time varying channels, called for other error control systems, which inform the transmitter of the correct or incorrect reception of data. These systems are called automatic repeat request schemes (ARQ) and are the main topic of this work. The contributions of this work to this area are threefold. Firstly, classifications of ARQ systems which can be found in literature are inconsistent and, even worse, the most popular ones are based on actual decoder realizations. This, however, represents a wrong concept, since a system classification should be based on system properties, such as what is sent for the n-th transmission, and not on how a specific realization makes use of it. Therefore, this work, first of all, distinguishes <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> from other feedback systems and proceeds with a classification scheme which is purely based on <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> properties. This classification is used throughout the remainder of this work. The second contribution lies in the area of ARQ performance measurements. From the realm of these measures, mainly one is treated in literature, namely the throughput. In addition {{to the fact that there}} are almost as much throughput definitions as there are ARQ papers, it is hardly treated analytically. The only exceptions are the inefficient memoryless ARQ schemes, which, due to their lack of memory, are much simpler to analyze. Therefore, this work introduces a definition for the throughput as a measurement for the information theoretical performance of ARQ systems, which is independent of the transmission protocol (Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, Selective-Repeat). As a consequence, the channel capacity serves as ultimate performance bound of this throughput. Besides the throughput, other important <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> properties such as maximum and average number of transmissions, various delays, and the data rate are introduced. All these measures are derived successively from another, including more and more system and environment parameters. All measurements are bounded with the help of the set of rejection probabilities. Using the results of this work and the set of rejection probabilities of a certain <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> and channel model, a detailed insight into the performance of the system can be obtained. Finally, the problem of how to combine independent transmissions of a codeword with possibly varying mapper is investigated. More specifically, optimal combining for maximum likelihood, as well as MAP decoding is investigated for a variety of wireless channel models...|$|E

Microfiche. xi, 191 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAutomatic-repeat-request (ARQ) {{systems have}} been the most popular means for error control in digital {{transmission}} systems. They provide a relatively simple and highly reliable means for eliminating transmission errors. However, the throughput of an <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> may deteriorate badly with increasing bit-error rates especially if there are significant transmission delays such as experienced in satellite or long terrestrial circuits. This dissertation first proposes a class of mixed-mode protocols which incorporate a selective-repeat mode of retransmission. This is combined with a secondary mode to prevent receiver buffer overflow. The throughput analysis for these schemes is presented and shows that they can significantly outperform the conventional Go-Back-N procedure for transmission over circuits with delay. The analysis also shows how throughput is related to the size of buffer provided at the receiver. It is also demonstrated that the choice of secondary retransmission mode does not {{have a significant effect on}} the throughput but has a bearing on complexity. Further improvement in performance may be achieved by use of a hybrid <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> incorporating forward-error correction as well as retransmission. The dissertation considers some parity-retransmission schemes in which blocks of parity bits are used for retransmissions rather than repetition of the original information block. This enables the system to adaptively incorporate error correction as well as detection when channel bit-error rates increase. An analysis procedure is presented which permits comparison of throughput efficiency for a variety of ARQ retransmission protocols and forward-error correction codes. Particular attention is focused on the use of half-rate convolutional codes for error correction. A trellis algorithm is shown to be useful for computation of the error correction capability of modestly powerful convolutional codes with sliding-block feedback decoding. An alternative approach using combinatorial procedures is also presented. New rate one-half codes are found which are related to optimum orthogonalizable rate one-third codes. These related code pairs can be used in parity-retransmission schemes to provide more powerful error correction when channel bit-error rates deteriorate badly. Finally the throughput and reliability performance of the hybrid schemes is outlined for various combinations of retransmission protocols and error-correction systems. Results are presented for convolutional codes and block codes and indicate the possible tradeoffs between complexity and performance. It is concluded that convolutional codes with relatively simple sliding-block decoding can ensure high throughput is maintained on a hybrid <b>ARQ</b> <b>system</b> despite significant bit-error rates and transmission delays...|$|E
