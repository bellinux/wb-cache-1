His communications with the ANC were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure.

Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E

The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E

5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The growing hardships in {{the country}} {{during the early years}} of World War I pushed Quwatli to join the secret society of al-Fatat, which was {{facilitated}} by his childhood friend and co-founder, Nasib al-Bakri.

In 1913, the society established its main branch in Damascus, and was successful in attracting the Syrian elite into its ranks.|$|E

Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E
5|$|Nasib al-Bakri (1888–1966) was a Syrian {{politician}} and nationalist {{leader in the}} first half of the 20th century. He played a major role in establishing al-Fatat, an underground organization which sought the independence <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories. As the chief envoy between al-Fatat and the Hejaz-based Hashemites, al-Bakri became a close aide to Emir Faisal when the latter became King of Syria following the success of the 1916 Arab Revolt. Al-Bakri opposed the establishment of the French Mandate of Syria and became one of the chief commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt, leading the rebels' brief capture of Damascus. He escaped a death warrant in Syria in 1927, but returned the following year after being amnestied.|$|E

5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from {{its ability to}} adapt to the {{conditions}} of the Nile River valley for agriculture. The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture. With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to defeat foreign enemies and assert Egyptian dominance. Motivating and organizing these activities was a bureaucracy of elite scribes, religious leaders, and administrators under the control of a pharaoh, who ensured the cooperation <b>and</b> <b>unity</b> of the Egyptian people {{in the context of an}} elaborate system of religious beliefs.|$|E
