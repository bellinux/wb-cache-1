5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

500|$|Flynn said [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent" [...] and [...] "Wolves" [...] {{were the}} most {{difficult}} songs to construct. For [...] "Clenching", he attributed the difficulty {{to the amount of}} tracks; the introduction of the song has 90, including multiple three-part harmony with two guitars, 20 tracks of snare drum, four tracks of kick drum, and military marching cymbals. The song continues with five electric guitars, three acoustic guitars and two bass guitars. Flynn also described the song [...] "Wolves" [...] as difficult because [...] "it's <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be super tight; there were so many riffs that had to be just locked on down picking". Mark Keaton provided audio engineering, and Colin Richardson mixed the record in London.|$|E

500|$|After the BNP's poor {{performance}} at the 1997 general election, opposition to Tyndall's leadership grew. His position was damaged {{by a lack of}} financial transparency in the party, with concerns being raised that large donations to the party had been used instead by Tyndall for personal expenses. The modernisers challenged his control of the party, resulting in its first ever leadership election, held in October 1999. Tyndall was challenged by Nick Griffin, who offered an improved administration, financial transparency, and greater support for local branches. 80% of party members voted, with two-thirds backing Griffin; Tyndall had secured only 411 votes, representing 30% of the total membership. Tyndall accepted his defeat with equanimity and stood down as chairman. He stated that he would become [...] "an ordinary member", telling his supporters that [...] "we have <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pull together in the greater cause of race and nation".|$|E
500|$|At the September 26 MSNBC debate, Biden {{explained}} {{how he would}} allow for Social security to last. He {{said that in the}} 1980s he had a meeting with prominent members of Congress and the solution they came up with was the raise the cap level, he stated that now the same solution would apply and that unity between the two parties was also necessary, [...] "It was Joe Biden, Pat Moynihan, Bob Dole... George Mitchell when we made that deal [...] I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> jump in this boat at the same time.' So the bottom line here is, you can't do it by growing the economy alone. So I would raise the cap." [...] Later in the debate Biden was one of three participants (along with Dodd and Richardson) who said they would ban smoking in public places.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{described}} his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, [...] "the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, {{and people are}} just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be just flowing, and continue to flow." [...] Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is [...] "appealingly atmospheric", but [...] "lacks definition", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game.|$|E

Its instrumentation includes 60's soul finger snaps, police sirens, hand claps and [...] "scratchy guitarlines". According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, the song was composed in the key of E minor with a tempo of 144 beats per minute. Mars' vocals range spans from the low note of G4 to the high note of B5. Jon Caramanica from The New York Times felt that Mars was trying to [...] "channel" [...] Little Richard and called the track [...] "jumpy" [...] and [...] "salacious". Lyrically, [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] conveys the message for women to avoid Mars since he is willing to break their hearts due to being a playboy and a [...] "rolling stone" [...] ("Lord knows I'm a rolling stone"). Moreover, there is a comparison established between Mars' penis and a carrot, [...] "So many eager young bunnies...and they <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> share it." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini {{remarked to}} the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the {{completed}} album. [...] Albini commented {{years later that}} in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation [...] "from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. [...] All I know is... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. [...] A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's <b>all</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be redone". [...] While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. [...] Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author [...] "ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [...] information"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. [...] Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek {{to complain about the}} article.|$|E
