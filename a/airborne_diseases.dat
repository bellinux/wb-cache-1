25|$|Handwashing {{with soap}} {{consistently}} at critical moments {{during the day}} prevents the spread of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes. Handwashing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact. People can become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, {{if they do not}} wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. As a general rule, hand washing protects people poorly or not at all from droplet and <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis.|$|E

50|$|Airborne {{transmission}} of disease depends on several physical variables endemic to the infectious particle. Environmental factors influence {{the efficacy of}} airborne disease transmission; the most evident environmental conditions are temperature and relative humidity. The sum of all {{the factors that influence}} temperature and humidity, either meteorological (outdoor) or human (indoor), as well as other circumstances influencing the spread of the droplets containing the infectious particles, as winds, or human behavior, sum up the factors influencing the {{transmission of}} <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E
50|$|Airborne {{pathogens}} or allergens often cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses and the lungs. This {{is caused}} by the inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents. Air pollution plays a significant role in <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases</b> which is linked to asthma. Pollutants are said to influence lung function by increasing air way inflammation.|$|E
50|$|Monocyclic {{epidemics}} {{are caused}} by pathogens with a low birth rate and death rate, meaning they only have one infection cycle per season.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{transmission}} of infectious <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> have focused on patient room {{air changes per hour}} (ACH) and how ACH provides pathogen dilution and removal. The logical but mostly unproven premise is that greater air change rates reduce the concentration of infectious particles and thus, the probability of <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission. Recently, {{a growing body of research}} suggests pathways between pathogenic source (patient) and control (exhaust) may be the dominant environmental factor. While increases in <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission have been associated with ventilation rates below 2 ACH, comparatively less data are available to quantify the benefits of higher air change rates in clinical spaces. As a result, a series of tests were conducted in an actual hospital to observe the containment and removal of respirable aerosols (0. 5 â€“ 10 Î¼m) with respect to ventilation rate and directional airflow in a general patient room, and, an airborne infectious isolation room. Higher ventilation rates were not found to be proportionately effective in reducing aerosol concentrations. Specifically, increasing mechanical ventilation from 2. 5 to 5. 5 ACH reduced aerosol concentrations only 30 % on average. However, particle concentrations were more than 40 % higher in pathways between the source and exhaust as was the suspension and migration of larger particles (3 â€“ 10 Î¼m) throughout the patient room(s). Computational analyses were used to validate the experimental results, and, to further quantify the effect of ventilation rate on exhaust and deposition removal in patient rooms as well as other particle transport phenomena...|$|R

50|$|An {{airborne}} {{disease is}} any disease that {{is caused by}} pathogens and transmitted through the air. Such diseases include many that are of considerable importance both in human and veterinary medicine. The relevant pathogens may be viruses, bacteria, or fungi, {{and they may be}} spread through coughing, sneezing, raising of dust, spraying of liquids, or similar activities likely to generate aerosol particles or droplets. Strictly speaking <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases</b> do not include conditions caused simply by air pollution such as dusts and poisons, though their study and prevention may be related.|$|E
50|$|Some ways {{to prevent}} <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases</b> include washing hands, using {{appropriate}} hand disinfection, getting regular immunizations against diseases believed to be locally present, wearing a respirator and limiting {{time spent in the}} presence of any patient likely {{to be a source of}} infection.Exposure to a patient or animal with an airborne disease does not guarantee receiving the disease. Because of the changes in host immunity and how much the host was exposed to the particles in the air makes a difference to how the disease affects the body.|$|E
50|$|HEPA {{filters are}} {{critical}} {{in the prevention of}} the spread of airborne bacterial and viral organisms and, therefore, infection. Typically, medical-use HEPA filtration systems also incorporate high-energy ultra-violet light units to kill off the live bacteria and viruses trapped by the filter media.

40|$|Following {{the recent}} severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome epidemics and worldwide {{concern about the}} next pandemic, whether influenza or multiple drug resistant tuberculosis, has underlined the importance of effective interventions into <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission in indoor environments in a community. The engineering control measures available include ventilation dilution, use of high-efficiency particulate air filters in a room or in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation devices in ceiling area of a room or in the HVAC system. These methods are known to be effective in controlling or delaying <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission in a single enclosure in both healthcare facilities and the community. However, there have been no studies of their relative effectiveness at the community level. This paper presents mathematical modeling of some engineering control strategies with a focus on ventilation and corresponding analysis of their relative effectiveness compared with other public health interventions in disease control in indoor environments at the community level. The results should help us to determine the most effective intervention strategies. We conclude that the engineering intervention methods such as building ventilation can be as effective as public health interventions and the ventilation rates specified in the existing standards such as ASHRAE 62 may be too low for the purpose of preventing or controlling <b>airborne</b> infectious <b>diseases</b> in indoor environments.

50|$|A {{surgical}} mask, {{also known}} as a procedure mask, is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosols from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, such as N95 or NIOSH masks which provide better protection due to their material, shape and tight seal.Surgical masks are popularly worn by the general public in East Asian countries to reduce the chance of spreading <b>airborne</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Airborne</b> <b>diseases</b> {{can also}} affect non-humans. For example, Newcastle disease is an avian disease that affects {{many types of}} {{domestic}} poultry worldwide which is transmitted via airborne contamination.Often, airborne pathogens or allergens cause inflammation in the nose, throat, sinuses, and the upper airway lungs. Upper airway inflammation causes coughing congestion, and sore throat. This {{is caused by the}} inhalation of these pathogens that affect a person's respiratory system or even the rest of the body. Sinus congestion, coughing and sore throats are examples of inflammation of the upper respiratory air way due to these airborne agents.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airborne</b> <b>diseases</b> {{include any}} that are caused and {{transmitted}} through the air. Some are of great medical importance. The pathogens transmitted may be {{any kind of}} microbe, {{and they may be}} spread in aerosols, dust or liquids. The aerosols might be generated from sources of infection such as the bodily secretions of an infected animal or person, or biological wastes such as accumulate in lofts, caves, garbage and the like. Such infected aerosols may stay suspended in air currents long enough to travel for considerable distances, though the rate of infection decreases sharply with the distance between the source and the organism infected.|$|E
50|$|Avian {{influenza}} is {{most often}} spread by contact between infected and healthy birds, though can also be spread indirectly through contaminated equipment. The virus is found in secretions from the nostrils, mouth, and eyes of infected birds {{as well as their}} droppings. HPAI infection is spread to people often through direct contact with infected poultry, such as during slaughter or plucking. Though the virus can spread through <b>airborne</b> secretions, the <b>disease</b> itself is not an <b>airborne</b> <b>disease.</b> Highly pathogenic strains spread quickly among flocks and can destroy a flock within 28 hours; the less pathogenic strains may affect egg production but are much less deadly.|$|R
40|$|Background: Room {{ventilation}} {{is a key}} {{determinant of}} <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission. Despite this, ventilation guidelines in hospitals are not founded on robust scientific evidence related to the prevention of airborne transmission. Methods: We sought to assess the effect of ventilation rates on influenza, tuberculosis, and rhinovirus infection risk within 3 distinct rooms in a major urban hospital: a lung function laboratory, an emergency department negative-pressure isolation room, and an outpatient consultation room. Air-exchange rate measurements were performed in each room using CO as a tracer. The model developed by Gammaitoni and Nucci was used to estimate infection risk. Results: Current outdoor air-exchange rates in the lung function laboratory and emergency department isolation room limited infection risks to 0. 1 %- 3. 6 %. Influenza risk for individuals entering an outpatient consultation room after an infectious individual departed ranged from 3. 6 % to 20. 7 %, depending on the duration for which each person occupied the room. Conclusion: Given the absence of definitive ventilation guidelines for hospitals, air-exchange measurements combined with modeling afford a useful means of assessing, on a case-by-case basis, the suitability of room ventilation for preventing <b>airborne</b> <b>disease</b> transmission...|$|R
