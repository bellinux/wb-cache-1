5|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} varieties {{of the standard}} language that <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> geographical areas of varying size (regions, historical provinces, cities, towns, etc.). In mass media {{it is no longer}} uncommon for journalists to speak with a distinct regional accent, but the most common pronunciation and the one perceived as the most formal is still Central Standard Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally {{these terms}} <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> certain {{geographical}} areas although {{some may be}} used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured {{by most of the}} children playing together.|$|E
5|$|Whitney High School fields eleven boys' {{sports teams}} and twelve girls' sports teams. Nearly all sports have teams of both genders, {{although}} exceptions do exist: baseball and football <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> males, while cheerleading, drill team, softball, and team tennis <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> females. Whitney's sports teams {{participate in the}} Pioneer Valley League, which includes six other high schools in El Dorado County, Placer County, Nevada County, and Sacramento County. Whitney's football team won the Sac-Joaquin Section championships in 2008; they were runners-up to Oakdale High School the previous year and reached the championships again in 2009. Likewise, the girls' soccer team won the Sac-Joaquin Section championships in 2009. Nazir Rasooli was the champion of the 2009 Sac-Joaquin Section Wrestling Championship, {{and was the first}} Whitney wrestler to qualify for the State championship.|$|E
50|$|The host {{specificity}} of this parasite is uncertain. Either it <b>was</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> the scimitar-horned oryx and became extinct during captive breeding of the host, or - alternatively - it may <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> the addax and possibly still surviving in the wild.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and {{have the potential to}} be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> {{individual}} insect {{host species}} {{and have been}} shown to be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Export is {{a special}} resource, only {{available}} to the three Asian civilizations, and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from the consulate, where the player can choose a foreign ally or, for the Japanese, isolationism. Export is generated automatically when the villagers are gathering, but its gather rate is much slower than other resources, making it challenging to afford a large foreign army. Export Rate / Experience points are also generated by other means (like sacred cows for Indians) and <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> each clan.|$|E

50|$|In {{investment}} analysis, betavexity {{is a form}} of convexity that <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> {{the beta}} coefficient of a long tailed investment (i.e. mortality risk). It is similar in nature to bond convexity or gamma that are exhibited in financial products such as bonds or options but <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> portfolios replicating indices of shorter maturities.|$|R
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have}} a uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same size or with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to independent movements, the party can create formations, with specific formations triggering different status buffs such as regenerating HP or AP. New formations are acquired {{through the course}} of the game, and <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> characters. Following each battle, characters gain both experience points and ability points; the former raises their experience level and general statistics, while the latter are used as currency to unlock more or upgrade existing abilities. Each character's equipment can be enhanced through the combined effects of assigning types of equipment and items or accessories to a particular character, strengthening their abilities. In {{addition to}} standard battles, characters have access to mechs with their own move sets and abilities, with basic mechanics shared with normal battles.|$|E
5|$|Most {{information}} about the carucage comes from the financial records associated with its collection, {{but there is no}} detailed description of the way it was collected or assessed, unlike the account of the workings of the Exchequer given in the Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer, written in about 1180. Government records such as the Pipe Rolls, the Memoranda Rolls, and other financial records, some of which <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> the carucage, have survived, and include records of assessments and receipts for the sums collected. There are also occasional references to the tax in medieval chronicles, supplementing the information found in the financial records.|$|E

S. reilianum f. sp. reilianum <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> sorghum and S. reilianum f. sp. zeae <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> maize. It <b>is</b> unknown why the two formae speciales cannot form spores on their respective non-favored hosts.|$|R
5000|$|Individualized - a {{training}} program should be tailored to each individual. Any program must <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> the goals of an individual, focusing on meaningful tasks. It must also <b>be</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> the individual state of health, including presence or history of injury. An assessment should be performed to help guide exercise selection and training load.|$|R
5|$|Some poetry types <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> {{particular}} {{cultures and}} genres {{and respond to}} characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may {{think of it as}} written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart {{features}} eight playable {{characters from}} the Mario series â€“ Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Bowser and Toad returned {{in all of}} the subsequent Mario Kart games starting with Mario Kart 64. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These powers <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and astrobiology. The {{discovery of}} extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater {{insight into the}} nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the tree of life is organized. Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial biochemistry and observe how it differs from that found on Earth. This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> Earth.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> Paris, {{perhaps the most}} densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocksâ€“ as Rastignac does continuallyâ€“ takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le PÃ¨re Goriot: the aristocratic area around the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la ChaussÃ©e-d'Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-GeneviÃ¨ve.|$|E
5|$|Three {{positions}} <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> {{the field}} goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's {{job is to}} snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E

50|$|With newer x86 {{processor}}s, {{the processor}} cache {{can be used}} as RAM until DRAM is initialized. The processor cache has to be initialized into Cache-as-RAM mode as well, but this needs fewer instructions than initializing DRAM. Also, the Cache-as-RAM mode initialization <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> CPU architectures, thus more generic than DRAM initialization, which <b>is</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> each chipset and mainboard.|$|R
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, with {{a limited}} number of player units and enemy units each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are won by the player {{defeating}} key enemy units such as commanders and other boss characters. In battle, the game transitions to a dedicated battle arena, where the battle plays out in real-time. Each action yields experience points (EXP), and when the character earns 100 EXP, they level up, their health increases, and their class-specified statistics are randomly raised. During missions, towns and secret vendors can be visited, where new items such as healing potions, weapons and armor can be purchased. Weapons and armor <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> different characters, and each weapon has a limited lifespan before breaking when it reaches its limit. Currency is limited to certain scripted or player-driven events, or wagering on arena battles. If a character falls in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them from subsequent missions {{and the rest of the}} storyline. The game ends if Marth falls in battle.|$|E
5|$|Catwoman {{is another}} playable {{character}} available via the Catwoman campaign, which was initially downloadable content (DLC) on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles but was later {{included with the}} PC version and Game of the Year editions. Catwoman's campaign features her own heist-focused storyline that intersects with the main story at specific points in the game. Her combat emphasizes agility and allows {{for the use of}} unique weapons such as clawed gauntlets, bolas, and her iconic whip. A portion of the Riddler challenges <b>are</b> <b>specific</b> <b>to</b> Catwoman and can only be completed by her. Batman's allies Robin and Nightwing are also playable via optional DLC and feature their own combat abilities and gadgets. Both characters are available in the challenge maps; Robin has his own main story narrative.|$|E
