5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} in <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes.</b> The ship was in poor {{condition}} {{at the time}} due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. The destruction of the ship caught the Allies by surprise; her loss came {{during the height of}} the bombardment. Torpedo boats and other smaller vessels rushed to pick up survivors, but they rescued only a handful of men. From her complement of 710 men, some 660 were killed in the sinking.|$|E

5|$|The {{carriage}} {{was nearly}} identical to the carriage of the M-30. It had suspension and steel wheels with pneumatic rubber tires. The trails were initially of riveted construction, but were eventually replaced in production by welded ones. Late production pieces were equipped with caster wheels to ease manhandling. Time to set up for combat was <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes.</b> In an emergency {{it was possible to}} fire without splitting trails; however this was at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). Since the gun was not equipped with a limber, it could be towed only by vehicle. The maximum towing speed was 40km/h on paved roads, 30km/h on cobbled roads and 10km/h off-road. To give the crew some protection from bullets and shell fragments, the gun was fitted with a shield.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to examine the}} effects of time {{pressure}} and attributions on a simple task. It was hypothesized that under time pressure, participants would, report lower stress levels when given a stress relief object. A total of 40 participants took part in this study. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions and told to complete a word search. Participants were either told or not told <b>about</b> a <b>two</b> <b>minute</b> limit and provided or not provided a stress ball during the task. Stress balls were used to determine whether participants experiencing pressure from a time limit would attribute stress relief to the object. After the passage of <b>two</b> <b>minutes,</b> participants were asked to rate level of stress experienced during the task. The results obtained did not support the experimental hypothesis. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, a 15-yard penalty against Vikings lineman John Randle and a 29-yard {{completion}} from Young to Stokes set up Kirby's second touchdown {{of the day}} to put the Niners up 38-14 before Cunningham led a desperate comeback attempt. After finishing a 73-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Matthew Hatchette that cut the score to 38-22, he led the team to the 49ers 16-yard line with <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> left in the game. But after spiking the ball on first down, he threw three consecutive incompletions, resulting in a turnover on downs that allowed San Francisco to run {{out the rest of the}} clock.|$|E
25|$|Erin's Isle {{remained}} in Royal Navy service after the Armistice with Germany.

In game five, Buffalo was up 3–0 {{at the end of the}} first period, but Philadelphia scored three goals to send the game to {{overtime}}. However, Tyler Ennis of Buffalo would score the overtime winner. In game six, Buffalo looked in good position to win after being up 3–1 after the first period, but Philadelphia rallied back, winning the game 5–4 on Ville Leino's overtime winner. In game seven, Philadelphia went up 4–0 <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> into the third period on a goal by Leino.

Then she had to look her husband in the face, who had gone to such expense and been so kind for her sake, and make that gentleman believe she was {{thoroughly}} happy; and, finally, she had to keep an eye upon No. 4 senior, who, as she was perfectly certain, was <b>about</b> in <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> to be lost for ever, or trampled to pieces in the crowd.|$|R
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes,</b> and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E
25|$|In {{large-scale}} galley-to-galley engagements, tactics remained {{essentially the}} same {{until the end of}} the 16th century. Cannons and small firearms were introduced around the 14th century, but did not have immediate effects on tactics; the same basic crescent formation in line abreast that was employed at the battle of Lepanto in 1571 was used by the Byzantine fleet almost a millennium earlier. Artillery on early gun galleys was not used as a long-range standoff weapon against other gun-armed ships. The maximum distance at which contemporary cannons were effective, c. 500m (1600ft), could be covered by a galley in <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes,</b> much faster than the reload time of any heavy artillery. Gun crews would therefore hold their fire until the last possible moment, somewhat similar to infantry tactics in the pre-industrial era of short range firearms. The weak points of a galley remained the sides and especially the rear, the command center. Unless one side managed to outmaneuver the other, battle would be met with ships crashing into each other head on. Once fighting began with ships locking on to one another bow to bow, the fighting would be fought over the front line ships. Unless a galley was completely overrun by an enemy boarding party, fresh troops could be fed into the fight from reserve vessels in the rear.|$|E
25|$|In fall of that year, Sweetland began {{football}} {{practice on}} September 4, 1900 with 10 returning {{players from the}} 1899 team. His team finished {{the season with a}} 7–2–1 record including victories over Amherst and Oberlin. One of his losses was to his former school, Cornell by a score of 6–0. Syracuse coming into the game did have several advantages that made their fans optimistic that the Orange could pull out a victory. First the game was being played early in the season, September, 29th. The Orangemen had been practicing for several weeks longer than Cornell. The second benefit was a large crowd of Syracuse rooters attended the game. Even with the game being played at Cornell's Percy Field, Syracuse rooters filled half the grand stand and part of the bleachers. The third advantage was that Cornell's captain, Raymond Starbuck, had been hurt earlier in practice and could not play. Sweetland's team started out strongly and had several opportunities to score. Early in the game, after stopping Cornell on their first possession, Syracuse drove the ball into scoring position at the Cornell's 15 yard line but could not score. Later, just before half time, Cornell returned a fumble to the Syracuse's seven yard line but Sweetland's defence stopped them from scoring and took over on downs. Then in Syracuse's next possession, Carr, Syracuse's half-back, went {{through a hole in the}} Cornell line and ran seventy yards before Cornell's halfback A. B. Morrison caught him to prevent a touchdown. The game remained tied until <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>minutes</b> to play when Cornell's Morrison ran 25 yards for a touchdown. After the game Cornell accused Coach Sweetland's team of rough and dirty play.|$|E
