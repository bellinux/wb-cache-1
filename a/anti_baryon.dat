We {{report on the}} development of a framework allowing detailed studies with special attention given to the hadronization phase. In our model, implemented in the Pythia event generator, the baryon number violating vertex is associated with the appearance of a junction in the colour confinement field. This allows us to tell where to look for the extra (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryon</b> directly associated with the baryon number violating decay. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{kinetics}} of antibaryon production and annihilation in an expanding system, assuming {{that it is}} spatially homogeneous and chemically equilibrated at the initial stage. By solving simplified rate equations for (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryon</b> abundances we study the deviations from chemical equilibrium at late stages. The calculations are done for different expansion rates and net-baryon-to-entropy ratios, covering the conditions from early Universe to heavy-ion collisions. Our analysis includes both stable (anti) baryons and resonances. We conclude that residual antibaryon abundances {{are very sensitive to}} the time scales of expansion. Our calculations naturally explain noticeable deviations of antiproton-to-pion and proton-to-pion ratios observed in nuclear collisions at the LHC energy from the thermal model predictions. We conclude that at high bombarding energies the chemical freeze-out of (anti) baryons should occur at lower temperatures as compared to mesons. Comment: 24 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|NA 61 /SHINE is a {{fixed target}} {{experiment}} designed to study hadron-proton, hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron. In this proceeding we present results on spectra of identified hadrons produced in pion-carbon production interactions, which are of fundamental importance {{to improve the}} extensive air shower modeling, and hence the interpretation of ultra-high-energy-cosmic-rays measurements. In particular, our measurements of (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryons</b> and ρ^ 0 production in pion-carbon interactions can contribute to improve the predictions of muon production by air shower simulations using hadronic interaction models. In this contribution we discuss the data analysis and the results from pion-carbon collisions recorded at beam momenta of 158 and 350 GeV/c. The preliminary spectra of K^± and p(p̅) are shown, {{as well as a}} comparison to predictions of hadronic interaction models used in air shower simulations. Additionally, we present final results on the production of ρ^ 0, ω and K^ 0 * resonances. Comment: Proceedings of 35 th International Cosmic Rays Conference, Busan, South Kore...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a spherical volume of hot and dense hadronic matter (fireball) expanding into a vacuum. It {{is assumed that}} initially the fireball matter is in local thermal and chemical equilibrium with vanishing collective velocity. The time evolution of the fireball is studied in parallel within the GiBUU transport model and an ideal hydrodynamic model. The equation of state of an ideal hadronic gas {{is used in the}} hydrodynamic calculation. The same set of hadronic species is used in transport and fluid-dynamical simulations. Initial coordinates and momenta of hadrons in transport simulations have been randomly generated by using the Fermi and Bose distributions for (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryons</b> and mesons. The model results for radial profiles of densities and collective velocities of different hadronic species are compared at different times. We find that two considered models predict essential differences in time evolution of hadron abundances, which are especially pronounced for hyperonic species. This gives an evidence of a strong deviation from chemical equilibrium in expanding hadronic matter. Comment: 23 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{cross-over}} {{region of}} the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy ion collisions {{is influenced by the}} nearby deconfinement, chiral and baryon condensation phase transitions. A characteristic signature of the deconfinement transition in this region can be infered using the flux tube model, which is dual to the Polyakov loop description and which offers a visual picture of what happens during the transition. The three-point (anti) vertices of a flux tube network lead to formation of (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryons</b> upon hadronisation. Since there is no fundamental interaction associated with the baryon number, correlations in the baryon number distribution at the last scattering surface directly reflect the preceding pattern of the flux tube vertices in the QGP. An alternating pattern of vertices and antivertices would lead to an oscillatory signal in the two-point baryon number correlations, under the experimental conditions prevalent in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The strength of the oscillations {{is a measure of the}} flexibility of the QGP. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures. Talk presented at Lattice 2012, Cairns, Australia. (v 2) Typos corrected.

40|$|We {{study the}} handbag {{contribution}} to two-photon annihilation into baryon-antibaryon pairs at large energy and momentum transfer. We derive factorization {{of the process}} amplitude into a hard gamma gamma -> q qbar subprocess and form factors describing the soft q qbar -> B Bbar transition, assuming that the process is dominated by configurations where the (anti) quark approximately carries the full momentum of the (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryon.</b> The form factors represent moments of time-like generalized parton distributions, so-called B Bbar distribution amplitudes. A characteristic feature of the handbag mechanism {{is the absence of}} isospin-two components in the final state, which in combination with flavor symmetry provides relations among the form factors for the members of the lowest-lying baryon octet. Assuming dominance of the handbag contribution, we can describe current experimental data with form factors of plausible size, and predict the cross sections of presently unmeasured B Bbar channels.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{possibility}} that partonic matter produced at early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is out of chemical equilibrium. It is assumed that initially this matter is mostly composed of gluons, but quarks and antiquarks are produced at later times. The dynamical evolution of partonic system is described by the Bjorken-like ideal hydrodynamics with a time dependent quark fugacity. The results of this model are compared with those obtained by assuming the complete chemical equilibrium of partons already at the initial stage. It is shown that in a chemically non-equilibrium scenario the entropy gradually increases, and about 25 % of the total final entropy is generated during the hydrodynamic evolution of deconfined matter. We argue that the (anti) quark suppression included in this approach {{may be responsible for}} reduced (<b>anti)</b> <b>baryon</b> to meson ratios observed in heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies.

Baryons and anti-baryons (#XI#"- and anti #XI#"+; #SIGMA#(1385) "- and anti #SIGMA#(1385) "+ as well as #SIGMA#(1385) "+ and anti #SIGMA#(1385) "-) are produced with equal cross sections. The measured cross sections have been compared with three Monte Carlo simulations, based on (1) the colour-dipole-model (CDM), on (2) calculations of the zeroth and first order matrix elements complemented by parton shower calculations (MEPS) and on (3) HERWIG. In CDM and MEPS the fragmentation is modelled using JETSET, which is based on the Lund-string model. The CDM and MEPS Monte Carlo models with the default strange-quark suppression factor (#gamma#_s= 0. 3) overestimate the measured #XI#"- and #SIGMA#(1385) "#+-# cross sections, while HERWIG overestimates the cross sections even more. Even a lower value of the strangeness suppression factor of #gamma#_s= 0. 2 does not lead to an agreement between experimental data and both CDM and MEPS. The parameters PARJ(4) and PARJ(18) of JETSET set the probability of producing a baryon with a certain spin during fragmentation. The change of these parameters (#gamma#_s= 0. 2, PARJ(4) = 0. 025 and PARJ(18) = 0. 5) produces agreement between Monte Carlo and experimental data. Also, the influence of the new set of JETSET parameters on the predicted cross sections of K_s" 0, #LAMBDA# and #phi#(1020) production has been investigated and found to be in reasonable agreement with all strange particle measurements at HERA so far. The shapes of the measured differential #XI#"- and #SIGMA#(1385) "#+-# baryon cross sections as a function of Q" 2, x, #eta# and p_T are reasonably reproduced by the HERWIG, CDM and MEPS Monte Carlos.
