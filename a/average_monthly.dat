5|$|Cyclone Jasmine {{affected}} fivecountries {{during its}} existence. The predecessor to Jasmine brought heavy rainfall to areas of extreme northern Queensland.

5|$|Tropical {{activity}} {{continued through}} April and May, with two tropical cyclones {{in the former}} month. In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24hours than the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> total. Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded to exit the basin on May4 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Rammasun {{passed a}} short {{distance}} west of Cheju-do, an island offshore South Korea, dropping more than 300mm (12in) of rainfall. High surf killed one person on the island, and officials restricted access to Hallasan mountain and all parks. Seven boats were damaged, and many roads on the island were flooded. Before Rammasun struck the South Korean mainland, airline officials canceled 167flights. There were three deaths on the mainland, including one boy who drowned in floodwaters. Damage in the country totaled $9.5million, much of it property damage; there was also damage to the rice crop. Rainfall extended into neighboring North Korea, damaging rice and maize. Later, Rammasun brought the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> rainfall in only two days in portions of Primorsky Krai, causing flooding along roads and riverways.|$|E

5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed {{only to those}} deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to be}} armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E
5|$|While Chataan {{was in its}} {{formative}} {{stages and}} still tied to the monsoon trough, it produced a large area of heavy rainfall and strong winds that affected Pohnpei and Chuuk in the FSM. The storm passed very near Chuuk with wind gusts of 82km/h (51mph). In the day before Chataan affected the island, it dropped torrential rainfall due to its elongated structure and slow movement. Persistent winds from the larger monsoon trough generated high surf and tides of 0.3m (1ft) above normal across the region. The most significant effects were from the rainfall, peaking at 954mm (37.5in) at the Chuuk Weather Service Office over 13days. The highest 24-hour total was 506mm (19.9in) on Weno Island, of which 361mm (14.2in) fell in 12hours; this was greater than the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> rainfall total for the station.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, the {{rainfall}} in {{one week}} represented the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> values at some stations. Heavy rainfall from the depression caused levels to rise along rivers and creeks. A bridge that had been rebuilt following earlier Tropical Storm Arthur was flooded, prompting the Belize Defence Force to assist in crossings. This isolated much of Cayo District {{from the rest of}} the country until the bridge was repaired. On the western portion of the district, flooding along the Macal River damaged a bridge crossing into northern Guatemala, which restricted traffic only to people returning home. Levels along the Macal and the Belize River were higher than the floods of Hurricane Mitch in 1998, but less than that of Hurricane Keith in 2000. The floods caused residents to evacuate after over 1,000homes were flooded; 311people stayed in shelters, while the remainder stayed with families and relatives. Of the affected houses, 12 were destroyed and 802 were severely damaged. Most of the affected population was in rural areas of western Belize. One village in Orange Walk District had to be quarantined due to the health threat from the floods for 25days. Many roads were closed, and there were widespread school closures. Overall, the floods killed two people in the country and caused BZ$54.1million (BZD, $27.1million USD) in damage. Most of the damage was agricultural, accounting for BZ$28.2million (BZD, $14.1million USD), or 25% of the country's agricultural gross domestic product. Other damage included BZ$11.7million (BZD, $6.3million USD) to roads and bridges. The ongoing floods caused BZ$2.7million (BZD, $1.5million USD) in tourism losses, due to closed facilities and water damage.|$|E
