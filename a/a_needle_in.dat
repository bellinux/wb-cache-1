5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> <b>In</b> modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

25|$|Klee {{began to}} {{introduce}} a new technique in 1905: scratching on a blackened glass panel with <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> <b>In</b> that manner he created about 57 Verre églomisé pictures, among those the 1905 Gartenszene (Scene on a Garden) and the 1906 Porträt des Vaters (Portrait of a Father), with which he tried to combine painting and scratching. Klee's solitary early work ended in 1911, the year he met and {{was inspired by the}} graphic artist Alfred Kubin, and became associated with the artists of the Blaue Reiter.|$|E

25|$|Abortive therapies for {{migraine}}s may be oral, if the migraine is mild to moderate, or {{may require}} stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly. Mild to moderate headaches should first {{be treated with}} acetaminophen (paracetamol) or NSAIDs, like ibuprofen. If accompanied by nausea or vomiting, an antiemitic such as metoclopramide (Reglan) can be given orally or rectally. Moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan, a medication which mimics serotonin (an agonist) and causes mild vasoconstriction. If accompanied by nausea and vomiting, parenteral (through <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the skin) triptans and antiemetics can be given.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{clinical}} experience with brachial plexus block in both peacetime and wartime surgery was extensive, and {{new approaches to}} this technique began to be described. For example, In 1946, F. Paul Ansbro {{was the first to}} describe a continuous brachial plexus block technique. He secured <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> the supraclavicular fossa and attached tubing connected to a syringe through which he could inject incremental doses of local anesthetic. The subclavian perivascular block was first described by Winnie and Collins in 1964. This approach became popular due to its lower risk of pneumothorax compared to the traditional Kulenkampff approach. The infraclavicular approach was first developed by Raj. In 1977, Selander described a technique for continuous brachial plexus block using an intravenous catheter secured in the axilla.|$|E

[...] "I couldn't do the first step [...] I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it." [...] In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center, [...] "What they do is an IV treatment where they put <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had a gut feeling that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E
500|$|Wind {{damage was}} {{generally}} minimal as the small hurricane crossed Florida, except to citrus crops and snapped vegetation in some areas. According {{to a survey}} by local fire officials, the calm eye was observed from Hobe Sound to the edge of Stuart, during which passage [...] "hardly <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> pine trees {{along the side of the}} road could be seen moving." [...] Peak winds estimated or registered at [...] affected the coast between Stuart and Fort Pierce. The winds downed several telegraph poles and destroyed a structure at Stuart, but otherwise little damage resulted. Initial reports from Fort Pierce signaled no uprooted trees. Farther south, apart from a snapped coconut palm, the town of Palm Beach evinced little damage to foliage. In Fort Pierce, heavier losses to grapefruit were accounted at about 25%, especially in exposed groves, and some trees suffered total loss of fruit. Shrubs and roofs in the city were damaged as well, but power and water services were quickly revived as the worst of the storm passed. Final losses to citrus in the Indian River region were tallied at 10–20%, with much greater tolls locally. Avocado and mango trees also sustained significant damage. A minimum pressure of [...] occurred in Stuart, the same as in Jupiter—both unusually high for a hurricane, though likely related to the storm's small size. In fact, contemporary meteorologists concluded that the storm had only hit Florida at tropical storm strength, with top winds of [...] in Stuart.|$|E

2500|$|The MythBusters {{typically}} test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, {{the steps}} {{were described as}} [...] "replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results" [...] by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, {{to determine whether the}} alleged result occurs; if that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result. Occasionally the team (usually Savage and Hyneman) will hold a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal (for example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> a haystack).|$|E
2500|$|A {{threshold}} {{problem for}} conserving this species is locating them. [...] Other right whale species can reliably {{be found on}} their feeding grounds (North Atlantic right whale), or on their wintering grounds (both North Atlantic and Southern right whale). In contrast, there are no reliable places where researchers can find North Pacific right whales. [...] In the eastern portion of their range, {{there are so few}} whales that researchers have described it looking for <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> a haystack. In the western portion of their range, the ability of researchers to find right whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands is greatly hindered by the difficulty and expense of getting access to these areas which are in Russian territorial waters and EEZ, and by the fog that makes visibility minimal.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} quality of {{duodenal}} and ileal samples obtained with different biopsy forceps. MethodsFifteen dogs were included in a prospective ex vivo study.

The biopsy forceps evaluated had alligator jaws or cups with smooth edge with or without <b>a</b> <b>needle.</b> ResultsThe global quality of the biopsies was better in the ileum that in the duodenum regardless of the biopsy forceps. Biopsy forceps with smooth edge including <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> resulted <b>in</b> fewer artefacts than biopsy forceps with smooth edge but no <b>needle</b> <b>in</b> both sites and those with alligator jaws without <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> provided deeper biopsies than those with smooth edge without <b>a</b> <b>needle</b> only <b>in</b> the duodenum. There was no effect of the biopsy forceps type {{on the size of}} the biopsies. Clinical SignificanceOur findings may aid in choosing the appropriate type of forceps for intestinal biopsy...|$|R
