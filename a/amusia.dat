25|$|<b>Amusia</b> is {{a musical}} {{disorder}} that appears mainly as a defect in processing pitch but also encompasses musical memory and recognition. Two main classifications of <b>amusia</b> exist: acquired <b>amusia,</b> which occurs {{as a result}} of brain damage, and congenital <b>amusia,</b> which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two general}} classifications of amusia: {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> and acquired <b>amusia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of acquired <b>amusia</b> {{are much more}} variable than those of congenital <b>amusia</b> and {{are determined by the}} location and nature of the lesion. Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive <b>amusia),</b> the ability to play an instrument (instrumental <b>amusia</b> or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial <b>amusia),</b> the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic <b>amusia).</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{search of}} hemispheric {{dominance}} for {{music has been}} for long the main aim {{of the study of}} <b>amusias.</b> Musical abilities were first localized in the left hemisphere, then in the right one. In the light of the available data, these two diverging conceptions do not appear paradoxial anymore. Indeed, brain injury on either side can provoke musical deficits. However, the nature of the deficit seems to depend on the particular hemisphere damaged. Right-sided lesions appear to disturb the melodic aspects of musical sequences while left-sided lesions seem to deteriorate the rhythmic aspects. Although the clinical literature involves insightful suggestions on how the muscical abilities are organized, especially with respect to linguistic functions, these indications are not sufficient to provide a clear picture {{of the nature of the}} functional differences for music between hemispheres. Research is not systematic. Comment and suggestions are proposed to guide future investigations. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Previous genetic {{studies showed}} an {{association}} between variations in the gene coding for the 1 a receptor of the neuro-hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) and musical working memory (WM). The current study set out to test the influence of intranasal administration (INA) of AVP on musical as compared to verbal WM using a double blind crossover (AVP â€“ placebo) design. Two groups of 25 males were exposed to 20 IU of AVP in one session, and 20 IU of saline water (placebo) in a second session, one week apart. In each session subjects completed the tonal subtest from Gordon&# 39;s Musical Aptitude Profile, the interval subtest from the Montreal Battery for Evaluation of <b>Amusias</b> (MBEA), and the forward and backward digit span tests. Scores in the digit span tests were not influenced by AVP. In contrast, in the music tests there was an AVP effect. In the MBEA test, scores for the group receiving placebo in the first session (PV) were higher than for the group receiving vasopressin in the first session (VP) (p <. 05) with no main Session effect nor Group * Session interaction. In the Gordon test there was a main Session effect (p <. 05) with scores higher in the second {{as compared to the}} first session, a marginal main Group effect (p =. 093) and a marginal Group X Session interaction (p = 0. 88). In addition we found that the group that received AVP in the first session scored higher on scales indicative of happiness, and alertness on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, (PANAS). Only in this group and only in the music test these scores were significantly correlated with memory scores. Together the results reflect a complex interaction between AVP, musical memory, arousal, and contextual effects such as session, and base levels of memory. The results are interpreted in light of music&# 39;s universal use as a means to modulate arousal on the one hand, and AVP&# 39;s influence on mood, arousal, and social interactions on the other...|$|R
25|$|<b>Amusia</b> has {{recently}} been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities. Research suggests that in congenital <b>amusia,</b> younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that <b>amusia</b> is related to dyslexia and other similar disorders. Research {{has been shown that}} <b>amusia</b> may be related to an increase in size of the cerebral cortex, which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and epilepsy are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital <b>amusia</b> may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder. Acquired <b>amusia,</b> on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing speech, much like aphasics lose speech selectively but can sometimes still sing. Other forms of <b>amusia</b> may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated dissociations between rhythm, melody, and emotional processing of music, and <b>amusia</b> may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.|$|E
25|$|Those with {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> show impaired {{performance on}} discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with intonational differences in pitch direction {{in their final}} word. This suggests that <b>amusia</b> can in subtle ways impair language processing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amusia</b> {{can also}} be related to aprosody, a {{disorder}} in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It {{has been found that}} both <b>amusia</b> and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere. They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with <b>amusia</b> from injury. There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amusia</b> is also {{similar to}} aphasia {{in that they}} affect similar {{areas of the brain}} near the {{temporal}} lobe. Most cases of those with <b>amusia</b> do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of <b>amusia,</b> especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other. In acquired <b>amusia,</b> inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as memory and learning, mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} question posed about congenital <b>amusia</b> {{is if it}} has a genetic origin. A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital <b>amusia.</b> Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. <b>Amusia</b> cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group. Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group. This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital <b>amusia</b> cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital <b>amusia,</b> was more musical. A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.|$|E
25|$|Many {{research}} studies {{of individuals with}} <b>amusia</b> show {{that a number of}} cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the primary auditory cortex, secondary auditory cortex, and limbic system are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to <b>amusia.</b> While various causes of <b>amusia</b> exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{much has been}} {{discovered}} about <b>amusia.</b> However, there remains {{a great deal more}} to learn. While a method of treatment for people with <b>amusia</b> has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying. However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with <b>amusia.</b> Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development. Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to <b>amusia</b> since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as dysphasia and dyslexia.|$|E
25|$|Acquired <b>amusia</b> is {{a musical}} {{disability}} that shares the same characteristics as congenital <b>amusia,</b> {{but rather than}} being inherited, it {{is the result of}} brain damage. It is also more common than congenital <b>amusia.</b> While {{it has been suggested that}} music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes. A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired <b>amusia</b> and contribute to its recovery. The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred. Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amusia</b> is {{also known}} as tone deafness. Amusics {{primarily}} have deficits in processing pitch. They also have problems with musical memory, singing and timing. Amusics also cannot tell melodies apart from their rhythm or beat. However, amusics can recognize other sounds at a normal level (i.e. lyrics, voices, and sounds from the environment), therefore demonstrating that <b>amusia</b> is not due to deficits in exposure, hearing or cognition.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{test results}} {{support the view that}} {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> is hereditary. It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development. However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital <b>amusia</b> shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched. This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.|$|E
25|$|Those with {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> show impaired {{ability to}} discriminate, identify and imitate the intonation {{of the final}} words in sentences.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>amusia</b> requires individuals to detect out-of-key notes in conventional but unfamiliar melodies. A behavioral failure on {{this test is}} diagnostic because there is typically no overlap between the distributions of the scores of amusics and controls. Such scores are generally obtained through the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of <b>Amusia</b> (MBEA), which involves {{a series of tests}} that evaluate the use of musical characteristics known to contribute to the memory and perception of conventional music. The battery comprises six subtests which assess the ability to discriminate pitch contour, musical scales, pitch intervals, rhythm, meter, and memory. An individual is considered amusic if he/she performs two standard deviations below the mean obtained by musically-competent controls. This musical pitch disorder represents a phenotype that serves to identify the associated neuro-genetic factors. Both MRI-based brain structural analyses and electroencephalography (EEG) are common methods employed to uncover brain anomalies associated with <b>amusia</b> (See Neuroanatomy). Additionally, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is used to detect anatomical differences between the MRIs of amusic brains and musically intact brains, specifically with respect increased and/or decreased amounts of white and grey matter.|$|E
25|$|Currently, no {{forms of}} {{treatment}} have proven effective in treating <b>amusia.</b> One study has shown tone differentiation techniques {{to have some}} success, however future research on treatment of this disorder {{will be necessary to}} verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than their}} {{inability}} to hear music, which is most likely due to a genetic defect, the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is {{on the ability to}} tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of <b>amusia</b> describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, <b>amusia</b> may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.|$|E
25|$|Congenital <b>amusia,</b> {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital <b>amusia</b> seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital <b>amusia</b> is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} {{that patients with}} <b>amusia</b> also have difficulty {{when it comes to}} spatial processing. Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not. Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{analyzes}} the temporal (rhythmic) components {{of music in}} two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping. Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production. Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired <b>amusia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} if Monica's disorder is <b>amusia,</b> she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note. Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group. Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music. Interestingly, a later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital <b>amusia</b> was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training {{does not seem}} to be necessary in the processing of chords and keys. The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular pulse, both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance. Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing. Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the tonic) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with <b>amusia,</b> this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.|$|E
25|$|Memory is {{required}} in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation. This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks. Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs, and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes. These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate <b>amusia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Results {{showed that}} there was no {{significant}} difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the frontal lobe and auditory cortex. Temporal lobe lesions were also observed in patients with <b>amusia.</b> [...] <b>Amusia</b> is a common occurrence following an ischemic MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage. While significant recovery takes place over time, <b>amusia</b> can persist for long periods of time. Test results suggest that acquired <b>amusia</b> and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of <b>amusia</b> are {{generally}} categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive <b>amusia,</b> {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar melodies, the loss of ability to read musical notation, and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes. Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write musical notation, and/or play an instrument. A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{is known}} that {{congenital}} <b>amusia</b> is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing. In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable [...] "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital <b>amusia</b> were poor singers. They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm. The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency. The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.|$|E
2500|$|In 1825, F. Gall {{mentioned}} a [...] "musical organ" [...] {{in a specific}} region {{of the human brain}} that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage. In 1865, Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a theory of cognition. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888-1890, August Knoblauch produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it <b>amusia.</b> This model for music processing was the earliest produced.|$|E
2500|$|This finding led {{to another}} test that was {{designed}} to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception. In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond [...] "yes" [...] if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond [...] "no" [...] if she could not detect a pitch change. [...] Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two semitones (whole tone), or half steps. While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, {{it does not seem to}} include speech intonation. This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music. In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital <b>amusia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With Babes in Toyland playing only {{sporadically}} in {{the late}} 1990s, Bjelland started the band Katastrophy Wife in 2000. The band toured at venues, such as Ladyfest, worldwide. Katastrophy Wife have released two albums, <b>Amusia</b> and All Kneel, {{as well as a}} single Heart On on the Australian record label Rish in April 2007. The single was intended as a trailer for a forthcoming album, Pregnant. Katstrophy Wife's vinyl debut was on an Independent label compilation called [...] "The Tundra Sessions." [...] Her song on the album was [...] "Sweetheart" [...] and is the first version of this song and {{not the same as the}} album version. There was an outtake entitled [...] "No Thing" [...] and both songs were recorded by Tim Mac. although as of 2011 the album has not been released. Bjelland also has co- created on soundtracks. On the Katastrophy Wife website, Bjelland stated that [...] "Katastrophy Wife have had a few incarnations but from here on I will only re-incarnate my self." [...] She produced the album The Seven Year Itch for the band Angelica, released in 2002.|$|E
