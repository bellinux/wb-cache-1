40|$|From the Foreword by Luks Kilcher, FiBL More than thirty-seven million {{hectares}} of agricultural land are managed organically by nearly 1. 8 million producers. About {{one-third of the}} world’s organic land – 13. 4 {{million hectares}} – is located in emerging markets and markets in transition. Global sales reached 55 billion USD in 2009, more than doubling in value from 25 billion USD in 2003. Europe is after the USA the second largest organic {{market in the world}} with a turnover of 26 billion USD in 2009. These figures increase year by year and such facts impressively illustrate the powerful development of the organic production and market all over the world. Behind these figures lie a large number of benefits and impacts, which are the motor for this development: organic agriculture is the choice of millions of farmers, as it aims to produce healthy food while establishing an ecological balance to prevent soil fertility and pest problems. With this edition, FiBL and SIPPO are presenting The Organic Market in Europe for the third time. Compared to the previous editions, this edition expanded considerably in geographical scope, now including the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and the new EU countries Czech Republic and Poland. The information on regulations, the statistics and market trends collected and compiled in this manual provide a guide with the most important information to successful market access in EFTA and EU countries. However, it can’t claim to be complete in all aspects, as especially market data are still scarce. The market data of this manual are therefore based on a mixture of statistics, estimations and experts opinions. This manual has three parts: Part A provides an overview on the organic market in Europe. Part B includes the four EFTA member states Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, giving Switzerland a more detailed look as {{it is one of the}} most developed organic markets in the world and also the home-base of the manual editors. Part C includes ten EU member countries: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The annex contains a comparison of the European and Swiss organic regulations, including Bio Suisse standards.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to present a comprehensive description of the relationship between linguistic <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> on the one hand, and social context of speech on the other. Based on one year 2 ̆ 7 s field research in Toono City, Iwate-ken, Northeastern Japan, the author examines a variety of linguistic forms used in self-reference, second person <b>address,</b> <b>and</b> third person <b>reference,</b> using the theoretical framework of the ethnography of speaking. ^ Material was collected in four ways: (1) Interviews, (2) Tape recording of conversations, (3) Participant observation, (4) Questionnaire. The author lived with a farming family in a hamlet of twenty-four households and concentrated on that hamlet and three other hamlets for detailed investigation. ^ The ethnographic description of Toono is given first, including: history, geography, subsistence, population, political structure. The social structure of the four focal hamlets is presented, with special emphasis on household, doozoku (kinship group based on the main house and branch house relationship), and shinrui (kindred). The primacy of household in the community structure is noted. The traditional descent group, doozoku, while still present, is seen as gradually merging with a more diffuse network of kin, shinrui. ^ Four categories of linguistic forms comprise the repertoire of <b>address</b> <b>and</b> reference: (1) Personal Names, (2) Personal Pronouns, (3) Kinship Terms, (4) House Names. The function of these terms is primarily that of status attribution, rather than description of specific social relationships. Kinship terms are examined from three perspectives: (1) Usage among relatives, (2) Usage as household status terms, (3) 2 ̆ 2 Fictive 2 ̆ 2 usage among unrelated people. House names of yagoo are examined comprehensively, i. e. their development and classification as well as their function of identifying specific households in a small face-to-face community. ^ Variation in terminological usage based on sex, age, social context, etc. is considered as evidence of dynamism in the relationship between language and social structure. Changing nature of the contemporary Japanese rural community is clearly reflected in the terms of <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>reference,</b> as residents adapt to a new life consisting of the two worlds of 2 ̆ 2 inside 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 outside. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R

In this paper, we are proposing a donor identification system to recognize the donors based on face recognition or through an Identification number. A centralized repository is maintained by the hospitals to store the required information of a donor which includes thumb impression, facial images and other basic details of the donor. In case of accidental death, the donor will be checked in our portal for verification about his organ donation and informed to the guardian. The process of taking the organ before the stipulated prescribed medical time will be initiated. In case of normal death, the person’s <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> number will be checked and based on that, the organs will be taken with a formal confirmation from their guardian.

Started from this notion of sociolinguistics, the writer developed his problem to find the social relationships between Doctor Ridgeon and his interlocutors through their use of terms of <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>references</b> toward each other. He used the qualitative approach to collect the data, and descriptive method for the analysis. The writer relied on Holmes' sociolinguistic theory in his analysis. The source of data was taken from Bernard Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma. The reason why the writer took the play was because it provided a complete varieties of terms of <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>references,</b> moreover the characters came from a different social background There were nine characters in this play. Emmy as the doctor's servant; Redpenny, the doctor's assistant; Leo Schutzmatcher, Ridgeon's college mate; Sir Patrick, a long time acquaintance; Cutler Walpole, a surgeon; Sir Ralph, the doctor's counterpart; Dr Bienkinsop, Ridgeon's friend who later became his patient; Lois Dubedat, a brilliant artist who had tuberculosis; and Jennifer Dubedat, Louis' wife who appealed the doctor's help. In his study, the writer found a different social relationships between Doctor Ridgeon and each interlocutor, compared with the relationships which already created by the author. The four social factors, participant, setting, topic and function were proved could influence those characters' choices of address form. The doctor and Emmy's social relationship was like a son and his mother. With Redpenny, the doctor had the relationship {{as a teacher and}} his pupil. Leo Shutzmacher and the doctor was close friends. Sir Patrick had a social relationship a like a father and his son, toward doctor Ridgeon.

40|$|Discrete {{temporal}} transitions {{occur in}} a variety of domains, but this work is mainly motivated by applications in molecular biology: explaining and analyzing observed transcriptome and proteome time series by literature and database knowledge. The starting point of a formal concept analysis model is presented. The objects of a formal context are states of the interesting entities, and the attributes are the variable properties defining the current state (e. g. observed presence or absence of proteins). Temporal transitions assign a relation to the objects, defined by deterministic or non-deterministic transition rules between sets of pre- and postconditions. This relation can be generalized to its transitive closure, i. e. states are related if one results from the other by a transition sequence of arbitrary length. The focus of the work is the adaptation of the attribute exploration algorithm to such a relational context, so that questions concerning temporal dependencies can be asked during the exploration process and be answered from the computed stem base. Results are given for the abstract example of a game and a small gene regulatory network relevant to a biomedical question.

This classification is basically undertaken by differentiating and identifying the semantic contents of the collected kinship terms. Further more detail descriptive analysis is done on the usage of the kinship terms in different social contexts, based on the information collected from field work reports. This study involves the descriptive type of methodology. Appropriately, wherever possible and necessary historical explanation of the form use and semantic of kinship terms are given in this paper. Descriptions of historical explanations are generally based on Tamil literatures and dictionaries. Out of 132 kinship terms collected through field work, we found out only 38 are identified to be common to lexicon, kriya and Jaffna spoken variety. Detail analysis was done to understand the functions of the kinship terms in Jaffna society.

Japanese {{hierarchical}} relations called senpai-koohai 'senior-junior', {{which in}} school {{are based on}} different class standings, have been observed to be salient and stable across different situations beyond school, once such relations are built between a pair of people (Dunn, 1996; Nakane, 1967 / 1972). However, presuming that such relations are static in nature is problematic in light of social constructionist views, especially {{because there are no}} studies that examine college students' dyadic or multiparty interactions in terms of their hierarchical relationship building. This dissertation examines how college students of different class levels interact in practice by analyzing multiparty interactions during an extracurricular activity at a Japanese college. Drawing on indexicality approaches (Ochs, 1992, 1993; Silverstein, 1983), I focus on three linguistic forms: speech styles, <b>address</b> <b>and</b> <b>reference</b> terms, <b>and</b> knowledge-related stance markers. The results of the analyses suggest that the construction of senpai-koohai relationships is influenced by two types of context of talk, on-stage and off-stage. During on-stage talk, the participants' club roles are foregrounded, which puts less focus on their senpai-koohai identities. During offstage talk, their identities are less influenced by their club roles, and this situation allows more freedom for other identities, which include senpai-koohai, to be constructed. A speaker's use of linguistic forms can be indexical to the context, while the meaning of a linguistic form is {{under the influence of the}} context. Moreover, the construction of senpai-koohai relations is also influenced by the content of the conversation. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates that, in the data analyzed, senpai-koohai relations among college students are much more fluid in nature than has been shown in previous studies...|$|R
