25|$|Ethanol is hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} absorbs water vapor {{directly}} from the atmosphere. Because <b>absorbed</b> <b>water</b> dilutes the fuel value of the ethanol and may cause phase separation of ethanol-gasoline blends (which causes engine stall), containers of ethanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed.

2500|$|Moisture {{absorption}} {{occurs when}} the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water may be also soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. <b>Absorbed</b> <b>water</b> can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuitboard materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating and cause cracking and delamination, the same effect responsible for [...] "popcorning" [...] damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the captain}} was {{ultimately}} responsible {{for the safety of}} passengers, the owners had made no effort to maintain or replace the ship's safety equipment. The fire hoses had been allowed to rot, and fell apart when the crew tried to put out the fire. The crew had never practiced a fire drill, and the lifeboats were tied up and inaccessible. (Some claim they were wired and painted in place.) Survivors reported that the life preservers were useless and fell apart in their hands. Desperate mothers placed life jackets on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating. [...] Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; victims found that their heavy wool clothing <b>absorbed</b> <b>water</b> and weighed them down in the river.|$|E

50|$|Isabel Annie Aves (née Michaelsen) (18 March 1887 - 15 October 1938) was a New Zealand {{abortion}}ist. She {{was born}} in Waipawa, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand on 18 March 1887.

5000|$|Plants {{originated}} in aquatic, {{from where they}} gradually migrated to land during their long course of evolution. In water or near it, plants could <b>absorb</b> <b>water</b> from their surroundings, with no need for any special absorbing organ or tissue. Additionally, in the primitive states of plant development, tissue differentiation and division of labor was minimal, thus the requirement for specialized <b>water</b> <b>absorbing</b> tissue was not required.

40|$|Recently Razmjou et al. {{proposed}} a smart method of using bilayer polymer hydrogels as draw agents to <b>absorb</b> <b>water</b> from saline streams and using solar energy to dewater the hydrated hydrogels.

The authors may misunderstand the swelling pressure of hydrogels as the osmotic pressure. The following discussion aims to clarify two confused concepts (i. e., osmotic pressure and swelling pressure) and to differentiate the principles of forward osmosis and of hydrogel <b>absorbing</b> <b>water</b> for both readers and the authors. It is believed that the clarification is very necessary because a number of published papers are based on these misunderstood concepts. 2 page(s...|$|R
