25|$|The {{breakthrough}} {{was started}} by Ivan Yefremov's utopian novel Andromeda Nebula (1957). He was soon followed by brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, who explored darker themes and social satire in their Noon Universe novels, such <b>as</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> be a God (1964) and Prisoners of Power (1969), {{as well as in}} their science fantasy trilogy Monday Begins on Saturday (1964). A good share of Soviet science fiction was aimed at children. Probably the best known was Kir Bulychov, who created Alisa Selezneva (1965-2003), a children's space adventure series about a teenage girl from the future.|$|E
25|$|A bayonet {{was issued}} for each rifle, and each was {{individually}} numbered to the rifle {{to which it}} belonged. The bayonet was a so-called sabre bayonet, with a yatagan (S-shaped) blade and a prominent fuller, a wooden grip and brass guard and pommel. By modern standards the bayonet was rather large, with a total length of 71cm (28in), of which 57cm (22.5in) was the blade. Today, a bayonet in original condition is <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find as the Krag–Petersson itself, and it is often mistaken for a Remington M1867 bayonet. A well-preserved bayonet can fetch around $1,000 U.S. {{if it is in}} good condition.|$|E
25|$|While a few {{offshore}} anchorage {{spots are}} marked on maps, Jarvis island has no ports or harbors, and swift currents are a hazard. There is a boat landing {{area in the}} middle of the western shoreline near a crumbling day beacon, and another near the southwest corner of the island. The center of Jarvis island is a dried lagoon where deep guano deposits accumulated, which were mined for about 20 years during the nineteenth century. The island has a tropical desert climate, with high daytime temperatures, constant wind, and strong sun. Nights, however, are quite cool. The ground is mostly sandy and reaches 23 feet (7 meters) at its highest point. Because of the island's distance from other large landmasses, the Jarvis Island high point is the 36th most isolated peak in the world. The low-lying coral island has long been noted <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> sight from small ships and is surrounded by a narrow fringing reef.|$|E

25|$|Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it {{is assumed}} that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V {{formation}} is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the upwash from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a V formation save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The formation also makes communication easier and allows the birds to maintain visual contact with each other.|$|E
500|$|Du Fu's {{popularity}} grew to such {{an extent}} that it is <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England: it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him. While there was never another Du Fu, individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work: Bai Juyi's concern for the poor, Lu You's patriotism, and Mei Yaochen's reflections on the quotidian are a few examples. More broadly, Du Fu's work in transforming the lǜshi from mere word play into [...] "a vehicle for serious poetic utterance" [...] set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre.|$|E
500|$|American historians Williamson Murray and Allan Millett {{wrote that}} Manstein's message to Hitler on 24 November advising {{him that the}} 6th Army should not break out, along with Göring's {{statements}} that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad, [...] "... sealed the fate of Sixth Army". Historians, including Gerhard Weinberg, {{have pointed out that}} Manstein's version of the events at Stalingrad in his memoir is distorted and several events described there were probably made up. [...] "Because of the sensitivity of the Stalingrad question in post-war Germany, Manstein worked <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> distort the record on this matter as on his massive involvement in the murder of Jews", wrote Weinberg.|$|E

500|$|Writing in 1986, Danny Peary noted, [...] "It's hard {{to believe}} that in 1967 we {{actually}} waited in anticipation for this so-called James Bond spoof. It was a disappointment then; it's a curio today, but just <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> get through." [...] Peary described the film as being [...] "disjointed and stylistically erratic" [...] and [...] "a testament to wastefulness in the bigger-is-better cinema," [...] before adding, [...] "It would have been a good idea to cut the picture drastically, perhaps down to the scenes featuring Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. In fact, I recommend you see it on television when it's in a two-hour (including commercials) slot. Then you won't expect it to make any sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The Christmas cantata A newborn child, before eternity, God! {{was given}} its first {{performance}} in 1996, commissioned by Kulturby 96 – the European Capital of Culture 1996.

The cantata was described by the reviewer of Jyllands-Posten <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> classify, with a [...] "religiously narrative robustness". The work sets text from a kontakion by the 6th century hymnographer Romanos the Melodist, translated into Danish by the theology professor Christian Thodberg, and edited by the priest Kristian Høeg.|$|E

[...] In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] According to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Robyn [...] "urges on this ode to friendship, mutual support and generally not being a fool who rushes in." [...] Tyler Grisham of Pitchfork noted that Robyn's [...] "vocals are echoed by a robotic self-harmony" [...] and that [...] "she seems to be encouraging herself twice <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> believe the song's words." [...] Speaking of the song, Robyn said, [...] "It’s a sweet song. Beautiful and bitter sweet, It’s about falling in love and being scared." ...|$|E

500|$|Close Encounters is {{the first}} {{collaboration}} between film editor Michael Kahn and Spielberg. Their working relationship has continued {{for the rest of}} Spielberg's films. Spielberg stated that no film he has ever made since has been <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> edit as the last 25 minutes of Close Encounters and he and Kahn would go through thousands of feet of footage just to find the right shots for the end sequence. When Kahn and Spielberg completed the first cut of the film, Spielberg was dissatisfied, feeling [...] "there wasn't enough wow-ness". Pick-ups were commissioned but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond could not participate due to other commitments. John A. Alonzo, László Kovács, and Douglas Slocombe worked on the pick-ups. Lacombe was originally to find Flight 19 hidden in the Amazon Rainforest, but the idea was changed to the Sonoran Desert. [...] Spielberg also took 7.5 minutes out from the preview.|$|E
500|$|The Fifth Element polarised critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times {{described}} {{the film as}} an [...] "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> follow as last year's [...]" [...] He concluded that The Fifth Element was [...] "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts {{some of the most}} sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see." [...] On film review show At the Movies, both Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "thumbs up"; in his own review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it [...] "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, [...] "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery. But at 127 minutes, which seems a reasonable length, it plays long." ...|$|E
500|$|West Ham manager Alan Pardew {{described}} the defeat <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> take: [...] "It {{felt like a}} defeat when the third goal went in. We rallied and had a great chance in extra time. We had to dig in. This was a top team we were playing, but I felt {{we were going to}} win. Only a 35-yard Gerrard smasher was going to change that. The players have been magnificent – we are proud of the way we played." [...] Captain Nigel Reo-Coker found defeat hard to take as he felt they had done enough to win the final: [...] "I can't describe it how I feel at the moment – gutted because I think we deserved to win this game. The players put in a fantastic effort, but it just wasn't to be for us. It was a marvellous FA Cup final and we gave all we could. I hope everyone was proud – it just wasn't our day." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's Just Not That Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety <b>as</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same.
