Interest in developing a northern New Mexico regional airport has periodically surfaced {{for a number of}} years. The New Mexico State Legislature passed a memorial during the 1998 Second Session calling for the conduct of a study to determine the feasibility of building a new regional airport in NNM. This report is a study of the passenger market feasibility of such an airport. In addition to commercial passenger market feasibility, there are other feasibility issues dealing with siting, environmental impact, noise, economic impact, intermodal transportation integration, region-wide transportation services, <b>airport</b> <b>engineering</b> requirements, and others. These other feasibility issues are not analyzed in any depth in this report although none were discovered to be show-stoppers as a by-product of the authors doing research on the passenger market itself. Preceding the need for a detailed study of these other issues is the determination of the basic market need for an airport with regular commercial airline service in the first place.

40|$|Corrosion of airport {{pavements}} is a {{major problem}} involved with materials engineering and transportation <b>engineering.</b> <b>Airport</b> pavements frequently start to deteriorate slowly primarily, gradually progressing to failure. Such failure can be expensive in terms of both money and lives, but can also be prevented. For that reason, intelligent techniques should be suggested, with the intention of examining the condition of such engineering structures. IR thermography and ground penetrating radar are two NDT (non-destructive testing) techniques that have the ability to inspect effectively substantial areas, such as airport pavements. In this work, two different airport pavements located at the International Airport of Athens, in Greece, were investigated by the use of the above two mentioned techniques. Successful detection of cracks, voids and other imperfections appearing either from the aging of the materials or due to poor workmanship was attained. Furthermore, this paper describes the problem of deteriorated airport pavements, shows the process and the apparatus used for the in situ tests, and finally presents results obtained from the investigations...|$|R
40|$|COSMA {{will help}} to improve the {{understanding}} of the effects of aircraft noise near <b>airports,</b> to develop <b>engineering</b> guidelines, methods implementing suitable design, operating practices aimed to minimise the noise annoyance, supported by a set of validated tools. An extensive literature study about annoyance around airports since 1980 was performed. A list of moderator variables that are affecting the annoyance around airports was established {{on the basis of this}} study. The power plant and aircraft definition was given, which is important for the further work in the technical work packages. Telephone and field studies are preparing part for the central annoyance studies in the project. More than 1. 200 telephone interviews were performed to map the status quo of the current aircraft noise annoyance situation around 3 European airports. The field study will provide more detailed information about the current noise annoyance. An interactive Sound Synthesis Machine (SSM) was developed to improve the sound quality of a single aircraft fly-over. Subjects will be able to create their own preferred sounds for different aircraft using this tool. It consists of an on-line Sound Machine (SM) for interactive sound quality analysis and the Airport Noise Climate Synthesizer (ANCS), producing event sequences in real airport scenarios. Significant work was also carried out to improve source component and noise propagation models that are implemented in the ANCS tool. Further work was performed for developing an intelligent Data Reduction and Transformation (iDRT) module. Based on this reduced data a so-called “virtual listener” regression model was developed, predicting the annoyance. For long-term descriptors, a preliminary version of a neural network was developed. Finally, five different airport scenarios for investigation were defined, also the criteria for their optimisation. An interactive tool, to generate a sequence easily and of arbitrary length from the available data base, was written and is already available. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This research into changing organisational forms and the re-shaping of work was prompted by the recognition that, despite an apparent {{increase in the number}} and importance of 'new' organisational forms, their implications for the future of work had yet to be fully explored. Current accepted frameworks for analysing organisations, work and employment tend to be founded upon one of two premises. The first, prevalent in human resources management (HRM), industrial relations, occupational psychology and employment law literature, takes work and employment to be organised and shaped by a single employing organisation, having well-defined boundaries and considerable control over its internal policies. This approach largely ignores the growth of inter-organisational relationships and the permeability of organisational boundaries, even in situations where work is sub-contracted. The second, associated with much organisational analysis, strategic management and industrial economics literature, attends to inter-organisational relationships, but also treats each organisation as an essentially coherent and unitarist entity, capable of displaying entity-wide attitudes and values such as organisational trust. Analysis of the employment relationship and its well-known contested nature is widely disregarded. In a context of increasing fragmentation and permeability of organisations, and evidence that human resources (HR) policies are unable to resolve the potential conflicts and contradictions inherent in the employment relationship, a fresh approach is needed. This departs from methodological traditions focused on the single organisation as the unit of analysis, with data often gathered through the lens of a single respondent, and with a lack of attention to inter-organisational relations. This research built on work in the ESRC Contracts and Competition Programme that has analysed trust between firms (for example, the work of Deakin and Michie), to include a more specific analysis of the role of employment relations. It also extended work that has focused on the employment aspects of specific types of 'new organisational form' - franchising, employment agencies, public sector subcontracting, for example - by developing a broader and more comprehensive analysis. The project was designed to collect data, via in-depth qualitative case studies of inter-organisational networks, on how these new organisational forms operate in practice, and to subject existing literature - particularly that based on speculative and normative theorising - to more critical analysis. The project adopted a case study approach using documentary analysis, in-depth interviews with a range of individuals at different levels of the hierarchy and a limited amount of participant observation. A key feature of the approach was its focus on inter-organisational relations. Main Topics : The researchers adopted a case study approach using documentary analysis, in-depth interviews with a range of individuals at different levels of the hierarchy and a limited amount of participant observation. A key feature of the approach was its focus on inter-organisational relations. This data collection is comprised of interview material from eight case studies. The characteristics of the data for each case are given below: Airport Case: ten key airport organisations and airport-owned departments/subsidiaries at Airport S were selected for the study, including <b>airport</b> security, <b>engineering,</b> fire services, baggage handling services, full handling services, four airlines and a ground cleaning contracting firm. Eighty-eight interviews (88 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives across the range of organisations. Ceramics Case: five ceramics manufacturers were selected for the study. Thirty-eight interviews (36 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives across the five organisations, the employers' organisation and the trade union for the industry. Chemicals Case: this case study focused upon links between a pigment manufacturing plant (Scotchem), one of several UK based chemical production facilities owned by Multichem, a large European multinational that specialises in developing and producing industrial chemicals, and a network of its suppliers. It also draws upon data from customers and suppliers including chemical companies, road haulage firms and a security firm. Forty-seven interviews (42 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives across the range of organisations and with the trade association for the industry. Information Technology Case: this case study involved a large government department which outsourced the development and maintenance of its computer facilities to 'FutureTech', a global software and IT systems development company. Forty-five interviews (49 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives across both organisations. Post Office Counters Ltd Case (POC) : this case study focuses upon POC, one of the three main businesses of Consignia, formerly the Post Office Group, which is a publicly owned company (it has since changed its name again to Royal Mail). Of the three, POC is the only subsidiary, the other two being run as operating divisions. The case study focuses upon Crown Post Offices, which are run and staffed as a public sector organisation as well as branches that are privately owned, either through sub-post office contracts or franchises. Thirty-four interviews (37 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives across the range of organisations. PFI Case: this case study involves a large NHS Trust and a consortium of three private sector organisations which won a PFI (Private Finance Initiative) contract to construct new buildings and deliver estates maintenance, cleaning and catering services. Sixty-seven interviews (57 interviewees) were held with senior and middle managers, employees and union representatives in both the public and private sector organisations. Teacher Supply Case: this case study focuses upon a temporary employment agency that specialises in providing supply teachers for schools. Sixty-three interviews (66 interviewees) were held, drawing upon interviews with managers and employees from two branches of the agency along with supply teachers and representatives from schools in the North West area. Customer Services Case (TCS) : this case study focuses upon TCS, which provides business processing outsourcing services to utilities, private enterprise and the public sector, with a primary focus on customer management outsourcing. Four TCS sites have been explored; TCS Training Service, a subsidiary company specialising in training; a North West call centre and billing centre for National Suppliers companies; a North West call centre offering services for 5 different contracts; and the administration of the housing benefits service for a London Council. The case study has focused particularly on the latter two sites.
