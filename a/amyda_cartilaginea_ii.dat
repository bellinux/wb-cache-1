50|$|Natural predators are predators {{from the}} prey's natural range. Natural predators of <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> are the smooth-coated otter and the tiger. Natural predators of the turtle's eggs are monitor lizards, crows, snakes, eagles, and wild pigs. Non-natural predators of adult Asiatic soft-shells and their eggs are humans. Although {{the most obvious}} threats to <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> are large animals, they can be {{infected}} by many small and microscopic freshwater organisms/parasites. Known species parasitic to <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> are, bacteria: Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas veronii; fungus: Saprolegnia and ectoparasitic worm: Pseudocalceostoma. Larger parasites to this turtle are leeches and nematodes species: Monhysterides jambiensis and Spiroxys sumatraensis.|$|R

50|$|The Asian {{softshell}} turtle, {{otherwise known}} as <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea,</b> {{is made up of}} three main types of species, two of which branch into further subspecies.|$|R
50|$|<b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> {{is key to}} trading {{business}} in the areas it resides in, such as Asia and India. It {{are one of the}} few species harvested where they naturally reside, providing food for the people in the surrounding areas. They are an important food in the Sarawak culture. These areas have a sparse variety of food. However, the exploitation and trade of <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> may be hurting the turtle's population. Millions of Asiatic soft-shells are shipped around these regions every day, causing more to be shipped than what is produced in their habitat. The United States has some regions where these turtles reside, and used to participate in trade of the Asiatic soft-shell as well. However, once this trade was proven to have some danger on the turtle's population, laws were put in place to stop trading <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> in the United States. Later on, other countries began to do this as well.|$|R
5000|$|Amyda cartelgenea has {{different}} ways of communicating. Its snout is used for hunting, smelling predators, and breathing. The Asiatic soft-shell also uses tactile and chemical communication. Its snout is used for hunting, smelling predators, and breathing. This species {{has different}} ways of communicating, which include tactile and chemical communication. [...] <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> has different kinds of perception channels such as visual, tactile, and vibration. It is largely solitary except during breeding. Asiatic soft-shells bury themselves for both protection and hunting; when a threat is perceived, the Asiatic soft-shell has the tendency to become aggressive. It can give off a painful bite, although it usually does not cause significant damage. <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> buries itself under mud to protect itself. It has minimal interaction with humans, and does not bond with them. Therefore, the Asiatic soft-shelled turtle would not make a suitable pet and subsequently has not been domesticated. <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> does not have very good eye sight. Given its habitat (canals, streams, ponds), it has fuzzy vision.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic {{softshell}} turtle or black-rayed softshell turtle (<b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea)</b> is {{a species}} of softshell turtle in the Trionychidae family. It {{is not the only}} softshell turtle in Asia (most trionychines are Asian).|$|R
50|$|Females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{eight to ten}} years, while males reach {{sexual maturity}} at four to five years. <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> is oviparous and builds protective nests at night. The incubation period ranges from 18-20 weeks, {{with the size of}} each clutch ranging from one to 30 eggs. Clutch size is highly dependent on the geographical location {{and the size of the}} turtles. Hatchling sizes range from 32-49, which is also dependent on the size and location of the <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea.</b> The nests of the Asiatic soft-shell are built in damp, sandy areas built close to mud banks; the mother leaves her eggs after building a safe environment for them.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic soft-shell is an omnivore, {{meaning it}} will feed off {{of plants and}} animals when given the chance. It has the ability to stay under water {{for long periods of time}} because of the gill like {{structure}} it possesses. This gives <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> the ability to sneak up on prey. The Asiatic soft-shell likes to eat a variety of foods, including crabs, fish, insects, worms, eggs, amphibians,crustaceans and even at times bird carcasses. When the Asiatic soft-shell can't find meat, it will choose to eat berries, nuts, and plant seeds. <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> specifically prefers the seeds of marsh plants. It also sometimes chooses to munch on rubber tree seeds. As with most animals, as the specific habitat of each turtle changes, its specific diet also slightly changes. The Asiatic soft-shell turtle does most of its hunting and foraging during the night hours.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the trade}} for this species grows, {{the amount of}} turtles {{remaining}} drops. The Asiatic softshell turtle {{is now on the}} IUCN Red List as [...] "Vulnerable", meaning it is not yet extinct, but is at the risk of becoming so. Laws have been put in place to help slow down the trading of these turtles or even stop it completely to protect this species from extinction. However, there aren't any against harvesting <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> for food. Since selling for human consumption is one of biggest markets these turtles are sold in, the laws put in place have made only a slight difference in the Asiatic soft-shell's population drop. Harvesting is done mostly locally, since it allows the turtle's meat to be made freshly, and is quickly available to residents. Trading to other countries is done to provide food, however <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> is also used for medicinal purposes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> has a {{shell that}} grows from 70 to 80 cm (27.6 to 31.5 inches) in length. [...] The {{juvenile}} turtle's shell has a rough appearance; adults have a shell that {{is soft and}} leathery in texture. This turtle is average sized, growing to weigh between 15 kg (33 lbs) and 25 kg (55 lbs), [...] with unconfirmed reports claiming that <b>Amyda</b> <b>Cartilaginea</b> can grow to be as heavy as 105 kg (231 lbs). [...] Its carapace is oval in shape; on adult turtles its color ranges from a soft olive to green-brown. On juveniles, the carapace is dark brown or black, however this color fades with age. Yellow dots, and the occasional black spot, {{can be found on}} the shell, but these too fade as the turtle gets older. Its plastron is sexually dimorphic, appearing white in males and gray in females.|$|R
5000|$|The head of <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> can {{be black}} or brown. Its head {{typically}} displays yellow dots that sometimes appear to fuse together, creating elongated streaks. As the turtle ages, its nape region becomes white or gray. [...] A trait that helps differentiate the Asiatic soft-shell turtle from other similar species is its noticeably elongated snout. This is an adaptation that, coupled with its great flexibility, aids the turtle in breathing {{when it has}} buried itself. [...] Increased gas exchange, {{a result of an}} adaptation known as [...] "pharyngel breathing", allows the Asiatic soft-shell turtle to remain submerged in water for extended periods of time. [...] <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> has several permanent tubercles on its neck; [...] these tubercles can appear yellow or black. The Asiatic soft-shell turtle's limbs also have yellow spots, but these are usually less in quantity and difficult to distinguish. Its feet are wide and flat, resembling paddles. As a final descriptive note, the males have longer and thicker tails than females.|$|R
50|$|<b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> is polygynangrous, meaning each female {{mates with}} several {{different}} males and males mate with several different females. The mating season is during the hot-dry season, which lasts from April to September. However, this may vary {{based on the}} specific geographic location of each turtle. Copulation happens underwater with the male using its claws to hold the upper shell of the female. Breeding typically occurs {{three to four times}} per year.|$|R
50|$|The Asiatic {{softshell}} turtle {{is found}} in wetlands and rivers, mostly {{in different parts of}} Asia. In this region, they are exploited for trade and harvested for food. With business developing that rely on the exploitation of <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea,</b> the population of this species has declined. There is more worry now than ever about the danger of the Asiatic soft-shell's exploitation. In fact, it is hard to say exactly how much longer this species will be around.|$|R

50|$|The Asiatic soft shelled turtle {{goes through}} a life cycle similar to many other turtles around the world. It begins its life by {{hatching}} from a clutch of eggs laid in sand along a body of water. This clutch can {{range in size from}} four to eight eggs depending on the size and age of the female that laid the clutch. On average, the incubation period for <b>Amyda</b> <b>cartilaginea</b> ranges between 130 and 140 days. However, the incubation period is greatly dependent on climate; not only for the rate of incubation, but also the sex of the majority of these turtles. Temperature has a great influence on what sex the turtle will become, females are typically born at around 30 degrees Celsius and males at 25 degrees Celsius. Once hatched, these young turtles must race to the water in order to prevent being eaten. Monitor lizards along with crows and serpent eagles are known to eat these young turtles.|$|R

All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, {{but there is a}} national harvest and export quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the quota allocated by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1. 2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the national quota of 50, 000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD / year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005 – 6) was estimated at around 300, 000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30, 000 from Sumatra, exceeding the national quota of 200, 000 individuals / year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD / year.
