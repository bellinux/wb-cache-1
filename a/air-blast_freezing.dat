40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} freezing and thawing methods on the physicochemical indices and nutritive value of edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] were investigated. <b>Air-blast</b> <b>freezing</b> had {{less of an}} impact on the drip loss, color, chlorophyll and ascorbic acid contents, and textural hardness of frozen shelled edamames. Ultrasound-assisted thawing significantly (p< 0. 05) shortened thawing time, compared to water immersion thawing. Ultrasound-assisted thawing at a 900 W power level showed the best retention of ascorbic acid and chlorophyll, and original hardness, and minimized the drip loss of thawed samples. Ultrasonic assisted thawing at a power level of 1, 200 W caused the most pronounced loss of ascorbic acid. A combination of fast <b>air-blast</b> <b>freezing</b> and ultrasound-assisted thawing at a power level of 900 W most effectively retained ascorbic acid and chlorophyll, minimized drip loss, and maintained the textural hardness of shelled edamame samples...|$|E
40|$|Gutted Atlantic cod, {{packed in}} cartons, were frozen {{immediately}} after killing in {{a magnetic field}} (cell alive system). The results were compared with traditional <b>air-blast</b> <b>freezing</b> or by putting the cartons directly in a cold storage room (without forced convection of air). After frozen storage, external and fillet properties were compared. In spite of differences in freezing rates, only minor differences were found among treatments. The mechanism for the freezing of fish in the magnetic field, under the current conditions, appeared {{to be similar to}} that of traditional freezing method...|$|E
40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} processors, {{faced with the}} challenge of gaining and maintaining a healthy position in the competitive fruit {{and vegetable}} sector, are optimising traditional processes towards product quality. Using frozen potatoes as a case study, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential of improving the texture of potatoes by modifying the processing conditions. The texture of processed frozen potatoes is the result of the integral effect of the unit operations applied through the production chain. Production of frozen potatoes includes a blanching, a freezing, thawing/cooking step before being served. In this study, blanching temperatures from 70 to 97 °C up to 10 minutes were tested and combined with freezing by two freezing methods, impingement and <b>air-blast</b> <b>freezing.</b> The texture was measured after cooking of frozen potatoes in boiling water. Besides texture, water holding capacity, microstructural evaluation and pectinmethylesterase (PME) activity were determined. Blanching of potatoes prior to freezing can both improve water holding capacity and texture of potatoes, but this effect depends on the freezing rate and blanching temperature. Potatoes frozen with fastest freezing method are firmer and hold more water than the ones frozen by <b>air-blast</b> <b>freezing.</b> Blanching at 70 °C can lead to potatoes that after cooking retain a firmer texture, compared with blanching at 90 °C. The duration of the blanching treatment has also an important effect on texture changes. The studies of PME activity showed a good correlation between texture and PME for blanching at 90 °C, but for blanching at 70 °C and longer times, the development of texture does not seem to be solely related to PME activity. Microstructural studies showed that the differences in texture are due to differences in the degree of starch gelatinisation and integrity of the cellular structure...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the earlier}} 2000 s, {{electromagnetic}} freezers {{have been sold}} all over the world. According to the manufacturers, the oscillating magnetic fields (OMFs) applied by these devices are capable of avoiding ice damage in frozen foods. To assess the effectiveness of OMFs in preserving food quality, we froze crab sticks in a commercial electromagnetic freezer, both with (< 2 mT, 6 - 59 Hz) and without OMF application. Crab sticks were also frozen in a conventional freezer, both with static- and forced-air conditions, to compare electromagnetic freezing with conventional methods. After 24 h and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of storage, {{we did not find}} any effect of the OMFs on the drip loss, water-holding capacity, toughness, and whiteness of the crab sticks frozen in the electromagnetic device. Moreover, no advantage of electromagnetic freezing over <b>air-blast</b> <b>freezing</b> was detected at the conditions tested. More experiments at larger magnetic field strength and wider frequency ranges are needed to have a complete view of the potential effects of OMFs on food freezing.
