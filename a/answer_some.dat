5|$|Another {{one of the}} men {{gave the}} {{surprising}} testimony that Lieutenant Commander Coakley had threatened to have him shot after he refused to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> questions during interrogation at Camp Shoemaker. Seaman Alphonso McPherson held fast to his testimony even when faced by Coakley in cross-examination. Coakley denied threatening anyone, exclaiming that such an idea was a personal affront. Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E

Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced questions about whether those players would perform better with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> of the questions about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against Middle Tennessee State.|$|E

5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy <b>answer.</b> <b>Some</b> critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|Logan {{comes over}} for dinner at Veronica’s house, and Keith becomes {{increasingly}} annoyed when Logan refuses to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> questions. Veronica goes into Parker Lee's (Julie Gonzalo) room, where Veronica reveals that she was raped as well. A journalist interviews Parker, while Logan discusses finances with his accountant. Logan asks Veronica for help in searching through records {{in an attempt to}} catch the accountant. Meanwhile, a woman asks Keith to investigate her husband, who may be having an affair. Wallace informs Veronica that there was a Pi Sigma fraternity party the night of every rape. Later, Dick (Ryan Hansen) asks Veronica to prove that the fraternity is innocent, and Veronica agrees just to infiltrate the fraternity. Keith sees the husband getting into a car with several other women. He contacts Harmony, the woman, and presents the evidence.|$|E

25|$|In 1927, Ranjitsinhji {{came under}} attack from the All India States Peoples Conference which accused him, among other things, of being an {{absentee}} ruler, high taxes and restricting liberties. He responded through supporting published works by different authors, including Jamnagar and its Ruler in 1927, Nawanagar and its Critics in 1929 and The Land of Ranji and Duleep in 1931. Although not entirely accurate, they attempted to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> of the criticisms. Ranjitsinhji visited England in 1930, {{to take part in}} talks on India's constitution. While there, he was well received by former cricketers and saw Duleepsinhji score 174 against Australia in a Test match at Lord's. At the request of Sussex, he was president of the county for the year. He continued to oppose Indian federation, despite support for the idea from the British and some of the princes. He was chancellor to the Chamber of Princes in 1933, shortly before he died.|$|E

They lost 2–0 with goals from Capucho and Jardel, and the title-holders reduced Benfica's league lead to one point. In João Marcelino view, [...] "The game between Porto and Benfica had to {{forcibly}} <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> questions — {{and it did not}} disappoint expectations. The easy win by Fernando Santos' team clearly showed who still is, almost six years later, the best team in domestic football; and the way that Jupp Heynckes accepted defeat could be used as evidence that he has been pushing his players to their current limit." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{scientists}} at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as [...] "Project Ichiban" [...] {{in order to}} <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> of the unanswered questions, but it failed to clear up all the issues. In 1982, Los Alamos created a replica Little Boy from the original drawings and specifications. This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion. A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile, and experiments were run to assess neutron emission. Based on this and the data from The Great Artiste, the yield was estimated at 16.6 ± 0.3 kilotons. After considering many estimation methods, a 1985 report concluded that the yield was 15 kilotons ± 20%.|$|E
500|$|Griffin {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} his performance, saying [...] "people who have always been against the BNP will say that I couldn't <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> things." [...] He was {{of the opinion that}} he had been shown [...] "extraordinary hostility" [...] by the main political parties, but that he was happy having done his best. Griffin said: [...] "I can see that millions of people who don't usually watch Question Time will remember what I've said and think that's how they feel and I'm perfectly happy with that." [...] He also said he expected the BNP would appear on Question Time again. The BNP legal officer, Lee Barnes, described Griffin's performance as [...] "failing to press the attack", and the Evening Standard reported a possible challenge to Griffin's leadership from a faction within the BNP, linked to Chris Jackson, which was dissatisfied with his performance, but rated this chance of success as low.|$|E
500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> of these questions, and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly Dalton Ross {{named the}} episode {{as one of}} the season's best, commending the fact that [...] "most of the main {{questions}} were actually answered," [...] unlike the season finale of Lost. He praised the Bree storyline as well as the conclusion to the Mary Alice mystery, calling it [...] "both shocking and satisfying." [...] Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC also compared the episode to the Lost season finale, writing: [...] "'Desperate Housewives' is willing to <b>answer</b> <b>some</b> of its mysterious questions and give readers a little bit of closure. 'Lost,' heading into its own two-hour finale this Wednesday, is still dangling a dozen carrots in front of impatient viewers." [...] Cooper felt that the episode was a satisfying conclusion to the season opining that [...] "by allowing some of its plots to remain tantalizing mysteries, yet offering up the satisfaction of explaining others, 'Desperate Housewives' has smartly set things up for its audience to return for its new season next fall." [...] Frazier Moore of USA Today called the finale [...] "a smashing close" [...] to the first season. Moore expressed interest in how the cliffhangers would be resolved, {{as well as in the}} Betty Applewhite character. He also theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: [...] "Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body.
