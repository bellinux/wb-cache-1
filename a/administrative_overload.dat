METHODS: Qualitative research with Alfred Schütz's social phenomenology approach. The participants were nine female nurses who worked at public and private hospitals in Montevideo, Uruguay. RESULTS: The nurses experience the gap between theory and practice, <b>administrative</b> <b>overload,</b> insecurity to take over care management and pursuit of formal and informal knowledge; they show desires and specific definitions, autonomy and professional identity, and professional valuation. CONCLUSION: The nurses perceive their professional activity as having a gap between theory and practice, <b>administrative</b> <b>overload,</b> insecurity to take over care management and pursuit of formal and informal knowledge, with expectations and desires of recovery and definitions of specific duties, autonomy and professional identity.

The scenery {{of the study were}} six units of family health located in one of the five Sanitary Districts of João Pessoa-PB. The data collection was performed from August to September 2010, through semi directed interviews, in which ten professionals who worked as matricial supporters participated. According to the speeches the difficulties faced relate to the ignorance of some professionals of the health team toward the function of the matricial supporter in the Basic Health Attention; lack of autonomy and <b>administrative</b> <b>overload.</b> In this sense, it is suggested that a process of reflection about the work of the matricial supporter with the health team aiming to acknowledge which contribution of this professional in the reorganization of the work of the team of basic attention...|$|E

Specifically, that (1) increasingly firms of all sizes will have access to high performance computing capabilities that will enable sophisticated modeling and simulation, (2) additive manufacturing will become commercially competitive across a wide range of industry sectors and will support the use of multiple materials, and (3) new business models that rely on IT will reduce the <b>administrative</b> <b>overload</b> of bidding, winning and delivering products and services. Together these combine to favor localization of manufacturing rather than today’s more centralized, economies-of-scale production models.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify occupational stressors for professional nurses in South Africa. A cross-sectional survey design was used. A stratified random sample of professional nurses (n= 818; females[*]=[*] 97 %) in hospitals in South Africa was used. The Nursing Stress Indicator (NSI) was administrated together with a biographical questionnaire. Three internally consistent stress factors, namely lack of organisational support, job demands and nursing-specific demands, were extracted. The most severe stressors for professional nurses included staff shortages, inadequate salaries and excessive <b>administrative</b> duties. Work <b>overload,</b> fellow workers not doing their job, health risks posed by contact with patients and demands of patients were also identified as stressors. Stress was associated with specific factors, including age, position (rank), care unit, and work experience. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effect of emotions on teachers’ {{ability to cope with}} educational change and what factors help or hinder their ability to change their practice. Using an ethnomethodological approach, how one group of Hong Kong Secondary English teachers were able {{to make sense of the}} first School Based Assessment (SBA) initiative, part of the greater Hong Kong educational reform project, and apply it to their daily teaching practice is explored. The group of teachers is comprised of five Form Four teachers including the researcher. Being a participant-member, the researcher was able to have total access to the study environment and close daily contact with the other participants in the study. Interview data was taken at three intervals, one at the end of the first year of the initial implementation, another upon the completion of the first SBA cohort and then again at the end of the first Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) at which point the original form of the SBA had been conducted six times. Findings show that teachers’ emotions play a very important role in their working lives and are often sublimated to be able to cope with the competing and sometimes conflicting demands of school and society. This emotional management is very difficult to maintain and teachers must find creative ways of coping to lessen its effects, in particular, by a form of emotional banking in which teachers tap into good teaching memories to alleviate feelings of being overwhelmed or inadequate in the face of change. Other findings demonstrate that teachers’ ability to change their practice was greatly restricted by systemic factors beyond their control. While the largescale reform effort seeks to transform Hong Kong’s education system to be more ‘flexible, diversified and integrated’ and increase teachers’ professionalism, the reality is that society clings to the belief that only the high-stakes examinations have value. This factor, coupled with an <b>overloaded</b> <b>administrative</b> workload has made real teacher development and growth in professional practice virtually nonexistent. published_or_final_versionEducationDoctoralDoctor of Educatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Research in General Practice {{requires}} {{the participation of}} General practitioners (GPs). In Germany there is little tradition of research in this field, and GPs {{are not used to}} be participants in research. Little is known about German GPs attitudes towards research. Therefore the aim of our study was to assess the willingness of German General Practitioners to participate in primary care research and their attitude towards research in general practice. The results should enable a more successful approach to GPs in further studies. Methods Cross sectional study using semi-structured interviews with a random sample of 76 General Practitioners who participate in the teaching of medical students at the University of Heidelberg. Results Despite little experience, over 85 % of GPs appreciated research in their field. Important reasons for scepticism about research were the gap between theoretical research and practical work of GPs and the domination of research by specialists. Main barriers for participation are clinical workload, <b>administrative</b> <b>overload</b> and the newly introduced Disease Management Programs. The highest motivation for GPs to participate in research emanates from the will to substantiate their quality of care with solid research data. Conclusions Financial incentives and personal support e. g. with study nurses are certainly necessary to establish a research culture and to overcome main barriers against participation. The most successful approach to motivate GPs to participate is to convince them that research documents their quality of care. This data may reflect the facts on which the financial resources are provided in the future health care system. </p...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{complexity}} {{regarding a}} principal's role and associated leadership tasks, combined with changing societal realms and educational reform pose serious challenges {{to even the}} most experienced educational leaders. For new school leaders, taking on the principalship within a given organizational context is predicated on the notion that learning the role is a continual process of "being and becoming. " This research inquires into the nature of early-phase leadership and strives to understand the phenomenon of the beginning principalship by examining roles, agency and practices of new leaders as influenced by their preparation and induction support. Given that school leaders impact the performance of organizational members and that new principals are required to perform the same job as their experienced counterparts, in order to identify ways {{to meet the needs of}} individuals transitioning into the position, it is important to understand new principals' experiences. This qualitative phenomenological study used semi-structured interviews to investigate perceptions and experiences of sixteen newly appointed and one-year experienced principals from two separate school boards in the following areas: preparation and induction experiences, developing relationships and building trust with colleagues, as well as how newcomers enacted their roles, utilized their agency and exercised their emerging leadership practice. Evidence substantiates that beginning principals experienced role-identity transition in adjusting to the nature and demands of new leadership, including <b>administrative</b> <b>overload,</b> and challenges associated with organizational dynamics and external influences. New leaders developed compensatory strategies and immediately acted to acquire organizational information and improve conditions for teaching and learning. The investigation found that beginning principals employed engagement processes and attended to "three dimensional" trust criteria to develop relationships and build trust. In addition, although new principals valued the use of cohorts, real-time training and mentoring, they missed receiving formal support during the transition time frame referred to as the "crossover gap.

40|$|Summary - {{document}} has {{no additional}} text]. What happens when member {{states do not}} comply with EU law? To answer this question, {{the role of the}} EU Commission as guardian of the treaties demands particular attention, especially the instruments it may employ, and the enforcement policy it actually pursues, against member states that violate binding EU rules. Our qualitative data on how fifteen member states have transposed a sample of six EU social policy Directives allows us to confront the Commission’s enforcement policy with the "real" amount of domestic transposition failures. We thus challenge the approach taken by much of the existing literature, which looks {{at the tip of the}} iceberg only by restricting itself to the analysis of available data on EU infringement procedures. This allows us to reject or validate some of the most dominant assumptions in this literature about the logics of Commission enforcement policy. We show that enforcement often does not take place at all or does not take place in a consistent manner when compared to the Commission’s own rules. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Commission heavily focuses on non-notification rather than on incorrect transposition. One of the explanations is that infringement procedures are constrained by the length and complexity of the Commision’s internal procedures. Although our data suggest significant diversity in the treatment of different member states, we argue that this is not the result of political favouritism but of the necessity to prioritise some cases over others under the conditions of <b>administrative</b> <b>overload.</b> Our sample shows that these prioritisations often follow different Directives. It seems that the choice is made largely by the responsible unit and depends on its workload, the complexity of the Directive, and the overall importance attached to the respective policy. Furthermore, we show that neither the general level of labour law protection, nor the level of misfit with pre-existing national policies, nor opposition during the negotiations determine the Commission’s enforcement policy – even though the last factor does have some influence. Finally, we discuss kick-start, acceleration and correction as different effects that infringement procedures had in the implementation processes under scrutiny. Overall we conclude that infringement proceedings as they are practised today are a rather inadequate instrument for assuring compliance, even though the situation would be even worse if there were none at all...|$|E
40|$|As is {{the case}} {{elsewhere}} in the world, all stakeholders in South Africa are deeply concerned about the level and scope of underachievement in mathematics, not only at Grade 12 level, but, indeed, at University, University of Technology and Further Education and Training levels. These concerns assume a deeper dimension {{in light of the}} fact that inadequate achievement in mathematics inevitably will have a ripple effect on the academic situation in any country: inadequate achievement in mathematics precludes learners from applying for admission to sought-after ﬁ elds of study, which, in turn, prevents numerous learners from realising their true potential and, eventually, from being happy and successful in careers that they might otherwise have been able to execute successfully. It goes without saying that inadequate achievement in mathematics will impact negatively on the overall economic situation in any country (even more so in a developing country such as South Africa). Truth being, achievement in mathematics amounts to equipping oneself with survival skills. In this article, the spotlight shifts from a narrow and outdated focus on problems that are associated with inadequate achievement in mathematics to possible solutions for this disconcerting situation and the implied challenge it raises. The focus is thus on three levels that collectively underpin and impact on achievement in mathematics, viz. the macro level, the meso level and the micro level. The macro level refers mainly to the input by the national government (and, by default, the National Department of Education). In the ﬁ rst instance, it is the responsibility of the state to provide adequate schooling facilities for all learners, irrespective of where they ﬁ nd themselves. Furthermore, it is the duty of the state to ensure that every learner has access to basic facilities, including food, water, sanitation and housing. The state (via the National Department of Education) is also obliged to ensure that the basic philosophy that underpins mathematics education in the country is scrutinised continuously and that changes be made to existing teaching philosophy should these be recommended by the majority of stakeholders. Case in point: the implementation of Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) in South African mathematics classrooms has now already been under the spotlight for a number of years and there seems to be general consensus that it is essential to facilitate a number of basic changes to this philosophy and (especially) to the way in which it is implemented in South African classrooms. Teachers, for instance, constantly complain about matters such as an <b>administrative</b> <b>overload,</b> unacceptably high stress levels (brought about by factors broadly associated with OBE-related issues) and the fact that the laudable philosophy underpinning OBE is not consistently realised in practice. At the meso level, the spotlight falls on factors related to teacher training. For example, it seems highly advisable to optimise teacher training in mathematics, to facilitate training in emotional intelligence, to conduct a national audit on the number of mathematics teachers currently teaching mathematics (in terms of how many teachers are currently in the system, where these teachers ﬁ nd themselves, their level of training, etc.) to determine training needs in mathematics and to facilitate a more equitable distribution of teachers across the country. For example, it is proposed that all graduating teachers be compelled to do community service in an effort to facilitate a better understanding of the challenges that teachers in various parts of the country face, thereby breaking down barriers between people. At micro level, the emphasis is on measures that might be taken to provide guidance to parents on how to assist their children in mathematics on the one hand and on practical ways in which to help learners in mathematics perform better in mathematics and leave school better equipped to deal with typical challenges at tertiary level on the other. It is hoped that this article will contribute to an improvement in the disconcerting situation to be found in mathematics classrooms across South Africa. I sincerely hope to have sensitised readers to the need not only to talk about the situation in mathematics in South Africa, but instead to start acting and in so doing to impact on the situation in practical ways. </p...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{well-established}} {{line of thinking}} on strategy and structure in the MNE, beginning with John Stopford's doctoral thesis work (Stopford and Wells, 1972) and moving through the work of Egelhoff (1982), Daniels Pitts and Tretter (1984) and others to Ghoshal and Nohria (1993). However, since the early 1990 s this line of research has almost dried up. There continue to be occasional studies of strategy and structure in the MNE (e. g. Wolf and Egelhoff, 2001), {{but for the most}} part MNE research has moved on to other issues, such as the changing roles of foreign subsidiaries, knowledge flows in the MNE, and studies of the evolution of the MNE. This paper argues that we need to revisit issues of strategy and structure in the MNE, but rather than focusing on the classic contingency factors such as number and diversity of countries, we need to start looking more broadly at other dimensions around which MNEs are now structuring their activities. The main structural dimensions of the 1970 s and 1980 s were countries, business units, and functions. Today we can identify a number of other dimensions that appear to be equally valid. One is the global account structure for customers who expect to be supplied in a coordinated and consistent way across multiple countries and business lines. A second is the industry sector structure, commonly seen in professional services firms, for servicing a set of customers in a focused and knowledgeable way. And a third is the solutions-based structure in which the customer-facing unit pulls together the offerings of various business units and third parties to provide greater value-added for the customer. We will discuss each of these types of structure in detail, looking at the reasons why it has emerged, how it works, and its costs and benefits. We will also address the broader question of why the emphasis in MNE structures has shifted over the last decade towards these customer-focused designs. The primary reason, we argue, is that the opportunities for growth and increased profitability are shifting downstream, towards the provision of value-added services and solutions for customers. Many large MNEs have undertaken this shift in emphasis, including GE, ABB, Ford and Unilever, and while some have failed, others have made the transition very effectively and have been rewarded with superior margins. This broad shift in emphasis has two important consequences, both of which will be discussed in some detail. The first is the risk of creating an organization structure that becomes so complex it is unworkable. Often these new dimensions of structure - global accounts, industry sectors - are placed on top of the existing organization structure, resulting in a four- or five-dimensional matrix. This creates complexity, blurring of roles, and <b>administrative</b> <b>overload.</b> As a result, many MNEs are experimenting with ways of simplifying their structures - they are looking for ways of reducing their portfolio of businesses, outsourcing major activities, and making use of market-like mechanisms for structuring internal relationships. The second consequence is the potential decline in the importance of geography as a design variable. Many MNEs almost completely disregard the traditional country unit of operation (particularly in the developed world), as other structural dimensions become more important. Our belief is that there are major risks in going this route, and we will examine some of the approaches MNEs are using to counteract this tendency. This paper is in four parts. First, we undertake a brief review of the literature on strategy and structure in the MNE. Next we look at the various factors that are driving MNEs to shift their emphasis towards customer-focused structures, and we identify some of the common themes that are emerging. Third, we put forward an organising framework to categorise and explain the different approaches MNEs are adopting. We will present a number of case studies in this section to illustrate how the emerging structures work in practice. Finally, we will revisit some of the broader themes and offer some concluding comments...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Electoral Commissioner has {{abruptly}} {{changed a}} long-standing policy, potentially preventing {{tens of thousands}} of Australians exercising their right to vote at federal elections, according to Brian Costar and Peter Browne SOMETHING puzzling has happened at the Australian Electoral Commission over the past year. In March 2005, when it made its first submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the 2004 federal election, the AEC expressed no concern whatsoever about the workload it faces at each election, when voters are given seven days’ grace to enrol or to update their enrolment. Nor did it express its support for the argument that the last minute rush of enrolments creates opportunities for electoral fraud. Although several members of the parliamentary committee repeatedly returned to the issue, they failed to convince the AEC to support the closure of the electoral roll as soon as the prime minister calls an election. Almost exactly a year later, appearing before a Senate committee earlier this week, the recently appointed Australian Electoral Commissioner, Ian Campbell, expressed almost exactly the opposite view. The committee is inquiring into the innocuously titled Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Electoral Integrity and Other Measures) Bill, which proposes to abolish the period of grace and - if history is any guide - prevent perhaps 300, 000 otherwise eligible people from voting at the next federal election. The committee reported on 28 March and a majority of members supported the early closure of the rolls. This new attitude from the AEC is not only a departure from its thinking a year ago. It is at odds with the commission’s longstanding view that last minute enrolments constitute neither an <b>administrative</b> <b>overload</b> nor a source of fraud. In its submission to the 2000 parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of the electoral roll, for example, the AEC said that “early close of the rolls will not improve the accuracy of the rolls for an election In fact, the expectation is that the rolls for the election will be less accurate, because less time will be available for existing electors to correct their enrolments and for new enrolments to be received. ” In a direct criticism of what the government now proposes, the AEC added: “This expected outcome is in direct conflict with the stated policy intention of the Government to improve the accuracy of the rolls. Further, it will undoubtedly {{have a negative impact on}} the franchise, an outcome which the AEC cannot support. ” The period of grace is a longstanding feature of our electoral system, formalised in law by parliament in 1983. Over the period since 1940 the average gap between the calling of the election and the closing of the rolls has been over 19 days - with no demonstrable impact on the quality of the roll. Indeed, a comprehensive review of the roll by the Australian National Audit Office in 2002 concluded that “overall, the Australian electoral roll is one of high integrity, and can be relied on for electoral purposes”. What’s changed over the past year? Government policy certainly has. In a few short months Senator Eric Abtez, until recently the Special Minister of State, took the often-repeated but never substantiated allegation about fraud and turned it into legislation, which he rushed into parliament just before it rose at the end of 2005. The decision to send the Bill - which also disenfranchises all prisoners and relaxes the disclosure laws for political donations - to a Senate committee suggests that the government realises this is a poorly drafted piece of legislation. The inquiry creates an opportunity to reconsider the sweeping change it would bring to the democratic franchise in Australia. And it is also a good time for the new Electoral Commissioner to explain why he has reversed a longstanding and deeply held view at the AEC. Appearing before the Senate committee this week the Commissioner wasn’t terribly illuminating on this point. He said that early roll closure would mean less work for the AEC after the issue of the writs, which will “make our life easier” and “give us time to concentrate on the other issues we have to deal with in the preparation for the election”. But making life easier for the AEC comes with costs: an incomplete roll on polling day and the effective disenfranchisement of {{tens of thousands of}} otherwise qualified citizens. In the seven days after the writ was issued for the 2004 election 78, 000 persons enrolled for the first time and 345, 000 updated their details; after the seven day period, a further 150 000 tried to enrol. Under the proposed law all of the 78, 000 will be excluded from voting, as will an indeterminate percentage of the 345, 000, while the large number attempting to enrol late suggests that the period of grace should be extended not shortened. If the proponents of any early closure of the roles are correct when they say that a delay between the calling of an election and the close of the roll is an opportunity for widespread enrolment fraud, then Australia has had only one ‘clean’ election since the second world war - in 1983, when the roll did close on the day the prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, called his ill-fated snap election. • Brian Costar is professor of parliamentary democracy at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, and gave evidence to the Senate Inquiry into the Electoral Amendment Bill 2005.
