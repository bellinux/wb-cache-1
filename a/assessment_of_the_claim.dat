40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the debate on the alleged "death" of social class in two ways. First, it critically examines the theoretical arguments that link the globalisation process to changes in patterns of social inequality and class decomposition in advanced Oecd countries. Second, it provides an empirical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> of the death of social class for various dimensions of inequality and for a large number of Eu countries. More precisely, this articles focuses on class-based inequalities in self-assessed health, educational attainment, social mobility, risk of unemployment and of having a temporary contract, and on class effects on a non-traditional political behaviour such as political consumerism. The empirical analysis is based on data drawn from the European Social Survey and a recent comparative project on social mobility. The results consistently show that social class is still a powerful factor that affects individual life chances and consumption behaviour. The main conclusion of the article is that the claim that social classes are useless in interpreting patterns of inequality in advanced societies is largely exaggerated...|$|E

We are responsible for any errors or omissions. Quality of childhood schooling is increasingly seen as important for life chances, because adults’ success in the labour market is closely linked to early educational attainments. However, economic and educational research has had little success in finding resource-based interventions that are effective in rising school standards. Government policy in England currently favours policies based on incentives, governance and competition, and in particular the expansion of the faith-schools sector – largely because it is believed that faith (church) schools offer higher educational standards. The issue has received considerable empirical attention in the US, but <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> is difficult because of selection of pupils into faith schools according to family characteristics that are correlated with pupil achievement. We control for selection on religious schooling by tracking pupils over time and comparing attainments of pupils who exhibit different levels of commitment to religious schooling and residential choices. In particular, we ask whether the faster growth in attainments between ages 7 and 11 for pupils attending church primary schools is really a school-quality effect or whether it is a characteristic of pupils from families who display religious commitment in other ways – e. g. by their choice of secondary school or choice of residence. Our results suggest that, once family preferences and selection into religious education are controlled for, faith schools have a fairly small effect on pupil educational progression in primary school – this effect being between zero and under one-percentile on test scores at the age 11, relative to scores at age 7. - 3 - 1...|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{investigates the}} lives of {{unmarried}} women, who are expecting a child. The aim is to uncover what challenges these women faced, in society during the early 1900 s, on multiple levels. The inspiration of this study originates from the criminal acts, and the subsequent trial, of Dagmar Overby. Dagmar Overby {{is one of the}} most prolific serial killers in Danish history, the victims of her crimes were newborns whom she had taken into foster care. In 1921, she was convicted for the murders of eight children, during her trial a lot of critical claims arose. Her defender, Gottlieb Jacobsen, claimed that careless mothers and an inadequate society were partly to blame. Earlier studies within this field, have mainly focused on describing the life of Dagmar Overby and the subsequent trial. This study investigates Jacobsen’s claim, compared to what is known about the life of unmarried mothers during the period of 1900 - 1950. Through analysis of the circumstances of these women’s lives, and decisions the women made, the study takes a critical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim.</b> The study analyses {{the lives of}} unmarried women through themes such as economy, social life and laws. All of these themes are considered to be issues, which could force the unmarried mothers to kill their newborn or place them in foster care. The study investigates the lives of these women partly through original archive material from the trial, old newspaper articles, and through literature about women and child laws. The analysis of this material has led to the conclusion, that unmarried mothers faced plenty of obstacles, including: financial limitations, the risk of public humiliation, and laws that limited and stigmatised their way of life severely. All of these circumstances are considered to have influenced why some women chose to kill their newborn or place them in foster care...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis contains three {{essays on the}} macroeconomic impact of inflation targeting: (1) Inflation-targeting regime, {{as a framework for}} monetary policy conduct, has been adopted by central banks in thirty countries. Some of these countries enjoy high incomes while others have middle incomes. In contrast to the development-based classification –often applied in the literature, thus ignoring income disparity– this study employs income-based classification in constructing the data sample. The objective is to investigate, using a panel of middle-income countries, whether inflation targeting is a good remedy for high inflation. In addition to the commonly used covariates in the literature, this study also includes in its covariate matrix the worldwide governance indicators as proxy for institutional quality. The findings exhibit a significant reduction of inflation and its volatility among the inflation-targeting adopters compared to the non-adopting middle-income countries. The results are robust to the exclusion of high inflation episodes, and to using the alternative measures of inflation. The results are also robust to the post-estimation sensitivity tests recommended for such empirical analysis. (2) Many economists acknowledge the paramount role that foreign investment plays in fostering economic development and growth via integrating economies around the globe. Studies have shown that foreign investment, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI) is attracted to countries that exhibit good governance, low uncertainty and a high degree of macroeconomic stability. The literature also argues that monetary policy under inflation targeting (IT) mitigates uncertainty, enhances governance and brings macroeconomic stability to the adopting countries. Hence, {{it would seem that the}} IT-adoption should enable the adopting countries attract the largest FDI inflows. To verify this conjecture, this study performs a comparison between the IT-adopting countries and the non-adopters in attracting FDI. Using a panel of OECD and middle-income countries, the empirical findings exhibit an interesting but contradicting pattern: when it comes to the OECD countries, the results show that the IT-adopters do better than the non-adopters in attracting the FDI inflows. For the middle-income countries, however, the IT-adoption appears to have the opposite effect: a significant reduction in the FDI inflows is witnessed among the IT-adopters compared to their counterparts. The results are robust to the post-estimation sensitivity tests. (3) Inflation targeting, as a monetary-policy framework, is said to promote economic efficiency and growth. Yet, when evaluating the macroeconomic performance of inflation-targeting regimes, the existing literature only emphasizes the dynamics of inflation and the costs associated with taming inflation. There is hardly any <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> of efficiency and growth. To fill this gap, and to measure the causal impact of inflation-targeting adoption on economic efficiency, we compare the dynamics of output growth and long-term unemployment between countries that have adopted inflation targeting and the non-adopting countries. Our findings seem to refute the efficiency claim, and paint a bleak picture of inflation targeting: when compared to the countries that did not adopt inflation targeting, there is a significant reduction in the average growth rate among the inflation-targeting adopters by over ½ percentage point. Additionally, long-term unemployment significantly rises among the inflation-targeting countries by almost 2 percentage points as compared to the non-adopters. These results are robust to both the exclusion of the outlier observations and to the sensitivity tests recommended for such analysis...|$|E

40|$|As {{commonly}} known, {{to evaluate}} <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve (otherwise {{known as the}} provision for outstanding <b>claims),</b> <b>the</b> loss adjuster uses as a first component <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve given by <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estimated provision for each outstanding claim (known as case reserve). Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve. In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> these traditional methods due to <b>the</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data available for evaluations. This paper presents <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve. <b>The</b> proposed methodology reduces the loss adjuster’s discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve. Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences. In particular, a calculation method is presented that using the different assumptions describing <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> different <b>claim</b> handling procedures (Non-Card, Card, Handler Forfait and Debtor Forfait) is able to quantify <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> reserve.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{business}} <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to examine whether organizations ‘evolve’. In every-day language, it is easy enough to say that they do, but supplying a theoretical account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> this so-called ‘evolution’ is far from straight forward. Does it, for instance, commit one to a tour through <b>the</b> science <b>of</b> biology and <b>the</b> Darwinian theory <b>of</b> natural selection? <b>The</b> programme <b>of</b> research entitled ‘Generalized Darwinism’ asks of organizational theorists that they make such a commitment. Its proponents have recently explained their reasoning in the journals Organization Studies and Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Social Sciences. Unsurprisingly, critical responses to this reasoning have also been published. This paper evaluates <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Generalized Darwinism. It is proposed that its account of organizational ‘evolution’ has two pillars. One is <b>the</b> <b>claim</b> that there are general Darwinian principles and concepts that are common to both the social and biological domains; these are represented by <b>the</b> triadic schema <b>of</b> ‘variation–selection–retention’. <b>The</b> other pillar, originally developed within modern evolutionary biology as a solution to some particular conceptual and theoretical difficulties within it, is the replicator-interactor distinction. The first pillar supports the second pillar. In an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> Generalized Darwinism, it is argued that the second pillar is demonstrably cracked, limited in what it can support, and therefore all too prone to being toppled. As for the first pillar, to which the programme collapses if the second pillar falls, the triadic schema simply represents a general scheme for constructing explanations and it is compatible with a very different approach to <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> social evolution that was originally developed, across various monographs in a fairly piecemeal manner, by the philosopher, Sir Karl Popper. This is an approach that pre-dates Generalized Darwinism, and has also been called ‘evolutionary’, even a ‘generalization of Darwin’ (but not, needless to say, a ‘Generalized Darwinism’). The paper attempts to marshal Popper’s ideas into a more coherent whole so that it may be compared to Generalized Darwinism. This also demonstrates that if the problem is to account for <b>the</b> ‘evolution’ <b>of</b> social organizations, then {{there is no need to}} support the account with the second interactor-replicator pillar of Generalized Darwinism, let alone the neo-Darwinist paraphernalia that plasters it...|$|R

40|$|Interferometers {{are known}} to have higher {{throughput}} than grating spectrometers for the same resolvance. The digital array scanned interferometer (DASI) has been proposed as an instrument that can capitalize on <b>the</b> superior throughput <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interferometer and, simultaneously, be adapted to imaging. The DASI is not <b>the</b> first implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual purpose concept, but it is one that has made several claims of major performance superiority, and it has been developed into a complete instrument. This paper reviews the DASI concept, summarizes its claims, and gives an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> how well <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> are justified. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> signal-to-noise ratio superiority and operational simplicity are realized only modestly, if at all...|$|R

The patients and their representatives take legal action for quality of health care delivery with increasing frequency. For an impartial <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients’ <b>claims</b> and delivery quality control video recording of delivery process was practiced. Materials and methods. The survey comprises <b>the</b> questionnaire <b>of</b> 72  patients and 20  medical workers of a maternity obstetric service concerning their attitude toward video recording in the delivery room. Results. 55. 5  % of all women vote in the affirmative and 19. 4  % countervote, every fourth patient was not sure. 70  % of doctors had a positive attitude to the video reordering. Conclusion. The article deals with <b>the</b> legal aspects <b>of</b> video reordering, both for patients and for medical staff. The study reveals {{a number of problems}} of ethical and legal aspects.

40|$|This book is {{presented}} as a general introduction to <b>the</b> political economy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USSR for readers considering it for the first time. Rutland seeks to place the subject in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> debates over planning and the market which “rage unabated ” among economists in the West, and to enlighten so-cialists in the West who adhere to <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> a planned economy (p. 1). “The myth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan ” refers to “its claims to rationality and its representation as a path to a desirable future ” (p. 247). The author’s “basic message [...] . is that the planning approach is strewn with pitfalls and dangers [...] . ” (p. 2). Rutland compares <b>the</b> positive features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market with <b>the</b> negative features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet economy: Economic systems where the market is dominant do, of course, face severe problems of their own. But it would be impossible within <b>the</b> confines <b>of</b> one book to offer an analysis and <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rival <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> both plan and market. In this volume we merely select <b>the</b> positive features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market (recognizing that it does have some) and use them to aid in our critique of centrally planned economic systems.

40|$|Background. The {{electronic}} {{health record}} (EHR) {{has been promoted}} {{as a tool to}} improve quality of patient care, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. There is little data to confirm that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> EHR has reduced duplicate testing. We sought to evaluate <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> performance of repeat transthoracic echocardiograms before and after <b>the</b> adoption <b>of</b> EHR. Methods. We retrospectively examined <b>the</b> rates <b>of</b> repeat echocardiograms performed before and after <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> an EHR system. Results. <b>The</b> baseline rate <b>of</b> repeat testing before EHR was 4. 6 % at six months and 7. 6 % at twelve months. In the first year following implementation of EHR, 6. 6 % of patients underwent a repeat study within 6 months, and 12. 9 % within twelve months. In the most recent year of EHR usage, 5. 7 % of patients underwent repeat echocardiography at six months and 11. 9 % within twelve months. All rates of duplicate testing were significantly higher than their respective pre-EHR rates (p< 0. 01 for all). Conclusion. Our study failed to demonstrate a reduction in <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> duplicate echocardiography testing after <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> an EHR system. We feel that this data, combined with other recent analyses, should promote a more rigorous <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> benefits associated with EHR implementation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} international standard-setting in <b>the</b> toxicology <b>of</b> pharmaceuticals during <b>the</b> 1990 s, {{which has}} involved both {{the pharmaceutical industry}} and regulatory agencies in an organization known as the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). The analysis shows that the relationships between innovation, regulatory science and `progress' may be more complex and controversial than is often assumed. An <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICH's <b>claims</b> about <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> `technical' harmonization of drug-testing standards for <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> drug safety, via toxicological testing, and <b>the</b> delivery <b>of</b> therapeutic progress, via innovation, is presented. By demonstrating {{that there is not}} a technoscientific validity for these claims, it is argued that, within the ICH, a discourse of technological innovation and scientific progress has been used by regulatory agencies and prominent parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transnational pharmaceutical industry to legitimize the lowering and loosening of toxicological standards for drug testing. The mobilization and acceptance of this discourse are shown to be pivotal to <b>the</b> ICH's transformation <b>of</b> reductions in safety standards, which are apparently against <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> patients and public health, into supposed therapeutic benefits derived from promises of greater access to more innovative drug products. The evidence suggests that it is highly implausible that these reductions in <b>the</b> standards <b>of</b> regulatory toxicology are consistent with therapeutic progress for patients, and highlights a worrying aspect embedded in <b>the</b> `technical trajectories' <b>of</b> regulatory science...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{educational}} research enjoys a methodological and theoretical debate that {{is characterized by}} a number of unresolved and lively debated controversies. This compilation thesis is an attempt to contribute to this debate using <b>the</b> toolbox <b>of</b> philosophy <b>of</b> science. <b>The</b> thesis consists <b>of</b> an introductory chapter and four essays. In the introductory chapter I identify three methodological and theoretical controversies that are discussed within <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> {{educational research}}. These are: 1) the controversy concerning <b>the</b> scientific status <b>of</b> educational research; 2) the controversy between cognitive and sociocultural theories of learning; and, 3) the controversy between realist and constructionist interpretations of theories of learning. I provide in the essays a critical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>claims</b> behind each <b>of</b> these controversies, and argue for an alternative reconstruction of these issues. In Essay I, I criticize a view about <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> human action, labeled in the text as interpretivism. This view posits a sharp separation between the natural and social sciences, to the effect that <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latter cannot be applied to the former. The first controversy seems to rest on this position. As I argue, the arguments in support of interpretivism are contradicted by actual research practice. I conclude that <b>the</b> interpretivistic <b>claims</b> lack support and that <b>the</b> general separation <b>claim</b> appears as problematic. A further debate has fueled the first controversy, that is, the supposed distinction between qualitative and quantitative methods. In Essay II, I argue against this distinction. More specifically, I discuss <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> empirical support in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> qualitative methods (for short, qualitative support). I provide arguments that although there are two specific and non-trivial properties of qualitative support, there is no methodological separation between quantitative and qualitative methods concerning empirical support. Considered together, the first two essays indicate two points of methodological continuity between educational research and other scientific practices (such as the natural sciences). I therefore conclude that the controversy concerning <b>the</b> scientific status <b>of</b> educational research rests in large part on unjustified claims. Essay III focuses on the second controversy. In this article I argue that Suárez’ inferential approach to <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> scientific representation can be used as an account of scientific representation in learning, regardless of whether learning is understood as a cognitive or social phenomenon. The third controversy is discussed in Essay IV. Here, I discuss some ontological aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actor-network theory. Reflecting on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this framework in <b>the</b> research field <b>of</b> Networked Learning, I argue that <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> an ontology <b>of</b> relations provides <b>the</b> solution for two puzzles about <b>the</b> ontology <b>of</b> networks. <b>The</b> relevance <b>of</b> my argument for the third controversy is that it suggests a point of connection between constructionist and realist interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ontology <b>of</b> learning. <b>The</b> last two essays suggest two points of continuities between theoretical frameworks that have been and still are argued to be incompatible. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 2 : Manuscript. </p...|$|R
