5|$|Tokyo Tower's {{two main}} revenue sources are antenna leasing and tourism. It {{functions}} as a radio and television broadcasting <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure and is a tourist destination that houses several different attractions. Over 150million people have visited the tower in total since its opening in late 1958. Tower attendance had been steadily declining until it bottomed out at 2.3million in 2000. Since then, attendance has been rising, and it has recently been attracting approximately 3million visitors per year. The first area tourists must visit upon reaching the tower is FootTown, a four-story building stationed directly under the tower. Here, visitors can eat, shop and visit several museums and galleries. Elevators that depart from {{the first floor of}} FootTown can be used to reach the first of two observation decks, the two-story Main Observatory. For the price of another ticket, visitors can board another set of elevators from {{the second floor of the}} Main Observatory to reach the final observation deckthe Special Observatory.|$|E

50|$|Kettrichhof {{transmitter}} is {{a facility}} for FM- and TV-broadcasting at Kettrichhof, a village {{which is part}} of Lemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is located at an elevation of 436 m a.s.l. The <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> is a guyed mast of latticed steel with a square cross section which was built in 1985 and was originally 210 m tall. When new antennas were added in 2007, the height of the mast was increased to 236 m. Reception of its signals is possible in an area spanning from the Eifel to Karlsruhe and Pforzheim and even in elevated locations on the Swabian Alb. On 4 December 2007, the TV transmitter was switched over to DVB-T, and DAB+ transmissions from Kettrichhof started on 9 September 2015.|$|E
5000|$|The present {{concrete}} {{tower is}} the third <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure to have occupied the site. The original 135 m lattice tower was erected in 1956; to provide Independent Television broadcasts to the Yorkshire area.

50|$|The station Raichberg started {{broadcast}} service on 23 December 1950 as FM radio transmitter operating the program SWF 1 of Südwestfunks. The first transmitting antenna was installed {{at this time}} on the observation tower “Raichbergturm”, which {{is close to the}} current station until today. Since December 1954 a 57 meter high steel tube mast was used as an <b>antenna</b> <b>support.</b> As this tower could not carry TV broadcasting antennas, in 1971 a new steel tube mast went into operation until today. Between September and November 2007 the originally 147 meter high mast was converted to the upcoming digital DVB-T. The old analog VHF antenna was dismantled and a new 62 meter high UHF antenna segment for DVB-T was mounted on the top, thereby the transmission tower shrank from 147 to 137 meters.|$|E
50|$|Golm {{transmitter}} was {{a medium}} wave broadcasting facility {{on the area}} of a former Reichsarbeitsdienst officer candidate school at Kuhforter Damm in Golm near Potsdam. It entered service in 1948 as the central broadcast transmitter for Brandenburg state. Until 1979 it used a wooden lattice tower of 98 m height with a horizontal wooden cross on its top as its <b>antenna</b> <b>support.</b> The ends of the beams of this cross were connected with wires. From the centre {{of each of these}} horizontal wires, a vertical wire was run down to the antenna tuner which was located in a building under the feet of the tower construction. The antenna of Golm transmitter consisted therefore of 4 T-antennas connected in parallel, forming an omnidirectional antenna with a natural wavelength of 528 m. The transmitter was built from second-hand parts obtained by dismantling a site in Reichenbach, Upper Lusatia. Test transmissions were undertaken on 16 April 1948, and from 1 May 1948 the facility operated on 564 kHz.|$|E

5000|$|Transverters {{are used}} in amateur radio to convert radio {{transceivers}} designed for use on the HF or VHF bands to operate on even higher frequency (microwave) bands. A transceiver used in this fashion {{is referred to as}} an IF radio, indicating its role as the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] stage in the chain of radio electronics. Common transceiver/transverter combinations include transverters for 50 MHz, 70 MHz, 144 MHz, 222 MHz, and 432 MHz designed for use with 28 MHz IF radios, and transverters for 50 MHz, 902 MHz, 1296 MHz, 2304 MHz, 3456 MHz, 5706 MHz, and 10368 MHz designed for use with 144 MHz IF radios. Some transverter units include transmit/receive switching built into the design, whereas other units require external switching. The use of external switching is popular in applications where preamps and amplifiers are included. Many transverters are built into waterproof enclosures for installation on a radio tower or other <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure to get the device {{as close as possible to}} the antenna so as to reduce signal loss in the transmission line.|$|E

This instrument samples components of the Fourier transform of the brightness temperature distribution at 1. 4 GHz. Sources of error are identified, including systematic offsets and stochastic noise in the measurements, errors in the interference pattern antenna calibration, multipath scattering from the <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure, mutual coupling between nearby array elements, and variations in the antenna patterns of the array elements. These errors are shown to produce artifacts in the image which appear as 'streaks' running along the instrument flight line. Possible hardware corrections are discussed. These include {{a reduction in the}} profile of the <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> structure and a decoupling of adjacent and other nearby array elements using corrugated 'skirts'. Also discussed are several image enhancement techniques which detect and correct for some of the streaking.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} radiation patterns of electrically small antennas (ESAs) requires a reflectionless environment and minimal disturbance from the <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> and feed cable.

40|$|The NASA Lewis Research Center's Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS) was {{launched}} in September 1993. ACTS introduced several new technologies, including a multibeam antenna (MBA) operating at extremely short wavelengths never before used in communications. This antenna, which has both fixed and rapidly reconfigurable high-energy spot beams (150 miles in diameter), serves users equipped with small antenna terminals. Extensive structural and thermal analyses have been performed for simulating the ACTS MBA on-orbit performance. The {{results show that the}} reflector surfaces (mainly the front subreflector), <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> assembly, and metallic surfaces on the spacecraft body will be distorted because of the thermal effects of varying solar heating, which degrade the ACTS MBA performance. Since ACTS {{was launched}}, a number of evaluations have been performed to assess MBA performance in the space environment. For example, the on-orbit performance measurements found systematic environmental disturbances to the MBA beam pointing. These disturbances were found to be imposed by the attitude control system, antenna and spacecraft mechanical alignments, and on-orbit thermal effects. As a result, the MBA may not always exactly cover the intended service area. In addition, the on-orbit measurements showed that antenna pointing accuracy is the performance parameter most sensitive to thermal distortions on the front subreflector surface and <b>antenna</b> <b>support</b> assemblies. Several compensation approaches were tested and evaluated to restore on-orbit pointing stability. A combination of autotrack (75 percent of the time) and Earth sensor control (25 percent of the time) was found to {{be the best way to}} compensate for antenna pointing error during orbit. This approach greatly minimizes the effects of thermal distortions on antenna beam pointing...|$|E
