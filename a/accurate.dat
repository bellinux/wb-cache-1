5|$|Atomic clocks are {{the most}} <b>accurate</b> {{timekeeping}} devices in practical use today. <b>Accurate</b> to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, {{they are used to}} calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments.|$|E
5|$|HST's {{guidance}} system {{can also be}} used as a scientific instrument. Its three Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but {{can also be used}} to carry out extremely <b>accurate</b> astrometry; measurements <b>accurate</b> to within 0.0003arcseconds have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|When PD diagnoses are {{checked by}} autopsy, {{movement}} disorders experts are found on average to be 79.6% <b>accurate</b> at initial assessment and 83.9% <b>accurate</b> {{after they have}} refined their diagnosis at a follow-up examination. When clinical diagnoses performed mainly by nonexperts are checked by autopsy, average accuracy is 73.8%. Overall, 80.6% of PD diagnoses are <b>accurate,</b> and 82.7% of diagnoses using the Brain Bank criteria are <b>accurate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Al-Zarqali (1028–1087) {{developed}} a more <b>accurate</b> astrolabe, used for centuries afterwards. He constructed a water clock in Toledo. He {{discovered that the}} Sun's apogee moves slowly relative to the fixed stars, and obtained a good estimate of its motion for its rate of change. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) wrote an important revision to Ptolemy's celestial model. When he became Helagu's astrologer, he was given an observatory and gained access to Chinese techniques and observations. He developed trigonometry as a separate field, and compiled the most <b>accurate</b> astronomical tables available up to that time.|$|E
5|$|All {{information}} is <b>accurate</b> {{as of the}} time the season was filmed, and thus may vary from season to season for returning players.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a low-maintenance {{experiment}} was the protein crystal growth experiment, which had also been flown on previous shuttle missions. The goal was to produce better protein crystallizations than those produced on the Earth, and hence allowing for a more <b>accurate</b> model of protein structures. Of the 23 proteins and viruses attempted during Expedition 1, only four resulted in successful crystallizations, which was a lower success rate than predicted. Of those successful was the low-calorie sweetener Thaumatin, whose crystals diffracted at a higher resolution than Earth-grown crystal, {{which resulted in a}} more <b>accurate</b> protein structure model.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{progressive}} alignment method called T-Coffee is {{slower than}} Clustal and its derivatives but generally produces more <b>accurate</b> alignments for distantly related sequence sets. T-Coffee calculates pairwise alignments {{by combining the}} direct alignment of the pair with indirect alignments that aligns each sequence of the pair to a third sequence. It uses the output from Clustal as well as another local alignment program LALIGN, which finds multiple regions of local alignment between two sequences. The resulting alignment and phylogenetic tree are used {{as a guide to}} produce new and more <b>accurate</b> weighting factors.|$|E
5|$|Drivers in Hawaii are not {{required}} to maintain log books, provided their employer keeps an <b>accurate</b> record of their driving time.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{frequent}} merging of parishes {{and changes in}} boundaries, <b>accurate</b> figures based on specific areas are not available.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} were almost all <b>accurate,</b> {{according to the}} philosopher Anthony Preus, though Mario Vegetti argues that Aristotle sometimes let theory cloud observation.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably <b>accurate</b> {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon was assumed to follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently <b>accurate</b> and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, {{the goal was to}} predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn <b>accurate</b> pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was <b>accurate,</b> along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was <b>accurate.</b> A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|In CASP8, Robetta was {{augmented}} to use Rosetta's {{high resolution}} all-atom refinement method, {{the absence of}} which was cited as the main cause for Robetta being less <b>accurate</b> than the Rosetta@home network in CASP7.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, afterloading {{involves}} the <b>accurate</b> positioning of non-radioactive applicators {{in the treatment}} site, which are subsequently loaded with the radiation sources. In manual afterloading, the source is delivered into the applicator by the operator.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} borne {{in mind that}} the {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only <b>accurate</b> if the section is terminated with its image impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end, which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more <b>accurate</b> the prediction will become, since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift made {{reference}} to the moons of Mars, about 150 years before their actual discovery by Asaph Hall, detailing reasonably <b>accurate</b> descriptions of their orbits, in the 19th chapter of his novel Gulliver's Travels.|$|E
5|$|Many {{have noted}} the uncannily <b>accurate</b> way that stories in Flying Aces {{predicted}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor {{as well as the}} locations of other air battles of the Pacific Theater.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without <b>accurate</b> daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less <b>accurate</b> navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of The Great Lover were {{generally}} positive, {{many of them}} noting the ability of Dawson to evoke the personality of Brooke and produce an <b>accurate</b> sense of his contemporaries and contemporary society.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} census of the Congolese {{population}} {{was made in}} 1924, there is a consensus among historians that <b>accurate</b> predictions of the population fall or number of deaths is impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form {{complete}} series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds {{can be described}} as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions. This description is most <b>accurate</b> for alkali halides and becomes less and less <b>accurate</b> as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series NaCl, Na2O, Na2S, Na3P, Na3As, Na3Sb, Na3Bi, Na.|$|E
