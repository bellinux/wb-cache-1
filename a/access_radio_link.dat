40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} uplink scheduling {{in the future}} wireless systems is mirrored in {{the work on the}} high speed uplink packet <b>access</b> (HSUPA) <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> design. The nature of the optimization problems associated with uplink scheduling [H. Bosche et al., 2003; E. M. Yeh, 2002] has shown the importance of geometrical knowledge in the capacity and stability region. This knowledge can significantly facilitate the design of delay scheduling routines. We provide the geometrical analysis of the capacity and stability region in the multi-antenna uplink. We give an insight in the general structure and state general properties of the capacity and stability region. Concentrating on the MIMO-MAC with individual power constraints, we identify and interpret specific points and regions at the boundary and characterise transmit strategies in achieving them. We state a general and sufficient condition for emerging of rate-sum optimal corner points in the capacity and stability region. Finally, we analyse the behaviour of the capacity and stability region in terms of power constraint variation...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} proliferation of new services requiring low-delay and/or high-rate uplinks, such as image/video-upload high-rate streaming, {{there is an}} associated need for flexible and fair uplink scheduling. Especially, {{the design of a}} high speed uplink packet <b>access</b> (HSUPA) <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> scheme for future use mirrors this need. Recently, a number of uplink and downlink scheduling schemes based on combined optimization of the physical layer and the data link layer (so called cross-layer design), were presented (Boche, H. et al., 2003; Neely, M. J. et al., 2003). We extend recent works to the case of arbitrary fading channels. We concentrate on the stability of the queue system as an objective for scheduling and utilize the drift technique for the design of scheduling policies under fading. We propose a simple spatial scheduling policy achieving the largest possible stability region equal to the ergodic capacity region of the multiple access channel (MAC). We show its efficiency and ease of its implementation. Finally, we state several bounds and asymptotics describing the behaviour of the queue system under the optimal policy...|$|R

40|$|In the {{framework}} of new services in wireless networks beyond the third generation, asymmetric and flexible uplink transmission schemes are highly desirable. Hence, especially in "data only" networks, an efficient uplink scheduling must not be neglected in the network design. Although not yet well covered in the literature, this area appears to gain importance especially {{in the face of}} high speed uplink packet <b>access</b> (HSUPA) <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> design for future wireless systems. In this work we study an uplink scheduling scheme from the information theoretic and queueing theoretic point of view. The objective of the cross-layer (Goldsmith, A. J. et al., 2003) scheduling approach we present is the stability of bit-queues awaiting their transmission at every user node. With this approach is associated an optimization problem of maximizing the weighted sum of rates, where the weights express the intensity of packet-traffics at every user node. An important property characterizing our approach is considering only spatial channelization of users, i. e. allocating user signals within one successive interference cancellation (SIC) order fixed over a certain time interval T. We show, that despite this neglection of time sharing technique, it is possible to achieve an overall optimal stability achieving scheduling for every set of user rate weights. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the SIC-order allowing for the optimal scheduling is independent of user channels and that the associated optimization problem over transmit covariance matrices is convex...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel fast-adaptive nonlinear receiver which exploits soft statistics for tracking the random fluctuations experienced by time division multiple <b>access</b> (TDMA) mobile <b>radio</b> <b>links</b> impaired by frequency-selective time-variant multipath phenomena. The detection task {{is accomplished by}} an Abend [...] Fritchman-like symbol-by-symbol maximum likelihood (SbS-ML) detector which delivers both hard decisions and soft statistics in form of a posteriori probabilities (APP's) of {{the states of the}} intersymbol interference (ISI) channel. In the proposed adaptive receiver, these APP's are employed in place of the conventional hard-detected data to feed an ad hoc developed nonlinear recursive Kalman-type channel estimator. Extensive computer simulations show that the exploitation of these soft statistics enhances the tracking capability of the channel estimator so that the proposed receiver generally outperforms the usual ones based on adaptive maximum likelihood sequence estimators (MLSE's) for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values over 12 [...] 13 dB.

It {{has been the subject}} of many research projects and a number of solutions have been suggested. Most of these proposed solutions are trying to improve TCP’s performance in general without looking at a specific technology. UMTS, the universal mobile telecommunication system, is a new standard for mobile networks.

The introduction of retransmission mechanisms in the <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> control layer reduces the error rates of UMTS. An ensuing problem however is that the delay will vary. The delay or reordering of data due to the retransmissions may cause TCP to underutilize the <b>radio</b> <b>link.</b> TCP’s design is based on the assumption that transmission errors occur rarely.

40|$|We {{consider}} a heterogeneous network (HetNet) of base stations (BSs) connected via a backhaul network of routers and wired/wireless links with limited capacity. The optimal provision of such networks requires proper resource allocation across the <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>links</b> {{in conjunction with}} appropriate traffic engineering within the backhaul network. In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for joint resource allocation across the wireless links and the flow control within the backhaul network. The proposed algorithm, which maximizes the minimum rate among all the users and/or flows, {{is based on a}} decomposition approach that leverages both the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and the weighted-MMSE (WMMSE) algorithm. We show that this algorithm is easily parallelizable and converges globally to a stationary solution of the joint optimization problem. The proposed algorithm can also be extended to deal with per-flow quality of service constraint, or to networks with multi-antenna nodes.

Moreover, mobile users in these networks share a common <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>link</b> and, thus, a common bottleneck in case of congestion, which may cause user experience to degrade.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool with which {{it is possible to}} calculate the environmental load from a product, material or service during all the phases in its life cycle. The results presented in this study are based on such an LCA. Radio relay is an alternative to optical fibre cables, but little information was available within Telia on the environmental impact from the use of radio relay systems as a transmission media. The goal of the project is to provide Telia with useful information regarding the systems involved and where and how the environment is affected by the use of the systems. Two types of <b>radio</b> <b>links</b> are looked at in this project: one high capacity, long hop <b>radio</b> <b>link,</b> and one low capacity <b>radio</b> <b>link.</b> The high capacity link is the Nera NL 290, a Norwegian <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> system with an n+ 1 STM 1 capacity. This system is of an older, bulky design. The second <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> in the study is the Ericsson Mini-link E. This <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> {{is one of the most}} common <b>radio</b> <b>links</b> on the market. Six scenarios, or cases, are the basis for the study: two Nera NL 290 cases, two Mini-link E cases, and two optical fibre cable cases. For all systems, there is one worst case scenario, and one best case scenario. The best case scenarios are distinguished by having a higher capacity overall, and covers longer distances. The best case scenarios have the following properties - Product (distance between stations [km] (capacity [Mbps])) : •Optical fibre cable (50 (2. 5 Gbps)) •Nera NL 290 <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> (50 km (310) •Ericsson Mini-link E <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> (30 (34)) The worst case scenarios have the following properties: •Optical fibre cable (30 (155) •Nera NL 290 <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> (30 (155)) •Ericsson Mini-link E <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> (15 (4  2)) Included in the study are production of materials constituting the systems, transports to and from building sites, manufacture of <b>radio</b> <b>links,</b> infrastructure, network elements, and station equipment. The results of the study are: •No clear difference can be seen between the use of <b>radio</b> <b>links</b> or buried optical fibre cables as a transmission media in regards to the environmental impact. •The environmental impact is mainly dependent on the capacity, and secondarily on the distance. •Optical fibre cables have one phase that is clearly more polluting than the res, and that is the actual work of burying the cable in the ground. •The Nera NL 290 is a <b>radio</b> <b>link</b> system with a relatively high content of circuit boards in the construction. •For the Ericsson Mini-link E, there is no obvious phase that is more polluting than the rest, but the overall environmental load is high. •The operation, or use, of the different systems gives an almost negligible contribution to the total environmental load. Suggestions for improvement: •When planning new routes for optical fibre cables, the direction should be chosen so that as much as possible of the cable can be buried with ploughing. •For optical fibre cables, strive to build the cable together with other construction efforts. •Secure the cable installation for the long term. •For <b>radio</b> <b>links,</b> use existing infrastructure to as high degree as possible. •Build flexible systems that can handle additional capacity with upgrades. •When building new infrastructure for radio relay or mobile phone sites, endeavour to build the mast/tower on solid rock base. •The use of LED-type obstruction lights canwww. ima. kth. s...|$|R
