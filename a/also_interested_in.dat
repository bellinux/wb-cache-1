5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were <b>also</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{the bodies of}} animals and humans, {{studying}} physiology in detail and contributing {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's distant cousin, Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson II (grandson {{of former}} vice {{president}} Adlai Stevenson I), was considered his primary competition for the nomination, but had not committed before the convention.

Democratic National Committee chairman Frank E. McKinney, former chairman James Farley, and Senate Secretary Leslie Biffle also supported him. Two weeks before the convention, Stevenson advisor Jacob Arvey told Barkley that Stevenson {{was not going to}} be nominated and favored nominating Barkley. Barkley's advisors believed that Kefauver and Russell would knock each other out of the early balloting, allowing Barkley to capture the nomination.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tokyo, Japan, on July 5, 1968, Ito became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} four.

He was <b>also</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> Electone music, but was discouraged from learning it by a piano teacher. By the time he began composing at the age of ten, he had learned to play alto saxophone, clarinet, and piano, and was interested in becoming a singer/songwriter. When he was close to graduating from college, he decided to pursue a career in composing music; when he asked a professor for advice, the professor recommended becoming a video game music composer, given the recent success in Japan of Dragon Quest III. During March 1990, after applying to several video game companies including HAL Laboratory, Ito began working at Square.|$|E
5|$|Britain had {{recognised}} Zanzibar's {{sovereignty and}} its sultanate in 1886, {{after a long}} period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans. However, Germany was <b>also</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century. Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands. Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which resulted in some unrest. In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population. One such conflict in Tanga claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.|$|E
5|$|For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out {{to recruit}} some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada.

A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including J.
