5|$|A {{widely used}} zinc alloy is brass, in which copper is alloyed with {{anywhere}} from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than copper, and has superior corrosion resistance. These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.|$|E

An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions. A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need {{for the development of}} regional conservation strategies.|$|E

5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather.

5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond, a {{component}} of all organofluorine compounds, is the strongest chemical bond in organic chemistry.

5|$|The navies of Britain and France in 1794 were at very {{different}} stages of development. Although the British fleet was numerically superior, the French ships were larger <b>and</b> <b>stronger,</b> and carried a heavier weight of shot.

5|$|Willis renewed {{his call}} for an income tax repeal in the 1946 {{legislative}} session, but Democrats opposed the repeal and Republicans were split on the issue. The proposal failed {{by a vote of}} 36–60. Accomplishments of the session included better mine safety laws <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> concealed weapons laws, and increased funding for black education. The war's end had brought additional revenue sources, and even with an expanded budget, the state experienced an $18 million surplus by the end of Willis's term.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E

5|$|A {{widely used}} alloy which {{contains}} zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, {{depending upon the}} type of brass. Brass is generally more ductile <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than copper and has superior corrosion resistance.

Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze. Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries. These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak. Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed {{in the form of}} zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.|$|E

One day, Nakai Baisei (a {{friend of the}} family {{who was a member of}} the shogun's guard), {{mentioned}} that jūjutsu was an excellent form of physical training. He showed Kanō a few techniques by which a smaller man might overcome a larger <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> opponent. Kanō decided he wanted to learn the art despite Nakai's insistence that such training was out of date and somewhat dangerous. Kanō's father also discouraged him from jūjutsu, telling him to pursue a modern sport instead.|$|E
5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E

He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren {{as an act of}} revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery.

5|$|In frogs the {{pelvic girdle}} is robust and the hind legs are much longer <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> than the forelimbs. The feet have {{four or five}} digits and the toes are often webbed for {{swimming}} or have suction pads for climbing. Frogs have large eyes and no tail. Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or {{in contact with the}} ground and they have a long tail. Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless. They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.|$|E

5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in time to catch it.|$|E
5|$|Ine's {{predecessor}} on {{the throne}} of Wessex was Cædwalla, {{but there is some}} uncertainty about the transition from Cædwalla to Ine. Cædwalla abdicated in 688 and departed for Rome to be baptized. According to the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List, Ine reigned for 37 years, abdicating in 726. These dates imply that he did not gain the throne until 689, which could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. Ine may have ruled alongside his father, Cenred, for a period: there is weak evidence for joint kingships, <b>and</b> <b>stronger</b> evidence of subkings reigning under a dominant ruler in Wessex, not long before this time. Ine acknowledges his father's help in his code of laws, and there is also a surviving land-grant that indicates Cenred was still reigning in Wessex after Ine's accession.|$|E
