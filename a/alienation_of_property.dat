In {{the place of}} feudal lords capable of {{military}} support, they found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns. And these lands were really under foreign dominion. Even before the time of Pope Gregory VII {{there had been a}} struggle between the princes and the papacy over the question of [...] "investitures," [...] the question that is of who should appoint the bishops. If that power rested with the Pope and not the King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of his subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions. For also the clergy claimed exemption from taxation. They paid their taxes to Rome. And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax of one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes he paid his prince.|$|E
60|$|To {{begin with}} the first great {{instrument}} of national happiness and strength, its industry: I must observe, that, although these penal laws do, indeed, inflict many hardships on those who are obnoxious to them, yet their chief, their most extensive, and most certain operation is upon property. Those civil constitutions which promote industry are such as facilitate the acquisition, secure the holding, enable the fixing, and suffer the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> Every law which obstructs it {{in any part of}} this distribution is, in proportion to the force and extent of the obstruction, a discouragement to industry. For a law against property is a law against industry,--the latter having always the former, and nothing else, for its object. Now as to the acquisition of landed property, which is the foundation and support of all the other kinds, the laws have disabled three fourths of the inhabitants of Ireland from acquiring any estate of inheritance for life or years, or any charge whatsoever on which two thirds of the improved yearly value is not reserved for thirty years.|$|E

5000|$|There is a {{commonly}} noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word alienation, and similar {{words such as}} estrangement, are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, Entfremdung and Entäußerung.

50|$|The {{separation}} doctrine {{states that}} obligationary agreements for alienation and conveyances that effect that alienation {{must be treated}} separately and follow their own rules. Also, under the abstract system, alienation {{does not depend on}} the validity of the underlying causa of the obligationary contract; in other words, a conveyance is sine causa (without legal consideration). From this differentiation it follows that a mere obligationary agreement, such as for the sale of property, does not transfer ownership if and until a separate legal instrument, the conveyance, has been drawn up and goes into effect; conversely, the <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> based on an invalid obligationary agreement may give rise to a restitutionary obligation for the transferee to restore the property (e.g. unjust enrichment), but until the property is re-conveyed, again by way of a conveyance, the transferred property is not affected.|$|E
50|$|One of the BGB's {{fundamental}} components is {{the doctrine}} of abstract <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> (German: Abstraktionsprinzip), and its corollary, the separation doctrine (Trennungsprinzip). Derived from {{the works of the}} pandectist scholar Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the Code draws a sharp distinction between obligationary agreements (BGB, Book 2), which create enforceable obligations, and “real” or alienation agreements (BGB, Book 3), which transfer property rights. In short, the two doctrines state: the owner having an obligation to transfer ownership does not make you the owner, but merely gives you the right to demand the transfer of ownership. The opposite system, the causal system, is in effect in France and other legal jurisdictions influenced by French law, under which an obligationary agreement is sufficient to transfer ownership; no subsequent conveyance is needed. The German system thus mirrors the English common law differentiation between in rem rights and in personam rights.|$|E

5000|$|But, while du Perron {{was still}} in Rome, Pope Paul V decided to pick a quarrel with the Serene Republic of Venice, over its conduct in exercising its {{sovereign}} rights. The Venetian government had passed a law against <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> {{in favor of the}} Church, and another requiring governmental approval for the building of new churches. In addition, there was the very old argument over the exemption of the clergy from civil court jurisdiction. On April 17, 1606, Pope Paul launched a bull against Venice, imposing an interdict on all the territories belonging to the Serenissima. This was certain to lead to war, and would very likely excite the greed of Spain for additional territory in Lombardy. [...] King Henri IV, wishing to prevent this, proposed mediation between the Pope and Venice, and offered Cardinal de Joyeuse and Cardinal du Perron as mediators. The status of the Jesuits, who supported the papal interdict, became the main sticking point; the Venetians wanted them gone. Finally, due to the forceful persuasion of Cardinal de Joyeuse (du Perron claimed to be ill), the Pope gave way, the edict was withdrawn, and the crisis averted. Nonetheless, for the work that he had done, the Republic offered du Perron its thanks.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the nature of {{assignment}} as it relates to contractual debts and contractual rights in general, before addressing problems presented by non-assignment clauses. 1 The assignment of things in action sits precariously between contract law and property law and non-assignment clauses cannot properly be understood without an appreciation of this hybrid character of assignment. 2 Non-assignment clauses pose the question whether and in what circumstances contractual rights are items <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> They also demand an examination of the doctrine of privity of contract and a response to the question whether one contracting party has the right unilaterally to vary the contract. Finally, non-assignment clauses set two primary values at odds with each other, namely freedom of contract and the free <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> items <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> To a significant extent, the practical problems presented by non-assignment clauses will diminish when expected secondary legislation nullifying non-assignment clauses in the field of receivables (or book debts) comes into force, 3 but some of the leading cases do not involve receivables and the subject therefore continues to merit attention for practical as well as for theoretical reasons...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm.

Such deemed disposal triggers {{a capital gains tax}} charge. Commonly referred to as the ‘exit tax’, it has been in place since the introduction of capital gains tax on 1 October 2001. A recent ruling in the Supreme Court of Appeals found that according to article 13 of a double tax agreement (hereafter “DTA”) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Model Tax Convention, a deemed disposal is regarded as an <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> and (provided the exclusions do not apply) exclusive taxing rights are given to the Resident State. This has the effect to include the deemed disposal rules relating to exit taxes under this article and potentially override the application of an exit tax under domestic legislation. The override of exit taxes based on a DTA can deprive a country of its fair share of taxes and there is no protection for a country’s tax base. It is important to understand the exit tax and the interaction with DTAs to ensure that there is fairness and equity in the South African income tax system...|$|E

If the administrators of an ecclesiastical institution refuse to accept a donation, that institution can always obtain in canon law a restitutio in integrum, whereby it is again put in a condition to accept the refused donation. The canonical motives for the revocation or diminution of a donation are the birth of children to the donor and the donatio inofficiosa, or excessive generosity on the latter's part, whereby he diminishes the share of inheritance that legitimately belongs to his children. In both cases, however, the donation is valid in Canon law to the degree in which it respects the legitimate share of the donor's children.
