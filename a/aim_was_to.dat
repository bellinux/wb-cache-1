5|$|To {{develop the}} game's overall aesthetic, the main <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create designs that would combine comic book style with realism. The {{environmental}} architecture and characters {{had to be}} extravagant enough to represent the Batman universe, but needed realistic texture and detail. The second <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> recreate the dark, Gothic imagery inherent to the Batman universe, especially Arkham Asylum, so that the structure would feel as insane as those whom it houses. The asylum was considered an ideal location because it can house many of Batman's foes.|$|E
5|$|Guy Fawkes, who {{was born}} and educated in York, {{was a member of}} a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{displace}} Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility were inside.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Ocean Press, in {{cooperation}} with the Che Guevara Publishing Project, released Che: The Diaries of Ernesto Che Guevara, with a movie tie-in cover.

40|$|Computers {{have become}} commonplace in our {{personal}} {{as well as}} our professional lives. Computers have made many of our everyday tasks easier and faster and made our society more productive. A very important set of variables such as the classroom teacher and the teacher’s attitudes towards the effective uses of computers in the classroom have been overlooked in EFL classrooms. This study investigates how teachers perceive the use of computer technology resources in English Language Teaching. The first aim of the study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> define the teachers’ attitudes. The second <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> discuss the aspects of attitude. The third <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explain teachers’ attitudes and computer technology training. The fourth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> elaborate teachers’ attitudes and computer technology integration. The fifth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> define teachers’ attitudes and computer experience. The sixth <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> discuss teachers’ attitudes and computer anxiety and interest. The last <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> review teachers’ attitudes and computer literacy. The review of the related literature shows that simply introducing computer technology resources does not guarantee teachers’ use of these in practice. Knowledge of EFL teachers’ attitudes about teaching, learning, and computers, affords them the opportunity to design and implement EFL instruction...|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a number}} of other Australians were {{subsequently}} involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918–1919, but they also saw little fighting. Malleson's <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead his soldiers became involved in fighting the Bolsheviks around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Polytechnic-Foreign Specialised Institutions (Poly-FSI) {{initiative}} {{was introduced by}} the Ministry of Education in 2005. Its <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> encourage polytechnics to partner with overseas universities to offer degree programmes in niche areas. Through this initiative, students would enjoy a more enriching learning experience in areas that also supported Singapore’s economic development.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan for}} the battle was {{straightforward}} for both sides. The Russians wanted {{to break through the}} Polish defences to Warsaw, while the Polish <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> defend the area long enough for a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by General Józef Piłsudski, and north, led by General Władysław Sikorski, to outflank the attacking forces.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry held {{jointly by}} the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, {{so as not to}} prejudice further legal proceedings.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E

5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{draw attention to}} the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, the <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E

5|$|Berry {{joined the}} Green Party at age 28, {{and became a}} {{prominent}} green transport campaigner. She was Principal Speaker of the Green Party from 2006 to 2007, before becoming the Green candidate for the 2008 mayoral election. She first stood for election at Camden Borough Council in 2002, and {{was elected to the}} council in May 2014. Having had a variety of jobs, {{at the time of the}} election she was primarily an author and worked for the Campaign for Better Transport. Berry made increasing affordable housing a key policy area in her mayoral campaign, through brownfield building, capping rents and preventing foreign businesses from purchasing homes. Her <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prioritise sustainability oriented policies over those which seek economic growth.|$|E
5|$|By mid-December 1963, Indonesian {{had sent}} a {{commando}} unit consisting of 128 volunteers and 35 regular soldiers to Sebatik. Their <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take Kalabakan, then invade Tawau and Sandakan. On 29 December 1963, the Indonesian unit attacked the 3rd Royal Malay Regiment unit. The Indonesians managed to throw several grenades into the totally unprepared Malay Regiment's sleeping quarters. The attack resulted in eight Malay soldiers being killed and nineteen wounded. Malaysian armed police eventually drove the attackers north after a two-hour battle.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> show {{the court that}} a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E

The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, {{who had previously}} worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> create a more accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work {{was provided by the}} rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
