5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, {{sometimes}} {{in opposition to}} other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

Edelen confirmed that his investigation indicated that laws had been broken, and the report {{was turned over to}} the state attorney general for investigation. Minutes after the report was released, Farmer's lawyer made a public statement in which he opined, [...] "I don't see <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> audit report that any law-enforcement agency is going to be excited about." [...] He conceded that Farmer had declined to be interviewed during the investigation but felt it was unfair that Farmer was not given a chance to review or comment on the final report prior to its release.|$|E

[...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is so grateful to be flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart studied {{counterpoint}} {{when young}} with Padre Martini in Bologna. However, the major impetus to fugal writing for Mozart was {{the influence of}} Baron Gottfried van Swieten in Vienna around 1782. Van Swieten, during diplomatic service in Berlin, had taken the opportunity to collect as many manuscripts by Bach and Handel as he could, and he invited Mozart to study his collection and also encouraged him to transcribe various works for other combinations of instruments. Mozart was evidently fascinated by these works, and wrote a set of transcriptions for string trio of fugues from Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, introducing them with preludes of his own. In {{a letter to his}} sister, dated in Vienna on April 20, 1782, Mozart recognizes that he had not written <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> form, but moved by the interest of Constance he composed one piece, which is sent with the letter. He begs her sister does not let anybody to see the fugue and manifests the hope to write five more and then present them to Baron van Swieten. Regarding the piece, he said [...] "I have taken particular care to write andante maestoso upon it, so that it should not be played fast -for if a fugue is not played slowly the ear cannot clearly distinguish the new subject as it is introduced and the effect is missed". Mozart then set to writing fugues on his own, mimicking the Baroque style. These included the fugues for string quartet, K. 405 (1782) and a fugue in C Minor K. 426 for two pianos (1783). Later, Mozart incorporated fugal writing into his opera Die Zauberflöte and the finale of his Symphony No. 41. The parts of the Requiem he completed also contain several fugues (most notably the Kyrie, and the three fugues in the Domine Jesu; he also left behind a sketch for an Amen fugue which, some believe, would have come {{at the end of the}} Sequentia).|$|E
