50|$|<b>Algestone</b> acetonide (USAN, BAN) (developmental {{code name}} W-3395), {{also known as}} <b>algestone</b> 16α,17α-acetonide or 16α,17α-isopropylidenedioxyprogesterone, is a steroidal {{progestin}} that was never marketed. It is the acetonide cyclic ketal of <b>algestone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Algestone</b> acetophenide (USAN) (brand names Neolutin, Droxone, Deladroxone, Decadroxone, Dexadroxate, Bovitrol), {{also known}} as dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide (DHPA), is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that {{is used as a}} contraceptive. It is marketed in combination with estradiol enanthate as a combined injectable contraceptive. The drug is the ketal formed between <b>algestone</b> and acetophenone. <b>Algestone</b> acetophenide is said to be both more potent and longer-acting than hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Unlike many other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives but similarly to hydroxyprogesterone caproate, <b>algestone</b> acetophenide is reported to possess no glucocorticoid activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Algestone</b> (INN) (brand names Alphasone, Alfasone), {{also known}} as 16α,17α-dihydroxyprogesterone, is a steroidal {{progestin}} used as a contraceptive drug.|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, acetophenide is a {{functional}} group which {{is composed of}} the cyclic ketal of a diol with acetophenone. It is seen in <b>algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide) and amcinafide (triamcinolone acetophenide).|$|E
50|$|Estradiol is also widely {{available}} in combination with progestogens. It is available in combination with norethisterone acetate under the major brand names Activelle, Cliane, Estalis, Eviana, Evorel Conti, Evorel Sequi, Kliogest, Novofem, Sequidot, and Trisequens; with drospirenone as Angeliq; with dydrogesterone as Femoston, Femoston Conti; and with nomegestrol acetate as Zoely. Estradiol valerate is available with cyproterone acetate as Climen; with dienogest as Climodien and Qlaira; with norgestrel as Cyclo-Progynova and Progyluton; with levonorgestrel as Klimonorm; with medroxyprogesterone acetate as Divina and Indivina; and with norethisterone enanthate as Mesigyna and Mesygest. Estradiol cypionate is available with medroxyprogesterone acetate as Cyclo-Provera, Cyclofem, Feminena, Lunelle, and Novafem; estradiol enanthate with <b>algestone</b> acetophenide as Deladroxate, Nomagest, and Novular and with <b>algestone</b> acetonide as Topasel and Yectames; and estradiol benzoate is marketed with progesterone as Mestrolar and Nomestrol.|$|E
50|$|Gestonorone caproate, {{also known}} as norhydroxyprogesterone caproate, 17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 17α-hexanoate, or 17α-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17α-hexanoate, is a {{synthetic}} norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with a hexanoate (caproate) ester at the C17α position. Analogues of gestonorone caproate include <b>algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), demegestone, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate (nestorone).|$|E
50|$|OHPC, {{also known}} as 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate or as 17α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione C17α hexanoate, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a hexanoate (caproate) ester at the C17α position. Analogues of MGA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as <b>algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate (norhydroxyprogesterone caproate), hydroxyprogesterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and megestrol acetate.|$|E
50|$|Estradiol {{butyrate}} benzoate, or estradiol 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate, {{also known}} as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate, is a semisynthetic, steroidal estrogen and an estrogen ester - specifically, the 3-benzoate 17β-n-butyrate diester of estradiol - which was never marketed. Under the tentative brand name Unimens, estradiol butyrate benzoate was studied {{in combination with the}} progestogen <b>algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide) as a once-monthly combined injectable contraceptive (at doses of 10 mg and 150 mg, respectively).|$|E
50|$|Gestadienol acetate, {{also known}} as norhydroxy-δ6-progesterone acetate, 6-dehydro-17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 17α-acetate, or 17α-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4,6-diene-3,20-dione 17α-acetate, is a {{synthetic}} norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a combined derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17α-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with an acetate ester at the C17α position and a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions. Analogues of gestadienol acetate include <b>algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), demegestone, gestonorone caproate (norhydroxyprogesterone caproate), hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate (nestorone).|$|E
40|$|The {{identity}} was elucidated of a compound detected in an application site and not identical to any compound {{known to be}} used as an anabolic agent or veterinary drug. The compound was identified as <b>Algestone</b> acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide (DHPA)). For complete identification information obtained with a number of molecular spectroscopic techniques was combined. The {{identity was}} confirmed by comparing the spectroscopic data obtained with those of the reference compound. For meat inspection purposes diagnostic ions for the compound as HFB-derivative were established. Within the Netherlands the standard was made available to the appropriate government laboratories for regulatory purposes. The extent of the use of DHPA remains to be established. ...|$|E
