40|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants are usually {{installed}} in locations with high yearly average solar radiation, often deserts. In such conditions, cooling water required for thermodynamic cycles is rarely available. Moreover, when solar radiation is high, ambient temperature {{is very high}} as well; this leads to excessive condensation temperature, especially when air-condensers are used, and decreases the plant efficiency. However, temperature variation in deserts is often very high, which drives to relatively low temperatures during the night. This fact can be exploited {{with the use of}} a closed cooling system, so that the coolant (water) is chilled during the night and store. Chilled water is then used during peak temperature hours to cool the condenser (dry cooling), thus enhancing power output and efficiency. The present work analyzes the performance improvement achieved by night thermal cool storage, compared to its equivalent <b>air</b> <b>cooled</b> power <b>plant.</b> Dry <b>cooling</b> is proved to be energy-effective for moderately high day–night temperature differences (20 °C), often found in desert locations.

A correlation between weather trends and production is outlined. Finally an economic cost/benefit analysis performed to determine the payback period for implementing the proposed system. The cold side TES system is shown to shift substantial power generation capability from nighttime to daytime when electrical demand is highest, especially during hot summer months. For example, daily energy production is shown to increase by up to 18 % under particularly favorable conditions. This redistribution of the power generation curve is accomplished {{with less than a}} 5 % reduction in overall annual energy production in Mega-Watt hours. The system is shown to be more effective at shifting power generation capacity during warmer months than cooler months. The reduced day to night temperature fluctuation during cooler months results in a reduced thermal storage benefit under similar parasitic loads. The economic benefits of this system are dependent upon the on-peak vs off-peak electricity prices. Economic analysis using 2011 transient price data from the U. S. Midwest Region results in a small increase in annual income. The increased income from the proposed cold side TES system is found to be insufficient to outweigh the required capital investment at current electricity prices. by Daniel David Williams. Thesis (S.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the spatial variation of temperature, relative humidity and black globe humidity temperature (BGHT) index in growing-finishing swine facilities, with and without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> The experiment was conducted in a 60 x 9 m facility containing 32 pens of 3. 20 x 4. 00 m each, divided into two sectors. The treatments were without evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> (control) and with evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> Temperature and relative humidity data were collected weekly in two periods (morning and afternoon) at 32 different sampling points, encompassing the center of each pen and the outer perimeter of the facility. Animal performance variables were: feed intake, feed conversion, weight out of the nursery, slaughter weight, weight gain and daily weight gain. According to the results, the analyzed variables showed spatial dependence, with lower temperature and higher relative humidity in the evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> environment. However, evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> system provided better environment thermal conditions inside the facilities, lowering BGHT values, which were lower in the adiabatic cooling sector.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} chiller energy {{consumption}} {{in a central}} air-conditioning system, a heat exchanger, acting as an <b>air</b> <b>cooler,</b> can be installed before an air handling unit to pre-cool the fresh <b>air</b> by recovering <b>cooling</b> capacity from exhaust air. However, studies on evaluating the performances of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under condensation condition are limited. Therefore, an experimental {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the plate type <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> performance under four operating modes (dry/wet mode, low/high air humidity). Under dry operating mode, the <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> serves as a traditional air cooler; while under wet operating mode, it works as an indirect evaporative cooler (IEC). The cooler dynamic performances during different operating mode transition were investigated. The steady performances under different parameter influence were also comparatively studied. The results show that wet operating improves the sensible and latent <b>cooling</b> capacities of <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> significantly. Condensation takes place under high humidity inlet air, results in decreasing of sensible efficiency but increasing of latent efficiency and total heat transfer rate. The coefficient of performance (COP) of IEC is higher than that of traditional <b>air</b> <b>cooler</b> under the same testing configuration. The highest COP can reach 9. 0 and achieved under wet operating mode with condensation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
