5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>diet</b> {{was changed}} through this {{friendship}} {{as well as}} due to the changes forced through boycott and hostilities with England. After a time, trade resumed with the West Indies but was limited to necessities. Items that sustained the war effort in America were traded, with crops such as rice from the Carolinas shipped out and coffee beans imported in order to brew America's new beverage of choice.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen as a more civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented as a more patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

50|$|Although {{different}} regions of the United States established their own specific cuisines, several aspects of <b>Americans</b> <b>diets</b> remained consistent across the continent. Pork and turkey were widely eaten and considered staples among Americans, and alcohol consumption dominated the beverages throughout the country.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of the new state was quite small at first {{and there was a}} strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers that dominated in the eastern/northeastern portions {{of the state and the}} Spanish-speaking former Mexicans that dominated in the southern and western portions of the state. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of Longhorn cattle that roamed the state. Hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity that many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the <b>American</b> <b>diet).</b>|$|E
25|$|Taurine {{levels were}} found to be {{significantly}} lower in vegans than in a control group on a standard <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> Plasma taurine was 78% of control values, and urinary taurine was 29%.|$|E

40|$|As {{obesity and}} being {{overweight}} {{continue to increase}} in the United States, public concern is growing {{about the quality of}} <b>American</b> <b>diets.</b> We compare the changes in nutrients contributed by major food groups in the periods 1953 - 1980 and 1981 - 2008 and find that there is reduced cholesterol intake and increased calcium intake, but the levels of food energy and total fats increase substantially. To understand how economic factors affect the overall nutritional quality of <b>American</b> <b>diets,</b> we estimate a complete food demand system and conduct a nutrient demand analysis. Among our findings, we conclude that some price manipulations such as subsidizing fruits and vegetables could be effective to increase produce consumption, but the effects of taxing fats to reduce the consumption of fats could be limited. Increasing income would improve intakes of nutrients such as calcium and various vitamins (likely now insufficient), but intakes of nutrients such as energy, saturated fats, and cholesterol (likely now excessive) would also rise with increased income...|$|R

50|$|Meat {{is a major}} {{component}} of <b>American</b> <b>diets.</b> Data from 1960 show the combined annual per capita consumption of beef, pork and chicken at 148 pounds; in 2004, that amount increased to 195 pounds a year. Ground beef made up 42% of the beef market in 2000. Beef consumption, particularly ground and processed beef, is highest in households with incomes at or below 130 percent of the poverty level.|$|R
25|$|Doctors Dean Ornish, T. Colin Campbell, John A. McDougall, Caldwell Esselstyn and Neal D. Barnard {{claim that}} high animal fat and protein diets, {{such as the}} {{standard}} <b>American</b> <b>diet,</b> are detrimental to health. They also state that a lifestyle change incorporating a low fat vegetarian or vegan diet could not only prevent various degenerative diseases, such as coronary artery disease, but reverse them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Americans had {{inherited}} a hearty drinking tradition. Many types of alcohol were consumed. One {{reason for this}} heavy drinking was attributed to an overabundance of corn on the western frontier, which encouraged the widespread production of cheap whiskey. It was {{at this time that}} alcohol became {{an important part of the}} <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> In the 1820s, Americans drank seven gallons of alcohol per person annually.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North <b>American</b> <b>diet,</b> so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, we did find a significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rickets was {{formerly}} {{a major public}} health problem among the US population; in Denver, where ultraviolet rays are about 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude, almost two-thirds of 500 children had mild rickets in the late 1920s. An increase {{in the proportion of}} animal protein in the 20th century <b>American</b> <b>diet</b> coupled with increased consumption of milk fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic {{decline in the number of}} rickets cases. Also, in the United States and Canada, vitamin D-fortified milk, infant vitamin supplements, and vitamin supplements have helped to eradicate the majority of cases of rickets for children with fat malabsorption conditions.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Inuit diets derive {{approximately}} 50% {{of their}} calories from fat, 30–35% from protein and 15–20% of their calories from carbohydrates, {{largely in the}} form of glycogen from the raw meat they consumed. This high fat content provides valuable energy and prevents protein poisoning, which historically was sometimes a problem in late winter when game animals grew lean through winter starvation. It has been suggested that because the fats of the Inuit's wild-caught game are largely monounsaturated and rich in omega-3 fatty acids, the diet does not pose the same health risks as a typical Western high-fat diet. However, actual evidence has shown that Inuit have a similar prevalence of coronary artery disease as non-Inuit populations and they have excessive mortality due to cerebrovascular strokes, with twice the risk to that of the North American population. Indeed, the cardiovascular risk of this diet is so severe that the addition of a more standard <b>American</b> <b>diet</b> has reduced the incidence of mortality in Inuit population. Furthermore, fish oil supplement studies have failed to support claims of preventing heart attacks or strokes.|$|E
500|$|Game {{had begun}} to become scarce in the region east of the Mississippi River. This could have been from over-hunting, or the game could have been driven westward as the colonial {{population}} increased. Fortunately, Irish and Scottish immigrants had been importing cattle into the American colonies during {{the early part of}} the 18th century. Consequently, when game was becoming scarce and mutton had a [...] placed upon it, cattle were available to take their place as a protein source. This change increased farmers' profit from animal husbandry. Cattle raising had begun on a small scale during the French-Indian War, but when the American Revolution came, farmers were able to increase their cattle holdings and increase the presence of beef in the <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> In addition to beef production, the cattle also increased the production of milk and dairy products like butter. This may have contributed to the preference for butter over pork fat, especially in the northern colonies.|$|E
40|$|Pea-sized pouches {{can develop}} in the wall of our large {{intestines}} as we age. This condition is called diverticulosis. No one is sure why the pouches form, but diets high in fats and carbohydrates and low in fiber may contribute by causing food {{to move through the}} intestine more slowly, increasing pressure and straining, and resulting in constipation. This may weaken the walls of the colon and promote diverticulosis.

2500|$|In 2003 the World Health Organisation {{recommended}} that trans fats make up {{no more than}} 1% of a person's diet. In 2013, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils (which contain trans fats) are not [...] "generally recognized as safe", which was expected {{to lead to a}} ban on industrially produced trans fats in the <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> On 16 June 2015, the FDA finalized its determination that trans fats are not generally recognized as safe, and set a three-year time limit for their removal from all processed foods.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book Cholesterol and The French Paradox, Frank Cooper {{argues that}} the French paradox {{is due to the}} lack of {{hydrogenated}} and trans fats in the French diet. The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon butyric acid to the 16-carbon palmitic acid. But the <b>American</b> <b>diet</b> includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids. [...] In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of trans fats which may have associated health risks.|$|E
40|$|Background:Few calcium balance {{data are}} {{available}} from young children {{on which to base}} dietary recommendations. Objective:The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the relation between calcium intake and balance in healthy children aged 19 ̆ 64 y consuming typical <b>American</b> <b>diets.</b> Design:Subjects were assigned to a diet with nutrient intakes similar to those of their usual diet. Calcium absorption was assessed by using a dual-tracer stable-isotope technique. Endogenous fecal excretion was measured in a subset of children, and net calcium balance was calculated. Results:Mean calcium intake was 551 mg/d (range: 124 - 983 mg/d), and mean (1 SEM) calcium retention was 161 1 17 mg/d. Both linear and nonlinear modeling of balance data showed that a calcium intake of 470 mg/d led to calcium retention of 140 mg/d, which is the amount that meets expected bone growth needs in children of this age. No evidence was found that calcium intakes of 800 to 900 mg/d reached the threshold intake beyond which no additional increase in calcium retention would occur. Conclusions:Bone growth needs in 1 - 4 -y-old children following <b>American</b> <b>diets</b> are met by a daily calcium intake of 470 mg/d, which suggests that the current Adequate Intake of 500 mg/d is close to the actual Estimated Average Requirement. The benefits and risks of higher calcium intakes consistent with threshold values should be evaluated in a controlled trial before those intakes could be used as a basis for dietary recommendations...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the folic acid {{fortification}} program, fortified foods have become a major source of folic acid in the <b>American</b> <b>diet.</b> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia used data from 23 birth defect registries covering about half of United States births, and extrapolated their findings {{to the rest of the}} country. [...] These data indicate that, since the addition of folic acid in grain-based foods as mandated by the FDA, the rate of neural tube defects dropped by 25% in the United States.
