However, current dosage given during VNS is increased incrementally at the doctor’s office until side effects present themselves in a patient.

In untrained adults, the novelty of most resistance training programs may be sufficient to promote hypertrophy and strength gains, whereas greater training intensity may be more beneficial for trained adults.

40|$|Objective. To {{develop a}} {{conceptual}} computational agent-based model (ABM) to explore community-wide versus spatially focused crime reporting interventions to reduce community crime perpetrated by youth. Method. Agents within the model represent individual residents and interact on a two-dimensional grid representing an abstract nonempirically grounded community setting. Juvenile agents are assigned initial random probabilities of perpetrating {{a crime and}} adults are assigned random probabilities of witnessing and reporting crimes. The agents' behavioral probabilities modify depending on the individual's experience with criminal behavior and punishment, and exposure to community crime interventions. Cost-effectiveness analyses assessed the impact of <b>activating</b> different <b>percentages</b> of adults to increase reporting and reduce community crime activity. Community-wide interventions were compared with spatially focused interventions, in which activated adults were focused in areas of highest crime prevalence. Results. The ABM suggests that both community-wide and spatially focused interventions can be effective in reducing overall offenses, but their relative effectiveness may depend on the intensity and cost of the interventions. Although spatially focused intervention yielded localized reductions in crimes, such interventions were shown to move crime to nearby communities. Community-wide interventions can achieve larger reductions in overall community crime offenses than spatially focused interventions, as long as sufficient resources are available. Conclusion. The ABM demonstrates that community-wide and spatially focused crime strategies produce unique intervention dynamics influencing juvenile crime behaviors through the decisions and actions of community adults. It shows how such models {{might be used to}} investigate community-supported crime intervention programs by integrating community input and expertise and provides a simulated setting for assessing dimensions of cost comparison and intervention effect sustainability.

40|$|Postural {{control is}} a {{prerequisite}} for daily activities like reaching and standing. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) are hampered by postural dysfunction. Postural control consists of two levels: 1) basic direction-specificity, meaning for instance that when the body moves forwards the dorsal muscles are primarily activated; 2) fine-tuning of the direction-specific adjustment, for example by adapting the recruitment order of direction-specific muscles. However, {{little is known about the}} development of postural control and the effectiveness of early intervention. The Early Intervention Project (‘Vroegtijdige Interventie Project, VIP) compares the effect of traditional infant physiotherapy (TIP) with a new family-centered intervention program (COPCA) in children at risk of developmental motor disorder. The aim of this project is to compare postural control during reaching of VIP-children with that of healthy infants. Specific attention was paid to the effect of CP and the type of intervention. Thirteen six-month-old children were included in this explorative study. Reaches in supine and sitting position were recorded on video. Activity of arm-, leg-, neck- and trunk muscles was recorded with EMG. The following parameters were calculated: 1) the prime-mover, the first arm muscle <b>activated,</b> 2) <b>percentage</b> direction specific trials at neck-, trunk- and trial level, 3) the dorsal activation pattern and 4) recruitment order. The results of the VIP-group were compared with those of healthy peers present in the literature. The results showed no clear differences between the VIP-group and healthy infants. The VIP-group showed large variability, just like healthy children. Both groups showed a similar degree of direction-specificity at trunk- and trial level and a clear preference for the so-called complete pattern. However, the VIP-group had no prime-mover preference and a somewhat higher prevalence of direction-specificity at neck level. The degree of top-down recruitment was similar to that of healthy infants, but while sitting the VIP-group seemed to have a preference for bottom-up recruitment. Most children who develop CP had a direction-specific postural adjustments. The COPCA-group had better results while sitting than the TIP-group. No conclusions about the development of postural control and the effect of intervention can be drawn on the basis of this explorative study. More standardized research with more participants is needed. ...|$|R

Because immune responses are controlled by regulatory mechanisms, we also reasoned that the post-stroke immunosuppression would involve T regulatory cells.

B and CD 4 T lymphocytes in initial, adherent, and non-adherent cell fraction were identified by flow cytometry. B lymphocytes of all the younger subjects combined had a higher adherence to activated HUVEC compared with B lymphocytes of the adult donors. Except for greater adherence of HLA-DR+ CD 4 T cells, lymphocytes of children with JRA showed no enhanced adhesion to either unactivated or <b>activated</b> HUVEC. The <b>percentage</b> of B cells adherent to activated HUVEC {{in each of the}} subject groups was 1. 5 - 3. 6 -fold higher than adherent CD 4 T lymphocytes.

40|$|The exuberant immunoinflammatory {{response}} that {{is associated with}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is the major source of the morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Previous studies have established that an exoproduct of P. aeruginosa (exoenzyme S) is a mitogen for human T lymphocytes and <b>activates</b> a larger <b>percentage</b> of T cells than most superantigens, which may contribute to the immunoinflammatory response. An animal model would facilitate studies of the pathophysiologic consequences of this activation. As a first step toward developing an animal model, the murine lymphocyte response to exoenzyme S was examined. When stimulated with exoenzyme S, splenocytes isolated from naive mice entered S phase and proliferated. The optimum response occurred after 2 to 3 days in culture, at 4 × 105 cells per well and 5. 0 μg of exoenzyme S per ml. The response was not due to lipopolysaccharide, since Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A antagonist did not block the response. Other preparations of exoenzyme S stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, since the response to recombinant exoenzyme S (rHisExo S) cloned from strain 388 was similar to the response to exoenzyme S from strain DG 1. There was evidence that genetic variability influenced the response, since A/J, CBA/J, and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were high responders and BALB/cJ mice were low responders following stimulation with exoenzyme S. Both splenic T and B lymphocytes entered the cell cycle in response to exoenzyme S. Thus, murine lymphocytes, like human lymphocytes, respond to P. aeruginosa exoenzyme S, which supports the development of a murine model that may facilitate our understanding of the role that exoenzyme S plays in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients...|$|R

The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the performances of a new eight channel steering-DBS lead and compare this with a conventional cylindrical contact (CC) lead. The two leads were evaluated in a finite element electric field model combined with multicompartment neuron and axon models, representing the internal capsule (IC) fibers and subthalamic nucleus (STN) cells. We defined the optimal stimulation setting as the configuration that <b>activated</b> the highest <b>percentage</b> of STN cells, without activating any IC fibers. With this criterion, we compared monopolar stimulation using a single contact of the steering-DBS lead and CC lead, on three locations and four orientations of the lead. In addition, we performed a current steering test case by dividing the current over two contacts with the steering-DBS lead in its worst-case orientation. In most cases, the steering-DBS lead is able to stimulate a significantly higher percentage of STN cells compared to the CC lead using single contact stimulation or using a two contact current steering protocol when there is approximately a 1 mm displacement of the CC lead. The results also show that correct placement and orientation of the lead in the target remains an important aspect in achieving the optimal stimulation outcome. Currently, clinical trials are set up in Europe with a similar design as the steering-DBS lead. Our results illustrate the importance of the orientation of the new steering-DBS lead in avoiding side effects induced by stimulation of IC fibers. Therefore, in clinical trials sufficient attention should be paid to implanting the steering DBS-lead in the most effective orientatio...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Smoke detectors, a critical part of any fire detection system, are employed as safety devices to warn building inhabitants of life threatening particles resulting from combustion. Two types of detectors are currently on the market: ionization and photoelectric. How longevity effects the performance of smoke detectors is a growing concern, not only for industry, but the American citizen as well. To determine longevity effects on the performance of detectors, a testing chamber was designed and constructed to measure the percent obscuration/ft, of smoke particles at the point of detector activation. Three different tests were conducted: smoldering tests using Douglas fir wood and urethane foam as a fuel source, and a flaming fire test using newspaper as the fuel source. A total of three hundred eighty tests were conducted using new, five (5), ten (10), and fifteen (15) year old ionization and photoelectric smoke detectors in an uncleaned and cleaned condition. Comparisons between the detectors performance was analyzed and reviewed. The results indicate that smoke detectors are often unreliable and are inconsistent in their pattern of activating within an acceptable operating range of 0. 5 % - 4. 0 % obscuration/ft. This study indicates that fifteen (15) year old detectors generally <b>activate</b> at a <b>percentage</b> exceeding 4. 0 % obscuration/ft., or often do not activate. Because of this finding and the fact that homeowners tend to not replace detectors once they are installed, further investigation into the causes for this shortcoming is warranted.

40|$|The lung, {{like most}} other organs, is {{susceptible}} to injury by circulating immune complexes, and also by humoral autoantibody and immune lymphocytes which specifically recognize selected lung antigens. In addition, {{by virtue of its}} direct communication with the external environment, the lung can also be injured by inhaled environmental agents which trigger inflammatory reactions mediated by immune effector systems. Although major emphasis to date has been placed on the ability of inhaled antigens to first sensitize, then provoke, immunologically specific reactions in the lung, there is increasing evidence to show that these same immune effector systems are also triggered in an immunologically nonspecific fashion by a certain environmental agents (termed "mitogens") which activate leukocytes in a polyclonal fashion. Such agents include certain viruses and other microorganisms, bacterial endotoxin, a wide variety of plant lectins, and certain chemicals, such as the phorbol esters. Although such agents act in an immunologically nonspecific fashion, they are nonetheless quite specific from a chemical viewpoint, and in many cases act by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface. By activating macrophages directly, and by <b>activating</b> much larger <b>percentages</b> of a given lymphocyte population than do specific antigens, they induce correspondingly amplified inflammatory reactions in vivo. Recent studies with animal models indicate that inhaled mitogens are strikingly effective in inducing pulmonary inflammation, whereas inhaled antigens (lacking mitogenic activity) produce little if any parenchymal injury in immunized recipients, unless administered in conjunction with a mitogen. Ongoing studies using such models promise to provide valuable new insight into the biologic properties which govern the pathogenicity of inhaled environmental agents, the mediators they release, and the biochemical basis for variations in individual susceptibility to injury by such agents...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a rapid dielectrophoretic characterization tool for monitoring leukocyte activation, and its application for monitoring sepsis progression. Sepsis is an uncontrolled activation of the immune system that causes an excessive inflammatory response or an impaired immunity. The unpredictable immune status makes the immunotherapy treatment difficult. One crucial aspect of sepsis is leukocyte activation, which {{plays an important role in}} the attacking the pathogens, stimulating the tissues, and resulting in organ function failures. Monitoring leukocyte activation in sepsis may provide real-time indicators for diagnosis, prognosis, and guiding therapy. To measure leukocyte activation, we used Iso-dielectric Separation (IDS) and dielectrohporetic spring (DEP spring) method which can rapid characterize of thousands of cells to provide statistically meaningful results. To adapt to measuring septic blood with clumpy and sticky leukocytes, the double-sided electrodes was developed and characterized for higher throughput and anti-fouling measurement. The human neutrophils were successfully isolated and activated with chemicals and their electrical properties were measured across many conditions and compared to the non-activated ones. We found repeatable and consistent electrical changes using both IDS and DEP spring method: an increase in effective conductivity of activated neutrophils at higher frequencies (above 5 MHz). We then developed an electrical model and an experiment pipeline of inhibiting neutrophil functions to hypothesize the underlying mechanism. Using the blood samples from a cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis in mice, we estimated the number of activated leukocytes by looking into the difference in electrical properties at 10 MHz. We found that the <b>activated</b> leukocyte <b>percentage</b> correlated with the neutrophil activation percentage obtained from flow cytometry, indicating potential use for monitoring sepsis progression. We designed a multi-parametric time series experiment to understand the prognostic value of leukocyte activation and the role of leukocyte activation in sepsis at a system level. We found that the neutrophil activation percentage of non-survivors were significantly larger than survivors at 24 hours after the CLP procedure. We also found the neutrophil activation percentage positively correlates with inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 6 and interleukin- 10. Finally, we initiated a pilot study of monitoring neutrophil activation in critically-ill human patients with suspected sepsis. We found, with a limited dataset, the effective conductivity of neutrophils in critically-ill human patients is higher than the healthy control. To show the feasibility of becoming an point-of-care bedside device, the sample preparation of red blood cell removal was integrated in for rapid test that can profile > 1, 000 leukocytes within 15 minutes from sample to result, providing a simple assay to monitor leukocyte activation in sepsis progression. by Hao-Wei Su.

40|$|All peritoneal {{macrophage}} (pMΦ) populations studied exhibited some binding of the anti-asGM 1 serum as {{assessed by}} flow cytometry. The levels of reactivity varied quantitatively among populations, {{depending on the}} combination of eliciting and activating agents employed prior to the harvest of pMΦ. Resident pMΦ contained {{a very small percentage}} (4 %) of cells that were strongly asGM 1 +. Any treatment of these cells that induced them to become stimulated or <b>activated</b> increased the <b>percentage</b> of highly asGM 1 + cells. Treatments that enhanced anti-asGM 1 binding including eliciting pMΦ with proteose peptone (16 % asGM 1 +) or Brewer's thioglycollate medium (66 % asGM 1 +), treatment with the activating biological response modifiers (BRMs) MVE- 2 (12 % asGM 1 +) and P acnes (18 % asGM 1 +), or treatment with both peptone + MVE- 2 (37 % asGM 1 +) or peptone + poly IC/LC (33 %). Increased expression of anti-asGM 1 was accompanied by some increase in the reactivity of the various pMΦ populations to treatment with anti-asGM 1 serum. This conclusion was based on the reduced viabilities of cells treated with both an eliciting agent and an activating agent prior to in vitro treatment with anti-asGM 1 + C, as well as by reductions in cytolytic activity of pMΦ elicited with peptone and activated by MVE- 2, following anti-asGM 1 treatment in vitro or administration in vivo. Conversely, the cytolytic activity of resident pMΦ activated in vivo by MVE- 2 or heat-killed P acnes, agents that induced relatively small increases in the percentage of asGM 1 + cells, was resistant to the effects of in vivo and/or in vitro treatment with doses of anti-asGM 1 serum that inhibit NK activity. These results indicate that stimulation of pMΦ by eliciting or activating agents can increase the level of expression of asGM 1. This increased expression of asGM 1 may be a useful marker for some aspects of macrophage heterogeneity, but increased expression is not necessarily directly related to expression of tumoricidal activity. In fact, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that anti-asGM 1 serum can be used for specific depletion of NK activity in vivo in normal mice and in mice treated with at least some BRMs. However, the results also demonstrate that the use of eliciting agents, particularly thioglycollate, or eliciting agents in conjunction with activating agents can cause pMΦ to become reactive with anti-asGM 1 serum...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveScreening for {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms (AAAs) reduces aneurysm-related {{mortality and}} has been recommended by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Heart Association since 2005. Medicare has covered a one-time screening ultrasound for new male enrollees with a familial or smoking history since 2007. Nevertheless, in the U. S., screening has remained underutilized. Review of patients with ruptured AAA in our system in 2007 showed the majority were undiagnosed, yet met U. S. Preventive Services Task Force and American Heart Association screening guidelines. To {{reduce the number of}} preventable AAA ruptures and deaths in our patients, we implemented an AAA screening program using our electronic medical record (EMR). This study describes the design, implementation, and early results of that screening program. MethodsBetween March 2012 and June 2013, men aged 65 to 75  years with any history of smoking were targeted for screening. Medical records were reviewed electronically to exclude patients with abdominal imaging studies within 10  years that would have diagnosed an AAA. Best practice alerts (BPA) were created in the EMR so when an appropriate patient is seen, office staff and providers are prompted to order an aortic ultrasound. AAA was defined as aortic diameter ≥ 3. 0  cm or greater, and ultrasound reports contained a standard template providing guidance for patient management when an aneurysm was identified. Newly identified AAAs were triaged for vascular surgery consultation or follow-up with their primary physician. The number of eligible patients, unscreened patients, and AAAs identified were tabulated by our Regional Outpatient Safety Net Program. ResultsIn a population of 3. 6 million, 55, 610 patients initially met screening criteria, and 26, 837 (48. 26 %) were excluded from the BPA because of prior abdominal imaging studies. After 15  months, there were 68, 164 patients who met screening criteria, 54, 356 (79. 74 %) of whom had undergone an abdominal imaging study. Thus, 27, 519 patients underwent an imaging study after the BPA was activated. During the study period, 731 new AAAs were diagnosed, 165 over 4. 0  cm in diameter. Screening rates have increased at all medical centers where the BPA was <b>activated,</b> and the <b>percentage</b> of unscreened patients has been reduced from 51. 74 % to 20. 26 % system-wide. ConclusionsIn an integrated health care system using an EMR, AAA screening can be implemented with a dramatic reduction in unscreened patients. Further analysis is required {{to assess the impact of}} the screening program on AAA rupture rate and cost-effectiveness in our system...|$|R
40|$|In der Arbeit wurde die Rolle von Bakterien für das Entstehen von Autoimmunität untersucht. Insbesondere wurde untersucht, inwieweit Bakterien entweder spezifisch (über "Kreuzreaktivität") oder antigenunabhängig (über "Bystander-Aktivierung") eine Aktivierung von autoreaktiven CD 4 +- T-Zellen induzieren können. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass es bei dem untersuchten, MBP-spezifischen T-Zellrezeptor multiple, natürlich vorkommende, kreuzreaktive Peptide mikrobiellen Ursprungs gibt, die eine Aktivierung der T-Zellen hervorrufen und in vivo experimentelle {{autoimmune}} Enzephalomyelitis (EAE) induzieren können. Weiterhin wurde untersucht, inwieweit Lipopolysaccharid (LPS) als unspezifischer Aktivator des Immunsystems eine Aktivierung der autoreaktiven T-Zellen {{in vitro}} hervorrufen kann und inwieweit in vivo EAE durch LPS hervorgerufen werden kann. Es wurde gezeigt, dass LPS in vitro einen kleinen Anteil der CD 4 + - T-Zellen aktiviert. Wurden den transgenen T+alpha- -Mäusen LPS appliziert, erkrankten diese an EAE. Somit gibt es sowohl in vitro als auch in vivo in den T+alpha- -Mäusen Hinweise für eine Relevanz von "Bystander-Aktivierung". Abschließend wurde diskutiert, inwieweit entweder "Kreuzreaktivität" oder "Bystander-Aktivierung" als Auslöser für Autoimmunität unter physiologischen Bedingungen in Frage kommt. Aufgrund der in dieser Arbeit gezeigten Ergebnisse wurde postuliert, dass keine der beiden Mechanismen alleiniger Auslöser sei, da es aufgrund der Häufigkeit von Infektionen, kreuzreaktiven Peptiden und des Vorkommens von autoreaktiven T-Zellen auch in gesunden Individuen ansonsten sehr viel häufiger zu Autoimmunität kommen müsste. Unter bestimmten Bedingungen könnte die Aktivierung von T-Zellen über Kreuzreaktivität oder über "Bystander-Aktivierung" Autoimmunität auslösen oder verstärken, wenn bereits andere Mechanismen des Immubnsystems, die Autoimmunität verhindern, versagt haben. In this thesis {{the role of}} bacteria for the induction of autoimmunity was investigated. In detail, it was examined whether bacteria are able to activate autoreactive CD 4 +-T-cells antigen-specific ("cross-reactivity") or antigen-unspecific ("bystander-activation"). It was shown that the examined transgenic MBP-peptide specific T-cell-receptor recognized many natural occurring cross-reactive peptides of microbial origin, which induced an activation of the T-cells in vitro and which could induce autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the T-cell-receptor transgenic mice in vivo. Furthermore, it was examined, whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as activator of the innate immune system could induce an unspecific activation of the autoreactive T-cells in vitro and whether administration of LPS in the transgenic mice could induce EAE in vivo. It was shown that LPS <b>activates</b> a small <b>percentage</b> of CD 4 + - T-cells. Application of LPS to the transgenic T+alpha- mice induced EAE. Therefore, the role of bystander-activation was indicated in vitro and in vivo. Finally, it was discussed, whether either cross-reactivity or bystander-activation could be sufficient for inducing autoimmunity under physiologic conditions. Due to the results presented in this work, it is postulated {{that none of the}} both mechanisms could be inductor of autoimmunity alone. If one of these mechanisms was sufficient, autoimmunity in humans should be a frequent event, because infections and autoreactive T cells are both findings which occur in healthy humans very often. However, under certain conditions either cross-reactivity or bystander-activation could trigger or exacerbate autoimmunity, when other mechanisms which inhibit autoimmunity have failed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Chemistry in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyThis study sought to prepare and characterise activated carbons from Vitis vinifera (grape) leaf litter, and assess the efficiency and potential application of the adsorbent {{for the removal of}} four phenolic compounds (phenol (P), 2 -nitrophenol (2 -NP), 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) and 2 -chlorophenol (2 -CP)) from synthetic and industrial wastewaters. Vitis vinifera (grape) leaf litter (GL) was obtained locally, and washed, dried and pulvirized. Chemically activated carbons were prepared using H 3 PO 4 (GLA) and NaOH (GLB). The adsorbents were characterized with SEM, FTIR, EDX and proximate analysis was also carried out. Phenols were extracted from water samples with SPE and analysed with HPLC. The prepared adsorbents were used in sorption of phenols from simulated phenolic wastewaters for optimization of adsorption. Optimal adsorption conditions were then applied for removal of phenols from wastewater samples collected from influents of treatment plants. Column and desorption studies were also carried out. The surface texture and morphology micrographs (using SEM) of the prepared materials/adsorbents showed that the prepared activated carbons possess improved pore structure, cavities and heterogeneous irregular surfaces capable of providing enhanced adsorption. EDX spectroscopy was used for elemental microanalysis and showed that the major constituent of the adsorbent is carbon. FTIR analysis revealed changes and absorption waveband drifts of surface functional groups after activation and adsorption. The proximate analysis of the prepared precursors demonstrated good quality of the active carbons. They had low moisture content (< 12 %) and their inorganic matter content (ash) was less than 9 % for the three sorbents. Iodine number value of the adsorbents was 342, 1065, and 571 mg/g for GL, GLA and GLB respectively. Excellent recoveries (92. 60 – 102. 85 %) were obtained for the phenolic compounds (P, 2 -NP, 4 -NP and 2 -CP) using polymeric SPE cartridges. Phosphoric acid activation yielded the most efficient activated carbon material relative to the non-treated biomass and those chemically <b>activated</b> with NaOH. <b>Percentage</b> removal was 92. 70 %, 99. 92 %, 99. 98 % and 99. 90 % for P, 2 -NP, 4 -NP and 2 -CP respectively using GLA. Optimal pH for adsorption was 8, 4 and 7 for GLA, GLB and GL respectively at an equilibration time of 240 min. The evaluation of adsorption kinetics showed the adsorption process of GLA and GLB followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model while adsorption using GL was best described by intraparticle diffusion model. Adsorption equilibrium data were well fitted with Freundlich isotherm model for all three adsorbents. Adsorption capacity of GLA (for removal of phenols) was found to decrease with increase in temperature. In contrast, the sorption efficiency of GL and GLB increased when temperature was increased. Thermodynamic parameters of adsorption (ΔGo, ΔHo & ΔSo) were evaluated. Results revealed favourability and exothermic nature of adsorption of the phenols using GLA. Adsorption processes using GLB and GL were spontaneous and endothermic. Vitis vinifera leaf litter yielded good activated carbons and was effective in remediation of P, 2 -NP, 4 -NP and 2 -CP from contaminated wastewaters...|$|R
