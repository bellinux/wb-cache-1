5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put up close to the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans for building a station house with <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed out to <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising {{on his hand}} from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as evidence that he had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to help keep him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and overcoats. They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> ambulance.|$|E

Metrovision, the area's economic development chamber, stated that they had secured guarantees for purchasing suites, season tickets and club seating from businesses to the extent that there was <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> list for suites.

Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks. Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody.|$|E

5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E

Myrdal Station was given side tracks and additional buildings to serve transferring passengers, with the upgrades costing NOK0.5 million. Breikvam {{was the only place}} on-route which received a passing loop. Flåm Station cost NOK0.8 million and was designed in the 1930s NSB simple wooden functionalist style, similar to what is found on the Nordland Line and the Sørland Line. Other stations received small, wooden buildings with <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> room, as well as a room for cargo at Vatnahalsen, Håreina and Dalsbotn.|$|E

5|$|The friars {{returned}} in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed {{them in a}} friendly manner, {{but this time the}} Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.|$|E
5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> room, an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} unstaffed, but {{features}} ticket machines, <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> room, kisok and taxicab stand. There is parking nearby {{in a parking}} house. The bus station features two sections, one for local buses and one for regional buses. Between them they have six stops. However, because of the design of European Road E18, the station can only serve buses on the E18 which runs westwards—eastbound buses are served by a bus stop {{on the other side}} of the freeway. Ownership and operation of the bus terminal is carried out by Akershus Kollektivterminaler.|$|E
