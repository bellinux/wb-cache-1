40|$|Background: Medicinal {{plants are}} an {{important}} source of substances which are claimed to induce <b>antimicrobial,</b> antimutagenic and <b>antioxidant</b> effects. Many plants have been used due to their antimicrobial treatments. <b>Antimicrobial</b> and <b>antioxidant</b> activities of L. orientalis have not been reported to the present day. The aim of this work was to investigate of the <b>antimicrobial</b> and <b>antioxidant</b> potentials of different extracts from L. orientalis. Materials and Methods: The extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity against different food pathogens. These bacteria include 4 Gram positive and 3 Gram negative bacteria and one fungi. The leaf extracts of plant were tested by disc diffusion assay. The MIC was evaluated on plant extracts as antimicrobial activity. In addition to, the plant extracts were tested against the stable DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) free-radical. Results: The acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of L. orientalis showed maximum inhibition zone of 12 mm against Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition to, the methanol extract displayed a strong antioxidant activity (trolox equivalent = 2. 23 mM).

In this paper, water extracts from the whole plant, external layer and peeled plant were studied to determine the main components responsible for its biological activities, i. e., its <b>antimicrobial,</b> <b>antioxidant,</b> and anti-tyrosinase activities; its cytotoxicity against mouse melanoma B 16 F 10 cells; and its pro-erectile activity in adult male rats. The results of electron transfer and hydrogen transfer assays showed that the antioxidant activity was mainly due to anthocyanins in the external layer, whereas the external layer and peeled plant extracts both inhibited the microbial growth of several Gram-positive strains. In contrast, the whole plant extract had the highest anti-tyrosinase activity and exhibited pro-erectile activity when administered subcutane-ously.
