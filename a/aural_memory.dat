5000|$|While {{continuing}} in daily use at monasteries and sometimes featuring at funerals for their deep notes sounded at long intervals, {{as well as}} at other services, semantra have also played a part in Orthodox history. Their origin has been traced to at least the beginning of the 6th century, when the semantron had replaced the trumpet as the agent of convocation in the monasteries of Palestine and Egypt, including Saint Catherine's in the Sinai; the rhythms struck on wood were soon vested with the <b>aural</b> <b>memory</b> of rhythmic blasts from earlier trumpets, an iconography of trumpeting that was eventually transferred to the zvon of Russian bells. The joy shown at Constantinople {{on the occasion of the}} translation of the relics of St. Anastasius was shown by the beating of xyla. In the Life of St. Theodosius the Archimandrite, by John Moschus, one reads of some Eutychian monks of the party of Severus who, to disturb the saint at his devotion, [...] "beat the wood" [...] at an unwonted hour. St. Sabas rose for his devotions [...] "before the hour of striking." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} whether the quality of students' writing was affected by three types of word processor enhancements, namely, formatting characters, applying borders or annotating with voice. A team of evaluators independently scored three sets of writing assignments which were collected from 30 grade 7 students over a period of 39 weeks. An analysis of the data revealed no statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. The quality of writing was not affected by the type of word processor enhancements used during the composing and revising processes. The results of the study with these writers showed that 1) the research subjects did not possess sufficient knowledge of what could be expected from using the enhancements or the requisite skills to use the enhancements to affect the quality of their writing; 2) the constructivist writing model, along with the associated generative strategies which were employed with this group, were likely insufficient to effect a significant improvement in writing quality and, 3) a counterbalanced or repeated measures-by-treatment assessment should not have been used due to contamination of <b>aural</b> <b>memory</b> traces from speech to visual conditions. Limitations and implications of the study for further research are identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to ponder the {{reception}} of the Letter to the Galatians in an aural setting. How did the first recipients react, what can we expect that they remembered after having listened to the letter? Are there structural elements in the letter that would have aided the aural reception of the letter? In four readings, the investigation traces textual indicators of interaction and emotion, compares their locations with epistolary and rhetorical structure-analysis and identifies a structure of persuasion. The focus on listeners is motivated by the supposition that illiteracy was the rule rather than the exception among those to whom the letter to the Galatians was sent. The different readings reveal a structure of persuasion with a realistic prospect to succeed as a mnemonic device in an aural setting on a macro-structural level. Situational passages (1 : 6 - 10; 3 : 1 - 5; 4 : 8 - 20; 5 : 2 - 12 and 6 : 12 - 13), together with recurring affirmations of Christ and Paul as embodiments of faithfulness and commitment in suffering, imprint on the <b>aural</b> <b>memory</b> of the first listeners a concern for an imitatio Christi crucifixi...|$|E
40|$|Through interrelating the Acoustic Communication {{concepts}} of soundscape with contemporary collective memory studies, this research project explores {{the relationship between}} commuters and the London Underground (LU) soundscape {{in order to create}} an interactive sonic environment on the Internet. The methodology combines fieldwork and artistic work, focusing on commuters’ perceptions of time and space, and on their sonic memories, as elements through which to interpret the space. The objective of the fieldwork is to investigate commuters’ <b>aural</b> <b>memories</b> of the LU soundscape, including the feelings and sensations that it stimulates. The artistic objective is to facilitate the interaction between the soundscape and its users through an interface that allows a creative combination of sounds to assemble <b>aural</b> <b>memories</b> into a sound-driven multimedia experience. Twenty-four commuters participated in the ethnographic study during the three phases of the research; they followed the researcher’s model, which combines the processes of listening and remembering. The researcher thus developed an interactive sonic environment where commuters can experience a non-linear virtual journey through the soundscape of LU, then apply this as a means of reflecting on the original commuting experience. The interactive nature of the process makes it possible for individual memories to be linked in a creative shared experience; it fosters the development of on-line sound-driven narratives.

40|$|International audienceThrough artistic means, this {{research}} {{deals with the}} notion of 'Auditory Spatial Awareness' as initially developed by Barry Blesser and Linda-Ruth Salter in "Spaces Speak are you listening, experiencing aural architecture" published at the MIT press in 2007. By exploring our capacity of capturing an emotional and behavioral experience of ourselves and our space through sound, this investigation raises questions about the resonance, the orientation, and the expansion of the body's limits through sound in space. "Auditory Spatial Awareness in Action" is staged in urban spaces and more specifically in "non-spaces" (Augé, 1992). It reveals itself to be not only a search for our memory through sound but also the experience of an <b>aural</b> spatial <b>memory...</b>|$|R
40|$|Children from {{preschool}} to {{fifth grade}} were given two independent series of language tasks. The first tested <b>aural</b> sentence <b>memory</b> and {{was designed to}} assess children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to exploit syntactic structure and semantic cohesion to facilitate sentence recall. The second tested children 2 ̆ 7 s syntactic awareness, as reflected {{in their ability to}} correct grammatically deviant sentences. Results showed increases with grade level both in children 2 ̆ 7 s syntactic awareness and in their use of linguistic structure in sentence recall. Further, syntactic awareness increased with age, independently of vocabulary age. Syntactic awareness was significantly related both to reading achievement and to the use of syntactic structure and semantic structure to facilitate sentence recall, even with the effects of vocabulary age and grade statistically controlled. Although strongly correlated with verbal ability, syntactic awareness appears to constitute a higher-order language skill that is associated with other aspects of verbal performance...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [83]- 86) Instrumental {{music education}} is performance-based, stressing development of reading skills and technique. These skills {{do not produce}} aural cognition. We assume students hear what they play. This is not true. Learning becomes a repetitive drill to duplicate written parts. This is visual learning of an aural language, producing an obvious gap between technical skills and aural cognition. Improvisation involves aural cognitive functions of the mind. It is not taught {{due to the lack}} of understanding of these functions. It needs to be included early in instrumental methodology to provide students with an aural cognitive process. Performance-based pedagogy defines the way students comprehend music. Students acquire musical skills using repetitive techniques, believing that immersion in physical effort will attain results. Instrumentalists do not know how to practice because they do not know what to practice. They have no process. Very young children are spontaneous. College-level students are reluctant to perform individually. They are not afraid of performance; they are afraid of making a mistake. Their individuality has been converted to controlled fear, resulting from the early emphasis given to reading correctly and constant group participation. Various memorization techniques are used to reproduce music. These techniques do not equip students with any practical skills (other than reading) to continue with music after they leave the school system. Acquiring performance skills involves simultaneous cognitive, affective, and psychomotor activities. Interaction of these skills is crucial. One passes from novice to expert as the ability to combine these activities becomes proficient. Creativity is a behavior that may involve systematic inference, trial-and-error experimentation, change of existing models, or emotional interpretation. These activities can occur simultaneously or separately. We are predisposed to <b>aural</b> <b>memory.</b> Our brain unconsciously scans everything we hear. Recognizing and elevating this process is central to improvisation. College-level, non-music major instrumentalists and one music major participated in various tasks designed to understand the aural processes involved in performing improvised music. Conclusions stress the need for an aural learning process to be used as a basis for all activities at the beginning of instrumental instruction. Recommendations include a rethinking of curricula include improvisation at all levels. M. Mus. (Master of Music...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the cultural meanings of recent revivals in Yiddish {{music in the}} USA and central Europe. It does this with reference to Adorno's critique of lyrical celebration of the past {{as a means of}} forgetting. It examines the criticisms that recent 'Jewish' cultural revivals are kitsch forms of unreflective nostalgia and considers the complexity of meanings here. It then explores the ways in which klezmer might be an <b>aural</b> form of <b>memory</b> and suggests that revivals can represent gateways into personal and collective engagement with the past. It further argues that experimental hybrid forms of new klezmer potentially open new spaces of remembrance and expressions of Jewish identity. Â© The Author(s) 2010...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} and tolerance of tanakan {{in the treatment}} of mild cognitive impairment in young patients. Patients and methods. The study enrolled 30 patients whose mean age was 33. 5 ± 7. 5 years. It used clinical neurological examination; a test for rating general condition, activity, and mood; studies to evaluate aural short-term and verbal short-term memories and to estimate the level of attention using Schulte's tables, and questionnaires for the rating of autonomic disorders and nocturnal sleep quality, those for the patient subjective assessment of treatment efficiency and for the recording of adverse reactions. Results. Tanakan therapy led to the normalized emotional status in the patients, improved nocturnal sleep, and reduced autonomic disorders. There was a tendency towards improvement of all characteristics of attention. <b>Aural</b> and verbal <b>memories</b> became better. Conclusion. Tanakan is an effective and safe drug to treat cognitive impairment at any age. </p...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on 14 {{months of}} ethnographic {{research}} in Dakar, Senegal {{as well as}} an 18 -month focused case study with Senegalese rappers in Los Angeles, this dissertation explores Senegalese hip hop production as the performative negotiation of postcolonial urban space. Engaging tradition as a discursive strategy, it considers hip hop tracks as <b>aural</b> palimpsest <b>memories</b> that are constructed through practices of lyrical, discursive, linguistic, and musical intertextuality, practices that strategically layer invented traditions of local performance and U. S. hip hop. Although scholarly and popular media accounts of Senegalese hip hop privilege internationally successful rappers' narratives of hip hop as stemming from local griot traditions, the "underground" majority of rappers rejects this narrative to instead ground their music in hip hop's mythologized history of racialized socio-economic struggle. Through hip hop-mediated understandings of similitude between African American and Senegalese urban experience, they strategically and self-consciously position themselves within an alternative, globally articulating modernity and against a local, traditionally inflected one. In positing hip hop production as the (re) production of memory, I argue against hybridity as a potentially colonizing framework to insist instead on an analysis grounded in local narratives that erase hybridity's prerequisite difference. Depending on their positionality vis-à-vis local and international markets, Senegalese rappers position hip hop either as always already indigenous, or as necessarily and definitely black American. In the processes and products of hip hop production, they draw on multiple mythologized pasts, creating interlocking, performative narratives of sameness and historicity through which they negotiate situated experiences of modernity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new, {{data-driven}} mapping of five ACT-R modules on the brain. In the last decade, many studies have been published that evaluated ACT-R models based {{on their ability to}} predict fMRI data in certain predefined brain regions. However, these predefined regions were based on a reading of the literature, and might not be optimal. Currently, we used the results of a model-based fMRI analysis of five datasets to define a new brain mapping for the problem state, declarative memory, manual, visual, and aural modules. Both the original and the new mapping were applied to data of an experiment that elicited differential activity in these five modules; the results were compared to model predictions. The new mapping performed slightly better for the problem state, declarative <b>memory,</b> <b>aural,</b> and manual modules, but not for the visual module. In addition, it provides a more principled way of validating ACT-R models. Although the mapping is ACT-R specific, the methodology can be use to map any cognitive architecture or model to the brain...|$|R

There is an important amount of studies on this subject related to several school curriculum areas. Although, {{this is not the}} case in music education, despite the visual helps might have the potential to facilitate <b>aural</b> discrimination and <b>memory</b> by means of associative processes, as well as the enhancement of motor skills. This study have tried to discover if there is an effect of unimodal presentation mode (three exclusive modes) versus bimodal presentation mode (two crossed modes) in the reproduction of musical rhythm patterns. To do this, two experiments were carried out with Middle School children in Valencia, Spain. In the first experiment (N 50; 21 boys; 29 girls; 14 - 16 years old) a contrast pretest-posttest design was adopted. Subjects were grouped in five conditions, each having information in one different mode: only static images (I) flashing the rhythm according to the proposed rhythm patterns; only sounds (A); only on-screen texts (T) that represented the rhythm pattern when reading; sounds and static images together (AV) and sounds and texts together (AT). In the second experiment a repeated measures design was adopted (N= 10; 3 boys and 7 girls; 16 - 18 years old). Each subject had to do the tests in all experimental conditions aforementioned. Some intervening variables were measured: previous rhythm skills, previous musical experiences, school achievement of last year, preferences on modes {{of information}} presentation and gender. Test tasks were to hear in turn 10 proposed rhythm patterns, memorized them, and imitate them by means of a computer key. The computer ran an ad hoc computer program that provided stimuli, data gathering and assessment of responses. Results of both experiments show statistical differences in favor of groups AV, AT (bimodal) and A (unimodal). It is suggested the advantage of presenting rhythm information with sound together with other means in the teaching and learning music processes...|$|R
