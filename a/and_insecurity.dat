5|$|Mildred Walpole {{found it}} hard to settle in New Zealand, and {{something}} of her restlessness <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> affected the character of her eldest child. In 1889, two years after the birth of the couple's daughter, Dorothea ("Dorothy"), Somerset Walpole accepted a prominent and well-paid academic post at the General Theological Seminary, New York. Robert ("Robin"), the third of the couple's children, was born in New York in 1892. Hugh and Dorothy were taught by a governess until the middle of 1893, when the parents decided that he needed an English education.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had been pushed to their {{emotional}} limits. Long separations had exacerbated his natural feelings of inadequacy <b>and</b> <b>insecurity.</b> As a product of a childhood that could well be described as a series of losses, he was extremely dependent on his wife's love and encouragement. For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|On the {{national}} level, sanctions and suspension of donor aid amounting to 50 percent of {{the national}} budget and 70 percent of public investments obstructed the Rajoelina administration's management of state affairs and its ability to systematically combat poverty on a wider scale. A United Nations envoy concluded in 2011 that Rajoelina's controversial accession to the presidency had reduced food security, with Madagascar ranking among the worst in the world for child nutrition. The frequent non-payment of civil servant and military salaries resulted in regular school and hospital closures, general strikes and widespread increases in corruption. Crime <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> grew dramatically, with a sharp upswing in violent crime and theft in Antananarivo and increasingly frequent and deadly incidences of armed cattle rustling in the central southern region of the island. Key development indicators steeply declined between 2009 and 2013, including maternal and child mortality, education enrollment and completion, per capita income and employment rates. In 2010 the United Nations ranked Madagascar among the ten poorest countries in the world, noting that economic gains made under Ravalomanana had been lost following Rajoelina's unconstitutional rise to power. In 2011, Forbes magazine ranked Madagascar as the worst economy in the world, faulting its political instability and poor governance.|$|E

From the 13th century Jews were required to wear identifying clothes such as special hats or stars on their clothing.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of this literature reflected the increasing feeling of anxiety <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> as international tensions between European Imperial powers escalated towards {{the outbreak of}} the First World War. Across the decades the nationality of the invaders tended to vary, according to the most acutely perceived threat at the time. In the 1870s the Germans were the most common invaders. Towards {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, a period of strain on Anglo-French relations, and the signing of a treaty between France and Russia, the French became the more common menace.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{perceived}} external employability (PEE) as {{a personal}} resource in relation to job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion. We advance the idea that PEE may reduce feelings of job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and,</b> through felt job insecurity, also exhaustion. That is, we probe the paths from PEE to job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> from job <b>insecurity</b> to exhaustion. We furthermore account for possible reversed causality, so that exhaustion * felt job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> felt job <b>insecurity</b> * PEE. This aligns with insights from the Conservation of Resources. Theory, which is built on the assumption of resource caravans passageways and associated gain and loss spirals. We based the results on a sample of 1314 workers from two Finnish universities. Respondents participated twice in the study with a time lag of one year. We found that PEE related negatively to felt job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. Similarly, there was a reciprocal positive relationship between felt job <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> exhaustion. We conclude that PEE may prevent feelings of <b>insecurity</b> <b>and,</b> through reduced job insecurity, also exhaustion. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Under the JG, {{people of}} working age {{who are not}} in {{full-time}} education and have less than 35 hours per week of paid employment would be entitled to the balance of 35 hours paid employment, undertaking work of public benefit at the minimum wage. The aim is to replace unemployment and underemployment with paid employment (up to the hours desired by workers), so that those who are at any point in time surplus to the requirements of the private sector (and mainstream public sector) can earn a reasonable living rather than suffer the indignity <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> of underemployment, poverty, and social exclusion.|$|E

The law was unpopular; and several protesters from rural areas, fought against federal troops in {{what became known as the}} Cristero War. After the war's end in 1929, President Emilio Portes Gil upheld a previous truce where the law would remain enacted, but not enforced, in exchange for the hostilities to end.|$|E

40|$|Over 17 million food-insecure {{households}} {{are associated with}} increasing obesity rates across the United States. Although food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> obesity are distinct social concerns, the two are linked and {{may be influenced by}} poverty and geographic location. Public health authorities and state leaders responsible for the health and nutrition of rural populations in particular would benefit from this information. The purpose of this quantitative cross-sectional study was to examine whether poverty mediated the relationship between food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> obesity among urban and rural adults. The study was guided by the poverty, food <b>insecurity,</b> <b>and</b> obesity conceptual framework. The study addressed the association between poverty <b>and</b> food <b>insecurity,</b> poverty <b>and</b> obesity, <b>and</b> food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> obesity. Records from 9068 participants in the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) were weighted to represent the population of Louisiana. Logistic regression models indicated that individuals living in poverty were 6 times more likely to experience food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> that living in poverty and being food insecure doubled the odds of being obese. Poverty mediates the relationship between food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> obesity in a dynamic and complex manner. Findings also indicated gender and age differences in rates of obesity, poverty, <b>and</b> food <b>insecurity,</b> as well as higher rates of obesity in rural populations. Social change implications include providing additional evidence of how poverty affects food <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> obesity, which may encourage states with high poverty rates to initiate food insecurity surveillance using BRFSS to reduce obesity...|$|R
25|$|Business {{regulations}} have been overhauled along liberal lines, especially since 1999. Most {{barriers to the}} flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult {{over the past decade}} due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> and vehement corruption. This can be confirmed by the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index report degrading its ratings for Pakistan each year since September 2009 when it ranked Pakistan (at 85th) well ahead of neighbours like China (at 89th) and India (at 133rd).|$|E
25|$|Consequently, intense {{feelings}} of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may {{always seem to}} be present, {{as much as it is}} actually present and experienced from past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears <b>and</b> <b>insecurity</b> keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generations, thus making genetics as one of the components of the causes of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.|$|E
