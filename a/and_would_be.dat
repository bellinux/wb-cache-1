5|$|The Australian {{government}} announced in July 2007 that a 135,000-hectare (334,000-acre) national park was being created in northern Queensland <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> named the Steve Irwin Wildlife Reserve.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Stewart wrote {{a history}} of the New Zealand Division, which was {{published}} in 1921 <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the main reference work for this formation for several decades. He resumed his teaching career at Canterbury College but in 1926 returned to England, as a Professor of Latin at the University of Leeds. In 1929, he became the principal of University College of Nottingham. He died suddenly in 1934 while in transit to England after a holiday in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|Pools {{were based}} on the current world rankings (January 4, 2011). Teams ranked 1, 4, 5 <b>and</b> 8 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in Pool A, while teams ranked 2, 3, 6 <b>and</b> 7 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in Pool B.|$|R
5000|$|On 23 February, Izetbegović {{said that}} there was {{essentially}} no more Yugoslavia, and {{that there will be a}} [...] "triple level federation" [...] instead: Slovenia <b>and</b> Croatia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> independent, Serbia <b>and</b> Montenegro <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in the core of the new state, and BiH <b>and</b> Macedonia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in between, with BiH much closer to Serbia than to Croatia. Izetbegović was heavily attacked by public opinion, claiming that he had given BiH to Milošević.|$|R
60|$|A {{bridge that}} <b>would</b> <b>be</b> high enough <b>and</b> long enough <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very costly, <b>and</b> it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an {{undertaking}} with which Harry could not concern himself, {{no matter what}} it might cost.|$|R
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|As Brezhnev {{replaced}} Khrushchev {{as the new}} General Secretary of the Communist Party, he held ultimate {{political authority}} {{as the leader of}} the Soviet Union. However, he shared collective leadership with Nikolai Podgorny (the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and nominal head of state) and Alexsei Kosygin, the Premier. Brezhnev soon would maximize his grip on power <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the dominating authority in the collective leadership.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} {{previous}} season finished, striker Sean Rooney {{announced that he would}} be leaving Bengaluru FC to join NPL Victoria side Oakleigh Cannons FC. Bengaluru FC CEO, Parth Jindal also announced that Robin Singh, Sunil Chhetri and Thoi Singh would be joining the Indian Super League <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> loaned back to Bengaluru FC when the season was over.

50|$|The {{fight was}} {{declared}} a draw. The {{rules for the}} fight stipulated that rounds 1 <b>and</b> 3 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fought with K-1 rules, and rounds 2 <b>and</b> 4 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fought under MMA rules. There were no judges for this fight.|$|R

5|$|Baldwin {{blocked the}} speech, {{saying that it}} would shock many people <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a grave breach of {{constitutional}} principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people's support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual. Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.|$|E
5|$|Betances {{accompanied}} {{the couple in}} Prévost's return to his country, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> under their indirect tutelage while boarding at the school. He showed interest in natural and exact sciences early on, and also became a good fencer.|$|E
5|$|British Airways later {{published}} {{a list of}} 221 flights of the contaminated aircraft, involving around 33,000 passengers, and advised those potentially affected to contact the UK Department of Health for help.

50|$|A {{total of}} seven Riley & Scott-built Northstar LMP <b>and</b> Northstar LMP01s <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built, while a further three Northstar LMP02s <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built. Team Cadillac <b>and</b> DAMS <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the only teams {{to run the}} cars.|$|R

5000|$|That by {{substitution}} of imprisonment for {{life for the}} death penalty, convictions <b>and</b> punishments <b>would</b> <b>be</b> rendered far more certain, <b>and</b> thereby crime <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lessened, <b>and</b> all the purposes of punishment be accomplished.|$|R
5|$|By 1918, El Camino Sierra {{had been}} {{included}} in the Blue Book, an early road atlas of the United States.

5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
5|$|Design of {{the bridge}} was awarded to Aas-Jakobsen and Det Norske Veritas, the former who also {{performed}} dynamic analysis and structural engineering. Architects were Hindhammer–Sundt–Thomassen, Lund & Løvseth, and Lund & Slaatto. An H pylon was chosen instead of an A pylon both because it was more functional, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more aesthetic {{in conjunction with the}} other bridges in the area, particularly three suspension bridges.|$|E
25|$|After Perryville, Adams <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{replaced}} by Colonel Robert Crittenden of Coffee County, who <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> captured at Nashville. Other regimental officers included: Isaac Corn, James Dunklin, John Crosby, A.N. Moore and Willis Milner. Adams <b>and</b> Moore <b>would</b> <b>be</b> killed in battle, Crosby would die of natural causes, Dunklin <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wounded, <b>and</b> Crittenden <b>would</b> <b>be</b> captured.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} megastructure would incorporate all of Earth's matter. Sunlight {{would enter}} through two large windows, <b>and</b> gravity <b>would</b> <b>be</b> simulated by the centrifugal effect. Humans would live on two vast regions that {{face each other}} and that are connected through the empty center. The hydrosphere <b>and</b> atmosphere <b>would</b> <b>be</b> retained on its inside. The ecosphere <b>would</b> <b>be</b> restricted to the equatorial zones, while at the low-gravity tropic zones a thin atmosphere would allow only for plantations. The polar regions would have neither gravity nor atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>would</b> therefore <b>be</b> used for storage of raw materials and microgravity production processes.|$|R

5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast. German forces in that area were very weak <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected to withdraw rather than fight if the Allies landed there. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, quickly planned a third landing, codenamed Slapstick, {{to take advantage of}} the offer.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{commercial}} broadcasters {{would be}} required to provide minimum levels of high definition content, {{would be required}} to pay fees if they chose to provide datacast services <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> prohibited from using their spectrum for multichanneling of subscription services. In addition, the prohibition on new free-to-air broadcasters would be extended until December 2008.|$|E
5|$|I {{know why}} the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,When he beats his bars <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings— I {{know why the}} caged bird sings.|$|E
50|$|Principal {{photography}} on {{the film}} began on December 1, 2015 in New York City.
