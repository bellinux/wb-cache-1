5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Christian life, stressed Escrivá, is divine filiation: Christians are children of God, identified with Christ's life and mission. Other main features of Opus Dei, according to its official literature, are: freedom, respecting choice and taking personal responsibility; and charity, love of God above all <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> others.|$|E
5|$|Amazon river dolphins, {{known by}} the natives as the boto or encantados, are very {{prevalent}} in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability, their seductiveness <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> sex, often resulting in illegitimate children, and their attraction to parties. Despite {{the fact that the}} Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.|$|E
5|$|Belle's {{strength}} <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> {{reading was}} inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film Little Women (1933), while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance. However, the story artists and animators often disagreed with Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly.|$|E

5|$|Miller's character, {{joie de vivre}} <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> cricket were {{expressed}} on the field during the tour, particularly in the tour games, when he played several carefree innings, hitting many sixes. He also showed his disdain for Bradman's obsession with annihilating the opposition. In one match against Essex, he deliberately {{allowed himself to be}} bowled first ball in protest against Australia's ruthless approach to batting; that day, his side set a world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket (721).|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Scully stumble on to a bizarre murder case where the main suspect {{is a man with}} an unusual obsession for The Brady Bunch. Despite their initial differences—both in investigative style <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> The Brady Bunch—the four of them soon learn that the man's telekinetic ability is the ultimate, undeniable proof of an X-File.|$|E
5|$|To avoid a narrator, {{the serial}} delegates the novel's first ironic {{sentence}} to Elizabeth {{in an early}} scene. The adaptation opens {{with a view of}} Darcy's and Bingley's horses as they race across a field toward the Netherfield estate, expressing vitality; Elizabeth watches them before breaking into a run. While the novel indicates Elizabeth's independence and energy in her three-mile trek to Netherfield, the adaptation of this scene also shows her rebelliousness <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> nature.|$|E

5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear that the author had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either a family member or courtier.|$|E

25|$|Martin Luther {{summarized}} the commandment against shedding innocent blood as {{grounded in the}} fear <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> God, and as having {{both positive and negative}} aspects: negative in that we must neither harm nor hurt our neighbor’s body; positive in that we must help our neighbor and care for him when he is ill.|$|E

25|$|While {{he was at}} Berkeley in 1925, his {{knowledge}} of physics <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> gadgets led him to develop a self-recording maze that gained him a publication—his first—with {{one of the best-known}} cognitive psychologists of his time, E.C Tolman. Both psychology and physics would remain of interest to him, and he often had to struggle with his loyalties to one or the other.|$|E
25|$|Although Dutch {{painting}} of the Golden Age {{is included in the}} general European period of Baroque painting, and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> splendour typical of much Baroque work, including that of neighbouring Flanders.

25|$|Williams {{expressed}} that {{his relationship with}} <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> off-broadway New York theatres, such as the National Black Theater in Harlem gave him the skill set needed for his portrayal of Omar; in particular using the Meisner technique to create Omar from the ground up, immersing himself by researching details of inner city Baltimore.

25|$|In {{the last}} entry {{of the journal}} from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write {{a new book about}} the worship of God. He soon began working on De cultu et amore Dei, or The Worship <b>and</b> <b>Love</b> <b>of</b> God. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it {{published}} in London in June 1745.|$|E
25|$|For example, Tsai Ming-liang's Vive L'Amour, {{which won}} the Golden Lion at the 1994 Venice Film Festival, portrays the isolation, despair, <b>and</b> <b>love</b> <b>of</b> young adults living in the upscale apartments of Taipei. Stan Lai's The Peach Blossom Land (1992) is a tragi-comedy {{involving}} two groups of actors rehearsing different plays on the same stage; the masterful juxtaposition {{and the depth of}} the play's political and psychological meanings helped it win recognition at festivals in Tokyo and Berlin.|$|E
