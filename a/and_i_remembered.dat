Rihanna told Rolling Stone about her interest in bondage and other sadomasochism activities, themes central to [...] "S": [...] "I like to take charge, but I love to be submissive... being submissive in the bedroom is really fun. You get to be a little lady, to have somebody be macho and in charge." ...|$|E

And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of the}} community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> the stranger, beggared and straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, and I realised that God Most High would ask me about all of them, and I (Umar) would testify about them, and I feared that I should find no excuse when I was with God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gehry, [...] "I was a {{truck driver}} in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried {{chemical}} engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I?

Now Gerald Whitfeld [...] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village {{to the scene of the}} mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I {{will never forget}} arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20minutes and then we went in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground...

[...] Monty said [...] "All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future." ...|$|E
