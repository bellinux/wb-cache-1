5|$|<b>A</b> <b>criticism</b> of New Age {{often made}} by leftists {{is that its}} focus on individualism {{deflects}} participants from engaging in socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age {{as a manifestation of}} consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, {{who argued that}} religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E

5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures delivered at Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{slated for}} a {{theatrical}} release in November 2007, its release date was postponed, and it received a wide theatrical release on May 30, 2008. It grossed $82.4 {{million at the}} box office worldwide. Although a box office hit, it received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising its atmosphere and tension, and others criticizing its script and characters. Contemporary film scholars have interpreted the film as <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of the perceived safety of pastoral life, as well as an exploration of stranger-on-stranger violence.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>criticism</b> of {{this method}} {{is that it can}} be {{statistically}} weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1844, Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, {{beginning}} a lifelong friendship. Engels showed Marx his recently published The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, convincing Marx that {{the working class}} would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history. Soon, Marx and Engels were collaborating on <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of the philosophical ideas of Marx's former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family. Although critical of Bauer, Marx was increasingly influenced by {{the ideas of the}} Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.|$|E

5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the internal aspects of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|However, Purcell's music (and with it The Fairy-Queen) was resuscitated by {{two related}} movements: a growing {{interest}} in Baroque music {{and the rise of}} the countertenor, led by pioneers such as Alfred Deller and Russell Oberlin. The former movement led to performances of long-neglected composers such as Purcell, John Dowland, John Blow and even George Frideric Handel, while the latter complemented it by providing a way of making such performances as authentic as possible as regards the original music and the composer's intentions (less true for Handel, where countertenors appear as castrati replacements). This has led to The Fairy-Queen's increased popularity, and numerous recordings have been made, often using period instruments. The format of the work presents problems to modern directors, who must decide whether or not to present Purcell's music as part of the original play, which uncut is rather lengthy. Savage calculated a length of four hours. The decision to curtail the play is usually taken together with the resolution to modernise to such an extent that the cohesion between music, text and action sketched above is entirely lost, <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> levelled at the English National Opera's 1995 production directed by David Pountney. The production was released on video the same year, and revived by the company in 2002. A bold approach was taken at the Brazilian Opera Company's 2000 staging by Luiz Päetow, with the libretto becoming unstuck in time.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} <b>a</b> <b>criticism</b> of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of {{intellectual}} ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not <b>a</b> <b>criticism,</b> because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not <b>a</b> <b>criticism,</b> because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, and she thinks that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E
