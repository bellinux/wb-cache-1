You weren't as surrounded by your peers <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else</b> your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio...

McCartney remembered asking Evans [...] "again and again" [...] to write down McCartney's newly found cannabis-influenced thoughts about life by repeating [...] "Get [...] it down, Mal, get it down!" [...] Evans was as affected by the drug <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else,</b> so took {{a very long time}} to find a pencil and a piece of paper. The next morning Evans gave the sheet of paper to McCartney, which read that McCartney had dictated: [...] "There are seven levels!" [...] (of life, as he later explained). The Beatles attended [...] "The Night of 100 Stars" [...] at the London Palladium on 23 July 1964, and during the show Evans constantly supplied them with whisky and Coca-Cola, which he delivered to them balanced on a wooden oar he had found backstage.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There {{was a good deal}} of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know {{what will happen to the}} material he put together, and is as much in the dark <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

He also ignores that Villings could not be part of Tuvalu because the islands of this archipelago are atolls. They are flat, barely above sea level, with no hills or cliffs, unlike Villings.

2500|$|While {{taking a}} {{traditional}} position on human sexuality, maintaining the Church's moral opposition to homosexual acts, John PaulII asserted {{that people with}} homosexual inclinations possess the same inherent dignity and rights <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> In his book Memory and Identity {{he referred to the}} [...] "strong pressures" [...] by the European Parliament to recognise homosexual unions as an alternative type of family, with the right to adopt children. In the book, as quoted by Reuters, he wrote: [...] "It is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, more subtle and hidden, perhaps, intent upon exploiting human rights themselves against man and against the family." [...] A 1997 study determined that 3% of the pope's statements were about the issue of sexual morality.|$|E

The soil was in his pores. Unlike most American Communists, who managed to pass from [...] one big city to another without seeing anything in the intervening spaces, Ware was absorbed in the land and its problems.

2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else.</b> It's hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step {{and he was going to}} take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at me like he did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E

50|$|Chydenius was outspoken about {{universal}} {{rights and}} the abolition of privilege.

He promoted democracy and defended the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of trade and industry, and the workers rights. He called for an oversight of the way the state funds were spent.

50|$|This film is more sober in its description.

5000|$|The character's name {{first came}} to Child in a {{supermarket}} when an old lady, noting the span of Child's arms, asked for his help in reaching out to a can of pears. On seeing this, Child's wife commented that if his writing career did not work out he could [...] "always get {{a job as a}} reacher in a supermarket". Reacher's ex-military background was a specific and tactical choice on his behalf. Child has explained, [...] "I thought that I would do a book that's not the same <b>as</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>else's.</b> <b>Everybody</b> <b>else</b> had their guy working: a private guy in Boston or a police lieutenant in L.A., or wherever. I thought, 'Well, he won't be working, and he won't live anywhere, and let's just take it from there.'" [...] Child also felt that this origin would lend itself to the character's personality and nomadic lifestyle: [...] "This idea of the rootless alienation has got to come from somewhere, and I noticed that the most alienated people are always ex-military, because it’s like going from one solar system to the other, it’s so different. So that was an easy choice: Make him ex-military. Then make him ex-military police because, broadly speaking, these would be crime novels, and he had to have some investigative experience, and he had to understand procedures and forensics and so on. So that part was all set in stone".|$|R
