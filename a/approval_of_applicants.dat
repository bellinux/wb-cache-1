40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to compare the scoring models of banking and non-banking {{institutions}} when using specific outcomes of the request for a loan of CZK 100 000,- of several natural persons with varying credibility (the credibility of credit). The theoretical part {{is divided into two}} chapters, the first deals with the explanation of basic terms (credit, the applicant, bank and non-bank institutions, credit scoring, rating, review on the software used and legislation in the CR). The second chapter is devoted to describe the process of credit scoring, scoring models and a scoring function. The practical part is dedicated to the comparison of two methods for <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> for the loan at the non-bank and bank institutions.

40|$|The Agreement is {{to provide}} {{students}} in good standing enrolled in a graduate degree or diploma program at a CAGS (Canadian Association for Graduate Studies) member university the opportunity to avail themselves of courses offered at another member institution (host) for transfer credit to the program at their institution (home). The definition of 'home" is the institution in which the student applicant is enrolled {{and is expected to}} provide the graduate degree or diploma. The'host ' is defined as the institution at which course credits can be obtained that can be counted toward a degree or diploma at the home institution. <b>Approval</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applicants</b> The intent of this Agreement is that such an arrangement would prove to be to the mutual advantage of the host and home institutions. Whereas there may be imbalances apparent within specific programs in the short term, whether an institution serves as either home or host, at an institutional level a balanced reciprocity should, at least in principle, occur in the long run. Students applying {{to take advantage of this}} Agreement would not be required to go through the normal application process associated with being accepted as a transfer student. The only documentation required to process such cases would be the single page request form. ln other words, a student in good standing at any member institution would not require any additional documentation other than the completed application to access transfer credit courses at any member host institution...|$|E

50|$|Section 1323 {{requires}} the HHS Secretary {{to conduct a}} criminal and financial background check of providers and suppliers seeking to participate in Medicare.

If the Secretary finds that these affiliations pose an undue risk to Medicare or Medicaid, then approval can be denied or safety mechanisms can be established. Knowingly making false statements to the Secretary will result in exclusion from the Medicare program and a fine.

50|$|In Scottish Catholic schools, {{employment}} of non-Catholics can be restricted by the Church; often, {{one of the}} requirements for Catholic applicants is to possess a certificate that has been signed by their parish priest, although each diocese has its own variation on the method <b>of</b> <b>approval.</b> Non-Catholic <b>applicants</b> {{are not required to}} provide any religious documentation. Certain positions, such as headteachers, deputy heads, religious education teachers and guidance teachers are required to be Roman Catholic. Scottish faith schools have the practice of school-wide daily assembly/worship; some Catholic schools even have their own prayer. Whilst maintaining a strong Catholic ethos, Scottish Catholic schools have long welcomed pupils from other faith backgrounds, though they tend to give precedence to non-Catholics who come from religious families and a large number of Muslims also go to Catholic schools.|$|R

[...] Like in the Soviet Union, attempting to leave without permissions to a non-Eastern Bloc state was punishable as treason, with Albania and Romania invoking the death penalty for such offenses. [...] Even after families applied to leave to join refugees fleeing during the confusion of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Czechoslovakian authorities informed them [...] "it is contrary to the State's interest to allow Czechoslovak citizens long-term private sojourns abroad, and that includes emigration.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{recruitment}} behaviour of firms at the extensive margin; we empirically explore the relationship between employer search strategies and the number <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> by means <b>of</b> (reduced form) two-equations simultaneous models. The empirical analysis is carried out on a rich micro data set on Dutch employer recruitment behaviour. Our empirical analysis reveals that the economic conditions prevailing on the labour market influence employer search activity at the extensive margin. In particular, we see that in tight (slack) labour markets characterised by excess demand (supply) of labour, the flow <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> is smaller (larger). Employers react to the shortage (excess) <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> by using more (less) often advertisements.

Methodology: A descriptive study based on the records <b>of</b> <b>applicants</b> for dentistry programs in universities using the PSU test for their admissions from 2012 to 2014.

40|$|Interviewers' {{questioning}} {{behavior and}} predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings varies considerably in unstructured interviews. A model hypothesizing {{a relationship between}} these variables is tested in this study. The model proposes {{that the relationship between}} interviewer questioning behavior and evaluation validity is mediated by the diagnosticity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information that is collected during the interview. The process and content of three interviewers' questioning of 149 candidates for an entry-level correctional officer position was examined. Although the complete information gathering model was not supported, a robust relationship between questioning behavior and information diagnosticity emerged. Furthermore, the validity <b>of</b> individual interviewers' <b>applicant</b> evaluations varied considerably. These results reinforce the existence of differences in interviewers' questioning behavior and differences in the quality <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> information they gather. Because differences in questioning behavior correspond to differences in the predictive validity <b>of</b> <b>applicant</b> ratings, both these variables should be monitored at the individual interviewer level...|$|R
