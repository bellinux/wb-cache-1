5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women was no reason for the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often <b>atavistic</b> images.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} section of The Origin of Birds, Heilmann {{examines}} the Tetrapteryx hypothesis proposed by William Beebe in 1915. This hypothesis {{was based on}} observations of bird embryos and hatchlings, which Beebe found to possess a presumably <b>atavistic</b> fringe of flight feathers on their hindlimbs. His main evidence came from examination of incipient quill feathers on the thigh of a four-day-old white-winged dove.

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and <b>atavistic</b> national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} {{review of a}} festschrift in honour of Rabbi Elmer Berger Anti-Zionism: Analytical Reflections (1988), Sheldon Richman {{characterized}} Shahak's interpretation of Zionism as an <b>atavistic</b> reaction against the European Enlightenment's individualism that strove to revive the suffocating world of the ghetto. The founders of the movement did not believe Jews could lead a normal existence in democratic societies. In this sense, for Shahak, Zionism {{can be thought of}} as [...] "a mirror image of anti-Semitism," [...] in that, in common with anti-Semites, Zionists considered Jews to be aliens who must be quarantined from the rest of the world, a viewpoint Shahak read as capitulating to European anti-Semitism.

2500|$|His {{interest}} in portraiture led Degas to study carefully {{the ways in}} which a person's social stature or form of employment may be revealed by their physiognomy, posture, dress, and other attributes.

In 1881 he exhibited two pastels, Criminal Physiognomies, that depicted juvenile gang members recently convicted of murder in the [...] "Abadie Affair".

2500|$|Tagore's poetic style, which {{proceeds}} from a lineage established by 15th- and 16th-century Vaishnava poets, ranges from classical formalism to the comic, visionary, and ecstatic. He {{was influenced by}} the <b>atavistic</b> mysticism of Vyasa and other rishi-authors of the Upanishads, the Bhakti-Sufi mystic Kabir, and Ramprasad Sen. Tagore's most innovative and mature poetry embodies his exposure to Bengali rural folk music, which included mystic Baul ballads such as those of the bard Lalon. These, rediscovered and repopularised by Tagore, resemble 19th-century Kartābhajā hymns that emphasise inward divinity and rebellion against bourgeois bhadralok religious and social orthodoxy. During his Shelaidaha years, his poems took on a lyrical voice of the moner manush, the Bāuls' [...] "man within the heart" [...] and Tagore's [...] "life force of his deep recesses", or meditating upon the jeevan devata—the demiurge or the [...] "living God within". This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama. Such tools saw use in his Bhānusiṃha poems chronicling the Radha-Krishna romance, which were repeatedly revised over the course of seventy years.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, the {{character}} of the Gothic pervades even those aspects of the novel that at first glance seem to be far away from the Gothic genre. The buried treasure, for instance, could point to classification of The Mystery of the Sea as an adventure story, but this treasure has come down through the centuries as a hereditary trust, protected most recently by Don Bernardino, a clear [...] "representative of the past" [...] and an [...] "evolutionary throwback", evoking the mysterious past and <b>atavistic</b> qualities that are characteristic of Gothic fiction. Scholars such as Lisa Hopkins have also noticed direct connections between the cave where the treasure is hidden and a similar treasure cave in Ann Radcliffe's The Sicilian Romance. Politics, too, are underscored by the Gothic. Marjory's kidnapping is provoked by political motives, but this line of the story echoes the Gothic plotline of an innocent, imprisoned young woman whose lover must come and rescue her from wicked (often foreign) men. The Mystery of the Sea, although difficult to classify, is a thriller in any context, and one that, as outlined above, displays tendencies of long-standing genres as well as those that were newly emerging in Stoker's time.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} stop the turmoil that worsened in the country every time a {{naturalized}} died, the Residence demanded a fatwa, in April, from the Sharaa Court of Tunis, the highest religious body of the protectorate. The Maliki and Hanafi sheikhs {{in charge of the}} case issued a sentence that solves nothing: They maintained the apostate status of a naturalized but said that if he repented, even verbally, before his death, burial in Muslim lands will be granted. This decision angered the nationalists while riots started in Kairouan and Tunis. Bourguiba denounced the duplicity of religious authorities, the provocations of the government, cast aspersions on naturalized and criticized the Destourian press whose [...] "caution considered as the ultimate strategy seems overwhelmed". He invited the French people and Ahmad II Bey to intervene. Meanwhile, the Residence took a two-phased decision: Firstly, it yielded deciding that naturalized will be buried in special burial place, which appeared to be ghettos excluding them from the community. And secondly, François Manceron, resident-general at the time, enacted decrees judged [...] "super-scoundrel" [...] by Joachim Durel, granting him authority to imprison and arrest, at his will, any nationalist, also giving him the authority to suspend any newspaper or association [...] "hostile to the Protectorate". Bourguiba commented this decision writing: [...] "Repression comes too late. The <b>atavistic</b> fatalism of an oppressed people was shaken".|$|E
2500|$|British {{colonial and}} Imperial actions in Africa {{could also be}} seen as {{contributing}} to this negative portrayal of African heritage; indeed, the passages describing the [...] "negro" [...] bear some similarities to the heavily racist language in famous works associated with imperialism, such as Conrad's Heart of Darkness (which predates The Mystery of the Sea by only three years). In both novels, the black characters are portrayed as <b>atavistic</b> and savage, but Stoker's portrayal is much more simplistic, pinning the origin of evil directly on the [...] "negro". Regardless of how the reader reacts to Conrad's and Stoker's respective descriptions of dark-skinned people, {{it is important to recognize}} that The Mystery of the Sea is part of a larger discourse on race that was influenced by the vitality of the British Empire. Indeed, racism has been characterized by some as [...] "colonialism brought home", which fits in with Archibald's thoughts on the one black character in the novel as well as the larger political and imperialist themes of the work. Archibald is not directly involved with the conflict in Cuba, nor is he involved with colonization (although colonial implications could possibly be drawn from the fact that he is an Englishman living in Scotland). However, despite Archibald's lack of immediate involvement in British Imperial schemes, he is an embodiment of popular perceptions of race and [...] "civilization" [...] as the British knew it. He feels no qualms about killing the black man, recognizes an active evil in this racial [...] "other", and triumphs in rescuing the purity of his white beloved from the threat of her dark-skinned attacker.|$|E
2500|$|Robert C. Bolles (1970), a {{researcher}} at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools {{that were used to}} measure this tendency were {{out of touch with the}} natural world. He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR). There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to <b>atavistic</b> standards and become [...] "wild" [...] again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, is seen to be more important in SSRDs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened, the wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered a species-specific defense reaction or behavior. Bolles believed that SSDR are conditioned through pavlovian conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDR arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events. Michael S. Fanselow conducted an experiment, to test some specific defense reactions, he observed that rats in two different shock situations responded differently, based on instinct or defensive topography, rather than contextual information.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what to make}} of these apomorphies {{supposedly}} uniting Anseriformes and bony-toothed birds, for on the other hand, the sternum, distal humerus, leg and foot bones of pelagornithids seem to show apomorphies typical of [...] "higher waterbirds". While details of the braincase bones are held to be very informative phylogenetically, the skull features in which the two groups are similar are generally related {{to the point where the}} bill attaches to the skull, and thus might have been subject to the selective forces brought about by skimming food from the upper water layer. The apparent non-neoavian traits distinguishing pelagornithids could just as well be retained or <b>atavistic</b> plesiomorphies; as the [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] are very ancient Neoaves and none of the suspected basal members of their radiation (see also [...] "Graculavidae") were included in the analysis, it is not known for sure when the derived conditions typical of modern Neoaves were acquired. Footbone traits are notoriously prone to selection forces in birds, with convergent evolution known to inhibit or even invalidate cladistic analyses; however, the apparent autapomorphies of the lower arm and hand bones are hard to explain by anything else than an actual relationship. The location of the salt glands inside the eye sockets of Osteodontornis, Pelagornis (and probably others) shows that whatever their relationships were, the pelagornithids adapted to an oceanic habitat independently from penguins and tubenoses, which instead have supraorbital salt glands. Their missing or vestigial hallux – like in ducks but unlike in pelicans which have all four toes fully developed and webbed – was held against a close relationship with pelicans. But as is known today, pelicans are closer to storks (which have a hallux but no webbing) than to pseudotooth birds and evolved their fully webbed toes independently. With both a webbed and a hypotrophied hallux being apomorphic and paraphyletic, its absence in pseudotooth birds does not provide much information on their relationship.|$|E

Why do you, Mr. Calvin, work all your nights and days to organize the farmers, {{along with the rest}} of the middle class, into a new political party? Because the politicians of the old parties will have nothing to do with your <b>atavistic</b> ideas; and with your <b>atavistic</b> ideas, they will have nothing to do because they are what I said they are, henchmen, retainers of the Plutocracy.|$|E

6000|$|Follow my reasoning. An {{instinct}} is a racial memory. Very good. Then you and I {{and all of}} us receive these memories from our fathers and mothers, as they received them from their fathers and mothers. Therefore there must be a medium whereby these memories are transmitted from generation to generation. This medium is what Weismann terms the [...] "germplasm." [...] It carries the memories of the whole evolution of the race. These memories are dim and confused, {{and many of them are}} lost. But some strains of germplasm carry an excessive freightage of memories--are, to be scientific, more <b>atavistic</b> than other strains; and such a strain is mine. I am a freak of heredity, an <b>atavistic</b> nightmare--call me what you will; but here I am, real and alive, eating three hearty meals a day, and what are you going to do about it? ...|$|E
