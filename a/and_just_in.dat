25|$|A drop in Jeep sales {{caused by}} the declining economy and soaring energy prices began to constrict AMC's cash flow. At the same time, {{pressure}} increased on the company's non-Jeep product lines. The face-lifts and rebranding of AMC's once-innovative and successful cars were not enough in a competitive landscape that had changed dramatically. No longer was the threat limited to the Big Three automakers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). The Japanese manufacturers (Honda, Toyota, Nissan) used streamlined production methods such as outsourcing <b>and</b> <b>Just</b> <b>In</b> Time (JIT) supply-chain management. They had new, highly efficient assembly plants in the United States. And now they targeted the heart of AMC's passenger product line: small cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, as World War II {{started to}} have an effect on American life, many schools began {{dropping}} less popular sports as transportation and hiring qualified coaches became a serious issue. The association polled its membership to investigate the possibility of ending the spring sports season. The poll supported keeping the season. All over the country, as gas rationing threatened to prevent teams and officials from traveling, IHSA Secretary Al Willis was able to get special exemptions for Illinois teams and officials; a precedent that spread to other states, very likely saving high school competitions during the war. By 1943, the IHSA had to look at making changes to its rules regarding eligible coaches, and the prospect of military veterans returning to high school. Ironically, the federal government eventually did put a limit to post season travel for high schools in May, 1945; too late to stop Illinois' spring tournaments, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time to herald the end of the war. In the end, the IHSA did not curtail its sports tournaments throughout the war.|$|E

Higginbotham would later describe his judicial philosophy on the appellate bench as being in line with Justice Cardozo, rejecting the strict constructionist concept, in favor of [...] "an evolutionary concept in terms of what is fair <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> a society."

2500|$|Because {{they arrived}} first {{and had a}} strong sense of {{community}} and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.

[...] Upon seeing the British troops come into sight the men of the 14th realised that they were about to be disarmed and began loading their weapons and making ready for a fight.

2500|$|The {{storm of}} {{controversy}} {{that was created}} by Velikovsky's works, especially Worlds in Collision, may have helped revive the Catastrophist movements {{in the last half}} of the 20th century; it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the negative aspects of the so-called Velikovsky Affair. The assessment of Velikovsky's work by tree-ring expert Mike Baillie is instructive: [...] "But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets … As if to comfort his readers, at one point he says that no planet at present has a course which poses a danger to this planet: '…only a few asteroids—mere rocks, a few kilometres in diameter—have orbits which cross the path of the earth.' … He did not know about the hazard posed by relatively small objects, <b>and,</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> case there is any doubt about his mistake, he repeats the notion by noting that a possibility exists of some future collision between planets, 'not a mere encounter between a planet and an asteroid'. This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth." ...|$|E
