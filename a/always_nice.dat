500|$|The episode's antagonist, Klineman Halpen, {{is portrayed}} by Tim McInnerny. Davies {{considered}} his character—"a middle manager who's {{out of his}} depth"—a perfect villain. Temple described him as [...] "narcissistic", [...] "preening" [...] and [...] "ruthless ... without sentiment". McInnerny said [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to play a bastard... I'm glad Halpen's a three-dimensional bastard! That makes him interesting!". Temple epitomised Halpen in a scene where he kills an operative for the activist group [...] "Friends of the Ood"; Davies and Tennant felt that his [...] "disgusting" [...] and [...] "gothic ... Edgar Allan Poe" [...] fate would be undeserved otherwise.|$|E
500|$|After the WaveAid concert, {{from early}} 2005, Powderfinger had {{a period of}} hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the {{personal}} front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife. Middleton's side project, Drag, had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging, in 2002. Zombos Reviews found the EP was [...] "full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads". Their debut album, The Way Out, recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was [...] "a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> melodies and harmonies". Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace, in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the race}} was mainly negative. Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere dello Sport – Stadio called it [...] "boring", while fellow Italian paper Corriere della Sera wrote of [...] "Formula One like a sleeping pill". Sky Sports described the race as [...] "mundane" [...] and [...] "soporific". Spanish newspaper Sport highlighted Max Verstappen's [...] "spectacular" [...] overtaking as bringing [...] "the only colour" [...] into the race. The Independent wrote, referring to Hamilton's desperate attempts to pass Rosberg: [...] "If {{there was ever a}} race which confirmed that Formula One should be looking at ways to facilitate overtaking, this was it." [...] In the wake of his experience, Hamilton called for Formula One to adjust rules to enhance overtaking, saying: [...] "I guess for fans it's probably not too exciting to watch. Of course, it's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> when you're at the front, as we have been for some time now - but still, being able to race is what... and also down the back, {{the rest of the field}} is probably what fans want to see. That's probably a change that would be looked positively on." [...] Sebastian Vettel agreed, calling for more grip created by the tyres to make it easier to follow a car closely.|$|E

500|$|Churchill's final {{departure}} from political office came some sixteen months later when, on 5 April 1955, he chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty {{years since he}} had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be Prime Minister, Churchill replied, [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to be home". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting [...] "by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, [...] "in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating {{the view of the}} valley he had loved for so long". On 13 October 1964, Churchill's last dinner guests at Chartwell were his former principal private secretary Sir Leslie Rowan and his wife. Lady Rowan later recalled, [...] "It was sad to see such a great man become so frail". The following week, increasingly incapacitated, Churchill left the house for the last time. His official biographer Martin Gilbert records Churchill was, [...] "never to see his beloved Chartwell again". After his death in January 1965, Lady Churchill immediately relinquished her lease and presented Chartwell to the National Trust. It was opened to the public in 1966, one year after Churchill's death.|$|E
500|$|If the {{candidate}} was manic, {{he was also}} dedicated and filled with good humor, {{and he had a}} particular genius for getting media attention. He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to the Peoples Temple. If they ask you to do something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it." ...|$|E

He eventually worked his way back into the side and had a strong season, highlights including 10-76 against Tasmania. His excellent bowling in the Sheffield Shield final against Queensland helped New South Wales to victory. [...] "It's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to take wickets, the ...|$|E

[...] Grace commented that [...] "I do not feel that our show is to blame for what happened to Melinda Duckett. The truth is not <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> or polite or easy to go down. Sometimes it's harsh, and it hurts." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994 the Ku Klux Klan {{applied to}} sponsor {{a portion of}} United States Interstate 55 in St. Louis County and Jefferson County, Missouri, near St. Louis, for cleanup (which allowed them to have signs stating that this section of highway was {{maintained}} by the organization). Since the state could not refuse the KKK's sponsorship, the Missouri legislature voted to name the highway section the [...] "Rosa Parks Highway". When asked how she felt about this honor, she {{is reported to have}} commented, [...] "It is <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to be thought of." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Hecht {{published}} his autobiography, A Child of the Century, which, according to literary critic Robert Schmuhl, [...] "received such extensive critical acclaim that his literary reputation improved markedly {{during the last}} decade of his life... Hecht's vibrant and candid memoir of more than six hundred pages restored him to the stature of a serious and significant American writer." [...] Novelist Saul Bellow commented about the book for the New York Times: [...] "His manners are not <b>always</b> <b>nice,</b> but then nice manners do not always make interesting autobiographies, and this autobiography has the merit of being intensely interesting... If he is occasionally slick, he is also independent, forthright, and original. Among the pussycats who write of social issues today, he roars like an old-fashioned lion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lancashire batted on {{for another}} 49 overs, scoring 195 for 6 declared, and setting Somerset a target of 247 runs in 31 overs. Paul Horton and Loye put on 94 for the first wicket. But all in all, taking 61 overs to score 195 was hardly {{declaration}} batting. Somerset did not go for the win (which would have meant scoring at well over 7 an over), and made 69 for 3 off 22.3 overs before play ended because of bad light. Lancashire's Mal Loye, who fell just short of his century on 92 in the second innings to go with his 53 in the first said, [...] "To {{get a couple of}} fifties against a pretty good attack is a good start. It was a pretty difficult pitch to bat on during the first day but it got easier as the match wore on and I was disappointed to miss out. Getting a century is a psychological thing for a batsman. I don't set myself goals or anything like that, but it's <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to get a hundred." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon Viklund {{returns as}} the game's {{composer}} for the sequel. [...] The arrangements {{were created in}} Buzz, a freeware virtual studio program. Viklund cited games on the Nintendo Entertainment System as influences for Rearmed 2s music, including the Mega Man series, DuckTales, and Gun.Smoke. [...] When asked {{about the possibility of}} a commercial release to the game's soundtrack, Viklund states [...] "I do encourage those who ask me if there will be a BCR2 soundtrack to contact Capcom. Really, it's up to them." [...] A contest was held from July 16, 2010 to August 11, 2010 allowing fans to remix an 8-bit Bionic Commando track for inclusion in the game. [...] On September 14, 2010 two winners were chosen. [...] Their remixes were included in the music for Bionic Commando Rearmed 2. [...] Regarding the winners' arrangements, Viklund stated [...] "What I had to say about the winning submissions was that I think it's a cliché at this point to bring in the electric guitars on interpretations of old NES songs, and yet it’s <b>always</b> <b>nice</b> to hear that (or any) cliché actually done well. Those two guys both did it really well." ...|$|E
