5|$|Chloe Frazer is Nathan Drake's other love interest. She {{appears in}} the second video game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, where Claudia Black voiced the character. Black's {{interactions}} with Drake's voice actor Nolan North played {{a large role in}} developing the character. In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Frazer begins as a business associate of Drake and Harry Flynn when a benefactor hires the group to steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum. She and Drake had a romantic relationship sometime before the events of the game, which they covertly resume until Flynn betrays Drake and he ends up in a Turkish jail. Frazer bails him out and joins forces with Drake and Sullivan. She then begins traveling with Flynn and Lazarevic, acting as a double agent, and discovers that they <b>are</b> <b>after</b> the fabled city of Shambhala and the Cintamani stone, seeking immortality. Although her loyalties are called into question multiple times {{over the course of the}} game, she chooses to help Drake defeat Lazaravic in Shambhala. Her feelings for Drake are complicated, and she ends up voluntarily ending the relationship once she sees he is in love with Elena Fisher.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they <b>are.</b> <b>After</b> hearing this, Mulder believes his mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people <b>are</b> <b>after</b> him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.|$|E

Less technically skilled interviewees coped with these challenges by collaborating with other people, but they were less positive about their respective site’s success compared to interviewees whose skills enabled them to work alone. We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R

5|$|The {{boxes are}} found to have been bought with bogus names and cash 23 years ago. Raul's amputated forearm is {{examined}} and discovered to be radioactive, leading Walter to conclude these <b>are</b> <b>after</b> effects of using the technology to pass through walls. Olivia and Peter go to a bar to find out information about Raul {{from one of his}} old friends, who says Raul has spent much of his time at the VA. While there, Peter realizes the numbers of the stolen safe deposit boxes match numbers Walter continually spouts off at night. When they confront him, Walter says it is the Fibonacci sequence, and he then realizes that the safe deposit boxes are his. Walter tries to remember what he put in the boxes and where the next two are. Meanwhile, Broyles discovers the VA that Raul went to was in Washington, D.C., leading Olivia to find out Raul and three other patients were in a chess club together. The FBI discovers these men bought a plane ticket to Providence, and Walter remembers which bank he would've used to store something. But when Olivia and Charlie arrive at the bank, the safe deposit box has already been stolen. When they are fleeing, Olivia is able to wound and capture one of the men.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{supporting}} characters that consistently appear throughout the episodes. Bosco is {{the proprietor of}} the nearby convenience store and supplies the Freelance Police {{with a number of}} items across the game. Driven paranoid by repeated shoplifting, Bosco is obsessed with conspiracies, believing that nearly every US government agency, as well as many criminal outfits, <b>are</b> <b>after</b> him. As such, his store is overwhelmed with security devices and contraptions created by Bosco himself. He regularly attempts to disguise himself as a variety of foreign nationals, but to little effect. Further down the neighborhood is Sybil Pandemik, who owns a small office across from Sam and Max. Sybil is unable to keep a consistent job and regularly changes her career choices. Introduced as a psychotherapist, she is noted to have worked as a tattoo artist, software tester, tabloid journalist and professional witness. In a hole in Sam and Max's own office resides Jimmy Two-Teeth, a rat who works as a petty criminal, confidence trickster and fence. He profusely dislikes Sam and Max, who he sees as always interfering with his work.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first game, Max has been {{reinstated}} as a detective in the NYPD. Max is called on to investigate a gunfight at a warehouse owned by Max's old associate Vladimir Lem and discovers the place has been attacked by a group of hitmen called the Cleaners. He encounters Mona Sax, who was presumed dead {{at the end of the}} previous game. Max heads to a restaurant owned by Lem and rescues him from his old foe Vinnie Gognitti; Lem claims that Gognitti is trying to monopolize the black market gun trade and sees Lem as a threat. After evading an attack by the Cleaners in his Apartment, Max tracks Mona to an abandoned funhouse and learns that the Cleaners <b>are</b> <b>after</b> anyone who knows about the secretive Inner Circle. While attempting to track down a contact, Mona is arrested because of her crimes and is taken in to the police station, despite Max's protests.|$|E

25|$|The adult spiders are photophobic {{and live}} in places free from light, {{frequently}} in caves and tunnels, though they can sometimes be seen outside of caves and mines as they will emerge around dusk to hunt, often using a single silk lasso line and swinging down upon their prey. They are often found {{in areas that are}} frequented by bats. The spiders are most often observed in railway tunnels and mines since these {{are more likely to be}} visited by humans. The young spiders <b>are,</b> <b>after</b> several instars, (and in contrast to the adults) strongly attracted to light—probably an evolutionary adaptation which ensures the spread of the species to new areas (see Life cycle for further details).|$|E
25|$|Boyer moves {{outside the}} leading {{currents}} in mainstream cognitive psychology {{and suggests that}} we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains <b>are,</b> <b>after</b> all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's theory of evolution. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those reproductive ends.|$|E

Ciprigna is unaware of the purpose of his visit and smitten by the {{handsome}} young man, begins to flirt with him. Fiuta advises Lelio to play along with the flirtation in order to trap her. Bonario rehearses a new speech to his wife in front of an empty chair. Fiuta provides his master with pistols which he can use to intimidate Ciprigna when he makes his speech. However, she grabs the pistols, turns them on Bonario, and further terrifies him. Meanwhile, Valerio, Cilia and Fiuta trick Giglio into believing that assassins <b>are</b> <b>after</b> him. He hides in a closet from which he observes Lelio and Ciprigna's flirtation and her attempts to seduce him. When Giglio's hiding place is exposed, the act ends in uproar and confusion.|$|E
25|$|Hitchcock's films {{sometimes}} feature characters {{struggling in}} their relationships with their mothers. In North by Northwest (1959), Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an innocent man ridiculed by his mother for insisting that shadowy, murderous men <b>are</b> <b>after</b> him. In The Birds (1963), the Rod Taylor character, an innocent man, finds his world under attack by vicious birds, and struggles to free himself from a clinging mother (Jessica Tandy). The killer in Frenzy (1972) has a loathing of women but idolises his mother. The villain Bruno in Strangers on a Train hates his father, but has an incredibly close relationship with his mother (played by Marion Lorne). Sebastian (Claude Rains) in Notorious has a clearly conflictual relationship with his mother, who is (correctly) suspicious of his new bride Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman). Norman Bates has troubles with his mother in Psycho.|$|E
25|$|In November {{pictures}} and a story cover the tents of activities set up around a chiropractor's house Bahá'ís {{from across the}} nation are visible in a local newspaper and programs describing {{the teachings of the}} religion are more visible in February 1972 scattered across the State. Rumors of the intensity of the wave of conversions echo in Lumberton, North Carolina even in 1975 - meanwhile a statewide conference in South Carolina was held February 1973 and a public presentation of the Bahá'í New year, (Bahá'í Naw-Rúz) was set in nearby Florence. The Bahá'í Faith at the University of South Carolina at Columbia was covered in the student newspaper The Gamecock. Digitization has been run from 1908 to 1988. There are about 45 pages that mention the religion (not including trivial repeats.) All but one <b>are</b> <b>after</b> 1967 but none of the articles mention the spread of the religion in South Carolina - there are a few larger profiles of the religion.|$|E
