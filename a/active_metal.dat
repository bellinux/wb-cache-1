5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and with water potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium with water is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{oxidation}} {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Lithium-ion battery technology for Electric Vehicle/Hybrid electric vehicle has received attention worldwide recently. The price of cobalt (Co) and lithium (Li) has increased due to the production of EV/HEV.   The used lithium battery is the valuable source of <b>active</b> <b>metals</b> (Co, Li, and Al) and the optimal way of extract these metals from this waste is still studied. The {{focus of this}} paper is to recovering <b>active</b> <b>metals</b> by using a hydro-metallurgical method in laboratory scale with 48. 8 Wh battery to reveal the economic and environment benefits. Calcination on extracted <b>active</b> <b>metals</b> as pre-thermal treatment has been conducted at 700 °C to remove the organic compounds from the surface of <b>active</b> <b>metals.</b> The experiment has been conducted and the result shows that the recovery of <b>active</b> <b>metals</b> (cathode) is 41 % of cell cathode and an anode is 8. 5 % of the cell anode materials, which are 48. 8 % and 23. 4 % of the cathode and anode cell material price, respectively. By recycling the battery <b>active</b> <b>metals</b> about 47. 34 %, the emission can be reduced by 47. 61 % for battery metal production and 60. 7 % for transportation of used battery disposal.

A variety of linking groups such as pyridine, phosphonic acid, and carboxylic acid can be selectively introduced to the 3,3′, 4,4′, and the 6,6′ positions of the 1,1'-binaphthyl moiety. Moreover, by changing the length of the linker ligands the porosity and framework structure of the MOF can be selectivily tuned.|$|E

25|$|Plating, painting, and the {{application}} of enamel are the most common anti-corrosion treatments. They work by providing a barrier of corrosion-resistant material between the damaging environment and the structural material. Aside from cosmetic and manufacturing issues, there may be tradeoffs in mechanical flexibility versus resistance to abrasion and high temperature. Platings usually fail only in small sections, but if the plating is more noble than the substrate (for example, chromium on steel), a galvanic couple will cause any exposed area to corrode much more rapidly than an unplated surface would. For this reason, it is often wise to plate with <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> such as zinc or cadmium.|$|E
25|$|Galvanic {{corrosion}} {{occurs when}} two different metals have physical or electrical contact {{with each other}} and are immersed in a common electrolyte, or when the same metal is exposed to electrolyte with different concentrations. In a galvanic couple, the more <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> (the anode) corrodes at an accelerated rate and the more noble metal (the cathode) corrodes at a slower rate. When immersed separately, each metal corrodes at its own rate. What type of metal(s) to use is readily determined by following the galvanic series. For example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial anode for steel structures. Galvanic corrosion is of major interest to the marine industry and also anywhere water (containing salts) contacts pipes or metal structures.|$|E
25|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a polymer to degradation {{depends on}} its structure. Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis, while polymers containing an unsaturated backbone are especially susceptible to ozone cracking. Carbon based polymers {{are more susceptible to}} thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications. High-temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of galvanic corrosion when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> such as aluminium in salt water environments.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> the catalysts typically contain a number of [...] "promoters," [...] including potassium and copper. Group 1 alkali metals, including potassium, are a poison for cobalt catalysts but are promoters for iron catalysts. Catalysts are supported on high-surface-area binders/supports such as silica, alumina, or zeolites. Promotors also have an important influence on activity. Alkali metal oxides and copper are common promotors, but the formulation depends on the primary metal, iron vs cobalt. Alkali oxides on cobalt catalysts generally cause activity to drop severely even with very low alkali loadings. C≥5 and CO2 selectivity increase while methane and C2–C4 selectivity decrease. In addition, the alkene to alkane ratio increases.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{approach}} involves {{the construction of}} MOFs that incorporate chiral reaction sites {{from a number of}} different components, potentially including chiral and achiral organic ligands, structural metal ions, catalytically <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> ions, and/or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores. [...] This field is relatively new, and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks. [...] One of these was reported in 2003, when a heterogeneous catalyst was reported that included structural zirconium, catalytically active ruthenium, and a BINAP-derived phosphonate as both chiral ligand and structural linker. [...] As little as 0.005mol% of this catalyst proved sufficient to achieve the asymmetric hydrogenation of aryl ketones, though the usual conditions featured 0.1mol % of catalyst and resulted in an enantiomeric excess of 90.6–99.2%.|$|E
6000|$|... 923. From this {{it seems}} {{apparent}} that the peculiar character and condition of an electrolyte is essential {{in one part of}} the voltaic circuit; and its nature being considered, good reasons appear why it and it alone should be effectual. An electrolyte is always a compound body: it can conduct, but only whilst decomposing. Its conduction depends upon its decomposition and the transmission of its particles in directions parallel to the current; and so intimate is this connexion, that if their transition be stopped, the current is stopped also; if their course be changed, its course and direction change with them; if they proceed in one direction, it has no power to proceed in any other than a direction invariably dependent on them. The particles of an electrolytic body are all so mutually connected, are in such relation with each other through their whole extent in the direction of the current, that if the last is not disposed of, the first is not at liberty to take up its place in the new combination which the powerful affinity of the most <b>active</b> <b>metal</b> tends to produce; and then the current itself is stopped; for the dependencies of the current and the decomposition are so mutual, that whichsoever be originally determined, i.e. the motion of the particles or the motion of the current, the other is invariable in its concomitant production and its relation to it.|$|E
