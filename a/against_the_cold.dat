5|$|As a defence <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> {{a colony}} of emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask to protect <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed {{a third of the}} season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E

25|$|Bompas {{eventually}} {{reached the}} Red River Colony, and from there, he was rowed by Salteaux Indians in Hudson's Bay Company boats. The Methye Portage was reached on October 12, {{too late to}} catch a boat going further north due to the ensuing winter. Bompas engaged a crew to row him further north, reaching Fort Chipewyan, Alberta after days of struggle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold.</b> Although {{he was invited to}} stay the winter at Fort Chipewyan, this offer was rejected, Bompas preferring to push further ahead. When the river became frozen over, his party continued by land, reaching the safety of Fort Resolution mid-winter. After a month's stay there, he was dispatched from there armed with snowshoes and a strong party. Bompas was determined to reach Fort Simpson before Christmas Day, and that he did, drawing into the entrance to the Fort on Christmas morning.|$|E
25|$|Already in 1883, Eckenfelder had {{exhibited}} his Überschwemmung im Neckarthal (Flooding in the Neckar Valley) at {{the international}} art exhibition in the Glaspalast in Munich. Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria purchased his painting Pferde vor dem Pflug (Ploughing Horses) in 1888 and Eckenfelder was {{for the first time}} mentioned in the specialist press. The prince regent took a lively interest in the artistic life of Munich and through such acquisitions supported young artists not only financially, but also with the renown they entailed. He often visited painters in their studios. When he paid his first such visit to Eckenfelder, it was a cold day and the artist was wrapped up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> and wearing thick winter slippers; Eckenfelder was so embarrassed that soon after he formed the habit of wearing dress shoes and a suit with no smock when working. He maintained this habit until late in life.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship has}} a massively built wooden hull {{designed}} to withstand being frozen {{into the ice}} and resist crushing. At {{the time of her}} launch Discovery was widely held to be the strongest wooden ship ever built. The hull frames, placed much closer together than was normal, were made of solid sections of oak up to 11inches (27.9cm) thick. The outer hull was formed from two layers - one 6inches (15.2cm) thick and an outer skin some 5inches (12.7cm) thick. A third lining was laid inside the frames, forming a double bottom and skin around almost the entire hull. This meant that in places the hull was over 2feet (60cm) thick, providing not only formidable strength but excellent insulation <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold.</b> The construction meant {{that it was impossible to}} install portholes (and fitting them would have weakened the hull) so the crew relied on 'mushroom vents' on the deck to allow air and light into the interior.|$|E

50|$|Originally this {{handmade}} fabric was woven by crofters for familial use, {{ideal for}} protection <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>colder</b> climate of <b>the</b> North of Scotland. Surplus cloth was often traded or used as barter, eventually becoming {{a form of}} currency amongst the islanders. For example, {{it was not unusual}} for rents to be paid in blankets or lengths of cloth. By the end of the 18th Century, the spinning of wool yarn from local raw materials was a staple industry for crofters. Finished handmade cloth was exported to the Scottish mainland and traded along with other commodities produced by the Islanders, such as dry hides, goat and deer skins.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> common <b>cold,</b> {{or simply}} cold, is a viral {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} upper respiratory tract. <b>The</b> <b>cold</b> is indeed common, and is a significant cause for absences from work and school. Even before the discovery of vitamin C, folklore had it that certain fruits were effective in both preventing and treating <b>the</b> <b>cold.</b> After scientific identification of vitamin C {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, research began into the possible effects of <b>the</b> vitamin <b>against</b> <b>the</b> common <b>cold.</b>|$|R
25|$|As ectotherms, Naultinus geckos {{will move}} to {{positions}} of higher or lower temperature in order to thermoregulate. Because Naultinus {{spend most of their}} time on the top of plant foliage, they gain much of their heat directly from the sun. Thus, control of the upper limits of temperature is achieved by moving from the outside of the foliage in areas of direct sunlight, to shaded areas beneath the outside of the vegetation. Control of the lower limits of temperature involves more movement for the animals. Because New Zealand has a temperate climate, Naultinus geckos live in areas which are at times (particularly in winter) exposed to very cold temperatures and high levels of rainfall. In such adverse weather animals will descend from an arboreal position in vegetation and seek shelter on the ground in and around the base of these same plants or under rocks and other debris, where they are insulated to some degree <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> air of the atmosphere. Because external temperatures essentially dictate rates of metabolism in ectotherms, the amount of food that these geckos will consume varies depending on the temperature and weather; they will feed frequently in spring and summer and much less in the colder seasons of autumn and winter.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E

50|$|El País {{newspaper}} {{carried an}} article in its October 6, 2013 edition that the hornet had been spotted in Val d'en Bas, Garrotxa, Catalonia, {{in the foothills of}} the Pyrenees. Efforts were made to locate the nests before the insects hibernate in November. After foot patrols failed to track the hornets down, a helicopter equipped with a thermal camera was making sweeps over the area. The flights during the morning chill, attempted to find the nest's 'heat signature' <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>colder</b> background. In September 2013, a beekeeper from Rasines, Cantabria documented the hornets' presence in 2 specimens. In June 2015, firemen pulled a nest of the hornet above a building entrance in Santander.|$|R

Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman {{standing in the}} shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> or sponge bathing.
