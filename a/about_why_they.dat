5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{has been}} fooled by Jeanie's lies <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> {{are not going}} out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch {{what happens in the}} wings during the {{upcoming}} Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet. Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight. Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as {{more and more of the}} dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer Phil Plait and NCSE writer Nick Matzke both wrote <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> {{thought the}} redefinition was not, in general, a good one. It defined a planet as orbiting a star, {{which would have}} meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a rogue planet) {{could not have been}} called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and brown dwarf stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.|$|E

The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments.

25|$|Although {{conscientiousness}} {{is generally}} {{seen as a}} positive trait to possess, recent {{research has suggested that}} in some situations it may be harmful for well-being. In a prospective study of 9570 individuals over four years, highly conscientious people suffered {{more than twice as much}} if they became unemployed. The authors suggested this may be due to conscientious people making different attributions <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> became unemployed, or through experiencing stronger reactions following failure. This finding is consistent with perspectives which see no trait as inherently positive or negative, but rather the consequences of the trait being dependent on the situation and concomitant goals and motivations.|$|E

Molecular biologist Jonathan Wells [...] criticizes biology textbooks by alleging that they continue to reproduce such evidence {{after it has been}} debunked. In response, the National Center for Science Education notes that none of the textbooks reviewed by Wells makes the claimed error, as Haeckel's drawings are shown in a historical context with discussion <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are wrong, and the accurate modern drawings and photos used in the textbooks are misrepresented by Wells.|$|E

500|$|Artificial intelligence, {{a unifying}} theme {{throughout}} Scott's {{career as a}} director, is particularly evident in Prometheus, primarily through the android David. David is like humans but {{does not want to}} be like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the Prometheus ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are seeking their own. Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David. At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.|$|E

Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They shoved a burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> were destroying parts of the city: [...] "Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening." [...] The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the break}} of dawn on 18 September (03:45), three Austrian columns {{attacked}} Kehl. The principal column, comprising the Regiment Ferdinand, crossed the Kinzig river above the French position and proceeded toward the dykes of the Rhine above Kehl. This placed them between Scherb and his force, and Kehl. Using the dykes as protection, and guided by some peasants {{who had been}} previously employed in strengthening the Kehl defenses, they advanced {{as far as the}} horn work on the Upper Rhine and entered a gorge which led them to the outskirts of the village. [...] The second column of the Regiment Ferdinand, under command of Major Busch, proceeded via Sundheim toward Kehl, and obtained possession of the village itself, although not the bridge leading to Strasbourg. The third column, which included three companies of Serbians and a division of hussars, executed a false feint on the left bank of the river. One corps of reserve under command of Colonel Pongratz, approached as far as the French earthworks {{on the banks of the}} Rhine to support the columns ahead of him; another, which included a battalion of the 12th Regiment, moved past the hamlet of Neumuhl (...) toward Kehl. Quickly, the Austrians possessed all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached one side of the abutment of the old palisade bridge and advanced to the other side, crossing the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. They halted almost under the eyes of the French sentinels; there is some confusion <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> stopped, but apparently they mistook the abutment for the last bridge itself.|$|E

I argue that we should reclaim the more traditional conception of public health as the provision of health-related public goods.

2500|$|In 2010, Pennsylvania {{received}} $141 {{million from}} the federal – US Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as [...] "persistently lowest achieving," [...] making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart – close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require {{at least half the}} faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.|$|E

The Bungalow Head was then given a [...] "secret word" [...] by Dick or Dom, such as [...] "windows". DCI Harry Batt would then enter.

6000|$|Idealism is only {{considering}} {{everything in}} its practical essence. Idealism only means that we should consider a poker in reference to poking before we discuss its suitability for wife-beating; that we should ask if an egg {{is good enough for}} practical poultry-rearing before we decide that the egg is bad enough for practical politics. But I know that this primary pursuit of the theory (which is but pursuit of the aim) exposes one to the cheap charge of fiddling while Rome is burning. A school, of which Lord Rosebery is representative, has endeavored to substitute for the moral or social ideals which have hitherto been the motive of politics a general coherency or completeness in the social system which has gained the nick-name of [...] "efficiency." [...] I am not very certain of the secret doctrine of this sect in the matter. But, as far as I can make out, [...] "efficiency" [...] means that we ought to discover everything about a machine except what it is for. There has arisen in our time a most singular fancy: the fancy that when things go very wrong we need a practical man. It would be far truer to say, that when things go very wrong we need an unpractical man. Certainly, at least, we need a theorist. A practical man means a man accustomed to mere daily practice, to the way things commonly work. When things will not work, you must have the thinker, the man who has some doctrine <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> work at all.
