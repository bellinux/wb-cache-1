40|$|Four-Character Sino-Japanese {{compounds}} are {{a productive}} word formation process in Japanese. There are many morpho-syntactic analyses on these compounds. However, {{little has been}} done on their lexical semantic structure. In this thesis I will provide a syntactically motivated classification system for these compounds, and a lexical semantic analysis of their structure. The lexical semantic analysis is extended to a potential application in Japanese-English Machine Translation. A lexical semantic analysis reveals that for compounds with a deverbal head, there is an argument relation between the constituents if the head’s lexical semantic requirement is fulfilled by the non-head constituent, while the relation is adjunct if it is not fulfilled. The constituents of compounds with a regular noun head are in an <b>attributive</b> <b>relation,</b> and the relation cannot seem to be determined by Lexical Semantics. Compounds with a de-adjectival head require more examples to draw firm conclusions because these compounds are rare...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a domain and genre-independent {{approach}} {{to identify the}} discourse relation called attributive, included in Grimes ’ relation list [7]. An <b>attributive</b> <b>relation</b> provides details about an entity or an event or {{can be used to}} illustrate a particular feature about a concept or an entity. Since attributive relations describe attributes or features of an object or an event, they are often used in text summarization (e. g. [2]) and question answering systems (e. g. [12]). However, to our knowledge, no previous work has focused on tagging attributive relations automatically. We propose an automatic domain and genre-independent approach to tag attributive relations by utilizing dependency relations of words based on dependency grammars [3]. In this paper, we also show how attributive relations can be utilized in text summarization. By using a subset of the BLOG 06 1 corpus, we have evaluated the accuracy of our attributive classifier and compared it to a baseline and human performance using precision, recall, and F-Measure. The evaluation results show that our approach compares favorably with human performance. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{investigate}} lexical sense relations {{through the application}} of linguistic knowledge, cognitive processes in colloquial speech and word association test. In a word association test, a list of words is presented to subjects, who is asked to respond with the first word that comes into their mind, and this gives information on the way knowledge structures in the human mind. To achieve this purpose, first, it has been needed to prepare appropriate words; therefore, 300 students of the faculty of letters and humanities have been asked to write the first word which comes to their mind. Totally, 3000 words have been assembled. 22 words, which have had the highest frequency, have been chosen among those words to be applied in the questionnaire. To achieve the aim of the research, 17 lexical relations have been proposed by the researchers. This study has convenience sampling with 110 subjects. It has been concluded that the lexical storage system is strongly dependent upon sense relations. Language speakers can radically alter the relation between words {{on the basis of their}} mental conceptions, although <b>Attributive</b> <b>relation,</b> Functional relation and Social...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper attempts to evaluate and quantify the use of discourse relations in the context of blog summarization and compare their use to more traditional and factual texts. Specifically, we measured the usefulness of 6 discourse relations - namely comparison, contingency, illustration, attribution, topic-opinion, and attributive for the task of text summarization from blogs. We have evaluated the effect of each relation using the TAC 2008 opinion summarization dataset and compared them with the results with the DUC 2007 dataset. The results show that in both textual genres, contingency, comparison, and illustration relations provide a significant improvement on summarization content; while attribution, topic-opinion, and <b>attributive</b> <b>relations</b> do not provide a consistent and significant improvement. These results indicate that, at least for summarization, discourse relations are just as useful for informal and affective texts as for more traditional news articles.

40|$|The {{so called}} Idafa {{construction}} {{is the central}} means for coding an <b>attributive</b> <b>relation</b> between two nominal phrases in Arabic. The semantics of the relation is rather vague, but it generally corresponds to a typical cross-linguistic concept of possession. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} way this construction is marked, using the fundamental distinction between dependent-marking and head-marking features, which is outlined in Nichols (1986). It turns out that the traditional label classifying Idafa as a genitive construction can be misleading, since the morphosyntactic role of the genitive ending is rather dubious and it is rather the head-marking features that signal the presence of the relation. However, these features seem a little obscure since they do not dwell in adding a affixu to the head noun, but rather in imposing certain restrictions on the head (only bare heads are allowed and the head is left unspecified for the category of definiteness). In addition, as the analysis is aimed at the natural spoken use of Modern Standard Arabic, I take into account the socio-pragmatic variation presented by the possibility of reducing the nominal endings in speech, approached insightfully in Magidow (2009). These reductions give rise to a slightly different structural view of the morphosyntax of this [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} clause players {{is crucial to}} {{modelling}} the topicality of a clause. Players are the animate carriers of topic, of action and performance in text.

These players can then be used iteratively to further refine the description of attitudinal clause patterns. CLAUSE PATTERNS The X really Y’d Z off It is W-ly Y to X. After hearing X, Z Y’d quite W.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} copular {{selection}} in Spanish and Catalan attributive clauses. We develop {{an analysis of}} the copular alternation that is based on the relation of coincidence. Locative attributives, the class of copular sentences that has received less attention in the literature, are analyzed in detail. It is concluded that locative attributives express an abstract path; that is, a terminal coincidence relation between a figure (the entity that is located) and a ground (the location). The use of estar in these sentences is justified by the fact that this copula has an interpretable terminal coincidence feature that can license its uninterpretable counterpart in the attributive clause. Nevertheless, ser –the default copula– can also co-occur in locative attributives when the notion of bounded path is already incorporated in the entity that is being located. This is the case in Catalan, which uses a –a preposition that expresses a limit– instead of en –a central coincidence preposition. The copula ser also appears in the location of eventive entities and in path noun constructions. The terminal coincidence feature of estar can also superimpose a delimiting aspectual boundary to the <b>attributive</b> <b>relation</b> when there is no uninterpretable terminal coincidence feature to value in it. In these cases, evidential and sensorial readings are conveyed. Finally, a possible analysis is sketched for the differences in the selection of the copula between Spanish and Catalan with participles and perfective adjectives. It is suggested that the selection of estar in these cases {{may be due to the}} fact that both classes have a weaker functional structure in Spanish than in Catalan...|$|E

40|$|In my {{investigation}} {{of the use of}} the perfect (part I) and of hyperbaton (part II) I address a cross-section of syntactical questions which reflect elements of the language of drama, of New Comedy, {{of the end of the}} classical period, of verse, and of a conversational register in a literary dialogue form at times naturalistic, and at others conventional, rhetorical, or formulaic. 1. I describe the use of the perfect indicative in Menander from various angles including a survey of the perfects found in Menander from verbs which were not previously attested in the perfect (1. 7); the notion of innovation is challenged in the face of the accident of attestation and the different genres of the different sources, and I refer to the general problems of studying a dead language. In the following section I describe the typical use of perfects by grammatical categories (2. 1), and extra- grammatical categories including discourse mode, sentence-type and non-hypotactic dependence (2. 2), and lexical criteria (2. 3). In the taxonomy of my description and in my analysis I apply the principle that verbal categories and their morphological manifestations are fluid and complex rather than discrete. For example, in my attempt to understand the use of the temporal value of the perfect I take into account compositional elements such as the use of adverbs (2. 1. 5); for mood, I try to illustrate the illocutionary wealth of the perfect indicative (2. 2. 2) and relate this to the relative absence of non-indicative perfect forms (2. 1. 3) as well as to the frequency of perfects in dialogue mode (2. 2. 1). The principle of the integration of categories, grammatical and metagrammatical, is seen in the correlation between the low incidence of perfects in subordinate clauses (4) and the exposure of other mechanisms for dependence (2. 2. 3) which are a particularly salient feature of the dialogue mode: dependence may be logical, or communicational ('stimulus and response' 2. 2. 3 b). Along with (2. 2. 3), and hypotactic subordination (4), I also consider the transitivity of the perfect (3), not only an exercise in description, but in order to argue that in Menander's time (and genre etc.) perfects are less often transitively used than not; I show that examples with direct objects display weak transitivity (3. 2. 1, 3. 2. 4). A relatively weak transitive use supports (although is not synonymous with) the argument that these are not 'resultative' perfects in the sense that they approach aorists. My primary aim is to describe the workings of the perfect and its syntactic environment in Menander, and not to enter into the controversy over the chronology of the resultative perfect. However, evidence points to Menander's retaining a classical use of the perfect quite distinct from the aorist: the perfect is not used as a narrative tense (5), and when it is found in narrative passages it either exits the narrative frame or serves as a border or as a rhetorical or structural 'signpost'. In (5) I also discuss some narrative patterns which are typical of New Comedy, and the consistent use of perfects in direct speech within a past setting. 2. Greek word order is 'free but not arbitrary', to quote Marouzeau. One of the less arbitrary features is the tendency for certain modifiers to be adjacent to their head noun. In part III examine the separation of four modifiers from the substantives they modify: numerals (2). indefinites (3), possessives (4) and the demonstrative OUTOC (5). I move from the inherently most closely cohering (numerals) to the most loosely (demonstratives are often interpreted as being in an appositive or predicative rather than an <b>attributive</b> <b>relation).</b> The enclitic forms, especially of possessives (4. 3), are more closely studied since they are also used in later classical Greek as an alternative to the dative forms of the enclitic pronouns in the 'sympathetic' function. In such cases (as with 'loose' demonstratives) the affiliation of the genitive enclitic must be reassessed. As an exercise in description, and in the principle of cumulative evidence, I try to interpret the effect created by the use of hyperbaton in terms of degrees of nuance, emotion, and disruption to the sentence. The nature of the intervening element and the structure of the rest of the sentence are important factors. In Menander's genre certain contexts recur, and certain nuances, tones and attitudes tend to be emphasized. </p...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} compounding in contemporary Portuguese. Conceived as a plurilexematic unit used as a holistic denomination, a compound is characterized by lexical atomicity. The continuum of compound classes that we propose {{is based on the}} morpho-lexical nature of the internal units (root, word) and on the (non) conformity of compound constructions with Portuguese syntactic templates. Since Portuguese compounds constitute a heterogeneous and borderline class, this analysis also focuses on the boundaries of compoundhood, namely those existing between compounds and phrasal nouns. This article also concentrates on the internal grammatical (coordinative, subordinative, <b>attributive)</b> and thematic <b>relations</b> and analyzes Portuguese compounds with respect to headedness in its morphological, semantic and categorical dimensions. Finally, we stress the existence of a narrow relationship between internal constituency, headedness and inflectional patterns of Portuguese compounds...|$|R

A familiarity-rating task has shown that 8 -year-olds judged concrete concepts as very familiar while abstract concepts were judged as much less familiar with ratings increasing substantially from age 10 to age 12, according to literature showing that abstract terms are not mastered until adolescence (Schwanenflugel, 1991). The types of relation elicited by abstract and concrete concepts during development were investigated in an association production task. At all considered age levels, concrete concepts mainly activated <b>attributive</b> and thematic <b>relations</b> as well as, to a much lesser extent, taxonomic relations and stereotypes. Abstract concepts, instead, elicited mainly thematic relations and, to a much lesser extent, examples and taxonomic relations. The patterns of relations elicited were already differentiated by age 8, becoming more specific in abstract concepts with age...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A logical {{formalism}} associating {{properties to}} space parcels in so-called attribute formulas, is proposed. Properties are related through the axioms of a taxonomy graph, and parcels through a partonomy graph. <b>Attributive</b> formulas establish <b>relations</b> between parcels and properties, {{and we use}} them to align different taxonomies, over a compatible partonomy, using Formal Concept Analysis. We discuss uncertainty in attributive formulas, which we extend in a possibilistic logic manner, including two modalities: true everywhere in the parcel, or at least true somewhere. Then, we discuss how our formalism can perform a possibilistic fusion on attributive formulas originating from independent sources, based on the aligned taxonomy. The issues may come from (a) the uncertainty of sources, (b) the possible inconsistency of fusion results, (c) the use of different partonomies that may not explicit the somewhere or everywhere reading associated to the information. Key words: spatial information, ontology, uncertainty, possibilistic logic, fusion.
