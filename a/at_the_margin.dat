5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not hairy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a hairy margin.|$|E
5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E

5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> of the continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is {{the formation of a}} slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of Stropharia caerulea {{feature a}} greenish-blue cap sparsely covered in white flecks of veil <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>margin,</b> and a sticky, glutinous surface texture. Gills on the cap {{underside}} have an adnate or sinuate {{attachment to the}} stipe. They are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. The greenish stipe is covered in white scales up to a thin, transient ring. It is similar in appearance to its less common relative Stropharia aeruginosa, but that species has a more robust ring on its stipe, more scales on the cap, and darker gills with white edges.|$|E

25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the least among all the goods in the range.

In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E
