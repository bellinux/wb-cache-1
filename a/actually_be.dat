Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.|$|E

In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth.

5|$|A {{study in}} 1993 by Segawa et al. {{revealed}} that the population of S.lessoniana in Okinawa may <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> composed of three distinct species. This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994. Triantafillos and Adams in 2005 also showed that S.lessoniana in Shark Bay, Australia is composed of two species. These findings indicate that S.lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species. It is now believed that S.lessoniana is a cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in sodium vapour street lights). This appears as an absorption line in many types of stars, including the Sun. The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E

5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first studies to examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E

5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were {{deposited in the}} shield stage of the volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were deposited in the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E

Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.|$|E
