5|$|Burial 6 was a cist located {{under the}} first chamber of the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49).

The bones belonged to two children <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> adult females and fragments of ceramic offerings were also identified.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker grasping the tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E

500|$|In August 2008 31-year-old {{social worker}} Margarita Lautin (...) , from Yehud, was killed while dining on the Bat Yam boardwalk {{with her husband}} <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> children.

500|$|Uncle Tupelo's third album, March 16–20, 1992, was {{released}} though Rockville Records on August 3, 1992. On the release, the band eschewed {{the growing popularity}} of alternative rock by playing acoustic folk and country songs [...] "as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene". Drummer Mike Heidorn had a reduced role on the album; because it was an acoustic album, Heidorn added only brush-stroke percussion on a few songs. Heidorn wanted to leave the band {{to spend more time with}} his wife <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> children. Though band manager Tony Margherita announced that several major labels were interested in signing Uncle Tupelo, Heidorn decided to permanently leave the band.|$|E

500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E
500|$|Bradley's {{death and}} Smith's {{acquittal}} made national headlines; detailed stories {{ran in the}} New York Times, the New York Herald, the Philadelphia North American, and Forest and Stream. [...] The warden's wife <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> children were given a home in Key West, paid for by donations secured by the Florida Audubon Society. [...] The Society, however, {{made no effort to}} replace Bradley, and his job as warden went unfilled. [...] Bradley's obituary, written by William Dutcher and published in August 1905's edition of Bird Lore, characterized him as [...] "fearless and brave." [...] Dutcher eulogized Bradley by saying, [...] "A faithful and devoted warden, who was a young and sturdy man, cut off in a moment, for what? [...] That a few more plume birds might be secured to adorn heartless women's bonnets. [...] Heretofore the price has been the life of the birds, now is added human blood. [...] Every great movement must have its martyrs, and Guy M. Bradley is the first martyr in bird protection." ...|$|E
500|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Howard (Melissa Leo) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} an Iowa woman who {{was shot to death}} in front of her husband Robert Ellison (Robin Williams) <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>young</b> children during a stick-up. Since the victims are tourists, the case becomes a [...] "red ball" [...] and receives considerable attention from the press, city officials and top police brass. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) tries to interview the two young children, but Ellison stops him, protesting that the experience is too hard on them. After obtaining information from street thugs, the police arrest Marvin (Antonio Charity), who possesses 45-caliber bullets matching those used in the shooting. Marvin tells the detectives that he's a [...] "stone stick-up man" [...] who has robbed dozens of people and never shot anyone because people don't argue with a [...]45-carrying man, and also that he knows he will spend decades in prison anyway because he was involved in the shooting so there is no reason he would lie about being the shooter. A mournful Ellison overhears Felton making jokes about the investigation and bragging about the overtime he expects to receive from it. He angrily demands Felton be thrown off the case, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calms him down by explaining the police have to be detached from the victims because they encounter so many. Ellison takes his children back to their hotel room, where his daughter Abby (Julia Devin) is in denial about her mother's death, and his son Matt (Jake Gyllenhaal) angrily refuses to talk to his father.|$|E
