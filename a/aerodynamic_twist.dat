5000|$|An <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> can be {{introduced}} to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called washout and causes the wing root to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the ailerons are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{achieving}} an arbitrary lift distribution with an arbitrary planform is presented. This is accomplished through optimizing <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> {{for a given}} number of either known airfoils or airfoils to be designed. The spanwise locations of these airfoils are optimized to get {{as close to the}} desired lift distribution as possible. Airfoils are linearly interpolated between these points. After <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist,</b> the planform is twisted geometrically using radial basis functions to model the twist distribution. The aerodynamic influence of each twist distribution is determined and all are superimposed to determine the function weights of each twist function, yielding the optimal twist to match the given lift. This method has been shown to match both an elliptical and a triangular lift distribution for an arbitrary planform. This method can also be used with any fidelity model, creating a powerful design tool...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine if twist deformation required {{for the design of}} full-scale extension-twist-coupled tilt-rotor blades can be achieved within material design limit loads, and to demonstrate the accuracy of a coupled-beam analysis in predicting twist deformations. Two extension-twist-coupled tilt-rotor blade designs were developed based on theoretically optimum <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> distributions. The designs indicated a twist rate requirement of between. 216 and. 333 deg/in. Agreement between axial tests and analytical predictions was within 10 percent at design limit loads. Agreement between the torsion tests and predictions was within 11 percent...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to present a methodology to predict the maximum lift of clean twisted wings. To this end, a methodology that couples aerodynamic input data from airfoils with a modified Weissinger method is implemented in a computational tool package. The model considers wings with break, sweep, and dihedral, whereas geometric and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twists</b> are properly considered {{by means of an}} interpolation technique. The analysis and validation procedure of the methodology is presented. A comparison with available data confirms both robustness and accuracy of the proposed numerical method...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{wings are}} mounted on hinges, restricting {{the extent to}} which their bases can be supinated for the upstroke. The {{forewings}} of many insects therefore include devices that allow the distal part of the wing to twist relative to the base under aerodynamic loading in the upstroke, but restrict such twisting in the downstroke where the effect would be detrimental. In the broad forewings of butterflies, this asymmetric resistance to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twisting</b> seems to be a consequence of the curved section of the leading edge. The wing can be modelled as a cantilevered, thin cambered plate. Torsional tests on the forewings of four butterfly species and on a paper wing of curved section confirm the effect. Differences between the results for the four species appear to fit their morphological and kinematic differences. The nature of the mechanism is outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Tall {{building}} {{developments have}} been rapidly increasing worldwide. This paper reviews {{the evolution of}} tall building’s structural systems and the technological driving force behind tall building developments. For the primary structural systems, a new classification – interior structures and exterior structures – is presented. While most representative structural systems for tall buildings are discussed, the emphasis in this review paper is on current trends such as outrigger systems and diagrid structures. Auxiliary damping systems controlling building motion are also discussed. Further, contemporary “out-of-the-box ” architectural design trends, such as <b>aerodynamic</b> and <b>twisted</b> forms, which directly or indirectly affect the structural performance of tall buildings, are reviewed. Finally, the future of structural developments in tall buildings is envisioned briefly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aerodynamic design {{optimization}} requires large computational resources, since each design evaluation requires {{the solution of}} a system of partial differential equations in a three di-mensional domain. Thus, the choice of optimization algorithm is critical, as it directly affects the number of required design evaluations to reach the optimum design. To help designers make an informed choice, we benchmark several optimization algorithms, including gradient-based and gradient-free methods using three test problems of increasing difficulty: a multi-dimensional Rosen-brock function, a RANS-based <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> optimization problem and an aerodynamic shape optimization problem. The majority of the gradient-based optimizers successfully solved all three test problems, while the gradient-free methods require two to three orders of magnitude more com-putational effort when compared to the gradient-based methods. Thus, gradient-based algorithms are the only viable option for solving large-scale aerodynamic {{design optimization}} problems...|$|E
40|$|Fixed wing micro air {{vehicles}} (wingspan between 10 and 15 cm) are aerodynamically challenging {{due to the}} low Reynolds number regime (104 - 105) {{they operate}} in. The low aspect ratio wings (typically used to maximize area under a size constraint) promote strong tip vortices, and are susceptible to rolling instabilities. Wind gusts can be of the same order of magnitude as the flight speed (10 - 15 m/s). Standard control surfaces on an empennage must be eliminated for size considerations and drag reduction, {{and the range of}} stable center of gravity locations is only a few millimeters long. Membrane aeroelasticity has been identified as a tenable method to alleviate these issues: flexible wing structures with geometric twist (adaptive washout for gust rejection, delayed stall) and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> (adaptive inflation for high lift, larger stability margins) are both considered here. Recent investigations in static aeroelastic characterization, including flight loads, wing deformation, flow structures, aeroelastic-tailoring studies through laminate orientation, as well as unconventional techniques based on membrane pre-tension, are reviewed. Multi-objective optimization aimed at improving lift, drag, and pitching moment considerations is also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{drive for}} ever more {{efficient}} aircraft structures stimulates the research {{to use the}} full potential of anisotropy of composite materials. The stiffness optimization of {{the upper and lower}} skins of a composite wing is demonstrated in this paper. The wing was optimized taking into consideration mass, strength, buckling, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> and aileron effectiveness. The elements of the inplane and bending stiffness matrices and laminate thicknesses were used as design variables. Static aeroelastic analysis was performed using Nastran to find the responses of the structure and their sensitivities to the design variables. The results of aeroelastic finite element analysis were processed to create efficient structural approximations of the responses. The approximations were used by a gradient based optimizer to update the design variables. The separable and continuous approximations in terms of the design variables allowed for the use of efficient parallel computing strategies, where single or multi-modal objective functions were minimized. The first numerical results for a generic wing confirmed a functional setup for multi load case stiffness optimizations with aeroelastic design responses. Stiffness optimized unbalanced laminates demonstrated a clear advantage over balanced laminates for mass or aileron effectiveness optimization, with constraints on strength and buckling...|$|E
40|$|An {{iteration}} method is presented {{by which the}} detailed <b>aerodynamic</b> loading and <b>twist</b> characteristics of a flexible wing with known elastic properties may be calculated. The method is applicable at Mach numbers approaching 1. 0 {{as well as at}} subsonic Mach numbers. Calculations were made for a wing-body combination; the wing was swept back 45 deg and had an aspect ratio of 4. Comparisons were made with experimental results at Mach numbers from. 0. 80 to 0. 98...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve <b>aerodynamic</b> performance, a <b>twist</b> {{criterion}} was used to design the canard and wing lifting surfaces of two graphite-epoxy research aircraft. To meet that twist criterion, the lifting surfaces were tailored using graphite-epoxy tape. The outer surface of the aircraft is essentially constructed of 95 percent graphite epoxy materials. The analytical tools and methodology used to design those lifting surfaces are described. One aircraft was subjected to an 8 g ground test in order to verify structural integrity and to determine how well the desired twist was achieved. Test results are presented and the reductions of both flight and ground strain test gages and their associated stresses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Numerical methods {{incorporated}} into a computer program to provide estimates of the subsonic <b>aerodynamic</b> performance of <b>twisted</b> and cambered wings of arbitrary planform with attainable thrust and vortex lift considerations are described. The computational system {{is based on a}} linearized theory lifting surface solution which provides a spanwise distribution of theoretical leading edge thrust in addition to the surface distribution of perturbation velocities. The approach used relies on a solution by iteration. The method also features a superposition of independent solutions for a cambered and twisted wing and a flat wing of the same planform to provide, at little additional expense, results for a large number of angles of attack or lift coefficients. A previously developed method is employed to assess the portion of the theoretical thrust actually attainable and the portion that is felt as a vortex normal force...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between the fluid and structure on an MAV can {{have a significant effect}} on the nature of the aerodynamic characteristics and stability of the vehicle. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>twist</b> can be designed into the wing through the use of a soft wing material, to adaptively increase the wing camber. This investigation is concerned with the deformation of a depron-foam flying wing MAV under aerodynamic loading. Depron foam shows a moderate rigidity which is neither too rigid as carbon fibre nor too soft as a membrane skin. The proper deformation at wingtip under the aerodynamic loading forms a desirable dihedral angle which can deform into a proper designed dihedral angle and improve rolling stability. In the study, carbon fibre rods were attached underneath the wing to improve wing strength in order to form a desired dihedral angle. The aerodynamic performance of the strengthen wing has shown that the desired deformation increases as the incidence rises and causes a significant pressure redistribution which increases both lift and drag. Wing deformation also minimise the complex vortical flow on the upper wing surface, corresponding to a drag reduction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the variable cross section spar (VCSpar) concept that facilitates varying the shear center position {{relative to the}} aerodynamic center, allowing the external <b>aerodynamic</b> loads to <b>twist</b> the structure and maintain its deformed shape. The VCSpar is considered in this paper as integrated within the wing of a representative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to enhance its flight performance and control authority. A preliminary design {{study was conducted to}} assess the potential benefits of the concept using a low-fidelity design tool. Then, aeroelastic modeling of the concept was performed where the VCSpar was modeled as a two-dimensional equivalent aerofoil using bending and torsion shape functions to express the equations of motion in terms of the twist angle and plunge displacement at the wingtip. The aerodynamic lift and moment acting on the equivalent aerofoil were modeled using Theodorsen’s unsteady aerodynamic theory. A low-dimensional state-space representation of an empirical Theodorsen’s transfer function was adopted to allow time-domain analyses...|$|R
40|$|A model insect wing is {{described}} in which spars of corrugated membrane which incorporate stiffening veins branch serially from a V-section leading edge spar. The mechanical behaviour of this model is analysed. The open, corrugated spars possess great resistance to bending, but are compliant in torsion. Torsion of the leading edge spar will result in torsion and relative movement of the rear spars. As a result camber will automatically be {{set up in the}} wing as it <b>twists.</b> <b>Aerodynamic</b> forces produced during the wing strokes will result in torsion and camber of the wing which should improve its aerodynamic efficiency. The effects of varying parameters of the wing model are examined. For given wing torsion, higher camber is given by spars branching from the leading edge at a lower angle, by spars which curve posteriorly, and by spars which diverge from each other. Wings of three species of flies were each subjected to two series of mechanical tests. Application of a force behind the torsional axis caused the wings to twist and to develop camber. Immobilizing basal regions of the leading edge greatly reduced compliance to torsion and camber, as predicted by the theoretical model. Aerodynamic forces produced during a half-stroke are sufficient to produce observed values of torsion and camber, and to maintain changes in pitch caused by inertial effects at stroke reversal...|$|R
40|$|To further {{improve the}} BO 105 {{helicopter}} {{mainly from the}} performance and comfort point of view, {{a new version of}} the aircraft was launched through fitting the four-bladed hingeless rotor system with advanced geometry rotor blades and installing an upgraded main gearbox. The newness of the rotor blades consists in an improved <b>aerodynamic</b> (airfoils, planform, <b>twist)</b> and structural/dynamic layout whereas the fundamental rotor characteristics like stiffness, damping, etc. remained unchanged. The new rotor blades were extensively tested in wind tunnel, on whirl tower, and in flight. The new aerodynamic blade design results in a considerable reduction of power required which is equivalent to a payload increase up to 130 kg in hover condition. The optimised blade dynamics lead in combination with reworked C. F. pendulum absorbers to an essential decrease of the cabin vibration level. The application of advanced materials and the introduction of new manufacturing procedures/processes help to improve the reliability and to reduce the costs. A survey of the rotor design rationale, the main characteristics, and the most important test results is presented concentrating upon the fields of handling qualities, vibratory loading, noise, and performance. In connection with the later one, special emphasis is laid on operational aspects including an improved Category A capability. (orig.)

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to review literature for the most suitable aeroelastic tailoring analysis tools for long slender composite structures, and integrate them into an aeroelastic tailoring process. The JS 1 C Revelation is a high performance sailplane made from modern composites, mostly carbon fibre. This has the advantage of being more rigid than traditional engineering materials, thereby reducing the effects of the twisting deflections on these long slender structures due to aerodynamic loads. The implementing of aeroelastic tailoring can create bend-twist couples for performance improvements. Composites enable the use of aeroelastic tailoring to improve gliding performance. Flaperon 3 of the JS 1 C 21 m was used as the design problem for aeroelastic tailoring. Aeroelastic tailoring was done by analysing the flaperon structure at the different layup angles to determine the correct design point to tailor the structure to improve aerodynamic performance at thermalling and cruise, but mostly cruise since it accounts for 70 % of the flight time. The composite structure analysis tool has the objective to get results during concept design. This directed the line of research of analysis tools to a solution method of two dimensional cross-section mesh properties projected onto a one dimensional beam. The literature of Hodges had good verification and published data on the analysis tools. The analysis tools comprised of three programs that were not very user friendly. Thus the author compiled a Matlab program as a user interface tool to run the three programs together. The aeroelastic tailoring process systematically works through the known design variables and objectives, which are given as inputs to the analysis tool. The analysis tool plots the coupling data versus layup angle. From this the best layup angles for a sought-after bend-twist couple is used to aeroelastically tailor the wing. The composite structure analysis tool’s accuracy was verified by analysing cantilever beam deflections and comparing the results with hand calculations and SolidWorks Simulation FEM results. The analysis tool’s accuracy was further verified by comparing the <b>aerodynamic</b> torsional load’s <b>twist</b> deflections with thin walled tube theory. The analysis tool was validated by applying a torsional load at the tip of a JS 1 C production Flaperon 3 in an experimental setup and then comparing this result with the Flaperon 3 modelled in the analysis tool. These comparisons also ensured that the model’s composite material properties and the meshing of the flaperon cross-sectional properties were correct. This aeroelastic tailoring was validated with the advantage of then being used to improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C Revelation 21 m tip’s flaperon. This improvement could be made by making use of a tailored bend-twist couple to reduce the effect of the <b>aerodynamic</b> load’s <b>twist</b> deflections. A test sample of the JS 1 C 21 m flaperon 3 was used to validate aeroelastic tailoring. The test sample was designed to be 1 m in length and have all the specified tailoring coupling characteristics that could improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C 21 m flaperon 3. The test sample was manufactured according to Jonker Sailplanes manufacturing standards and experimentally set up with the same applied deflections as in the analysis tool. The calculated bend-twist values and the experimental setup results were similar with a negligible difference, assuming small displacements and an aspect ratio greater than 13; this confirmed that the PreVABS/VABS/GEBT composite structure analysis tool could be used in aeroelastic tailoring to predict and design the bend-twist couple needed to improve the aerodynamic performance of the JS 1 C 21 m. While the twist behaviour of Flaperon 3 was improved by the tailored bend-twist couple, it was still necessary to add pre-twist as well, to fully address the effects of <b>twisting</b> by <b>aerodynamic</b> forces.
