[...] Rolling Stones David Fricke, reviewing Doolittle, said [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was [...] "a corrosive, compelling meditation on God and garbage." [...] The critical success of [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was also reflected commercially; the song reached number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, marking the Pixies' debut in the American charts.

Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E

500|$|As {{the police}} claimed {{that there were}} no {{surviving}} papers in the case, and the senior investigating officers had since died, Chand relied largely upon newspaper cuttings to piece together what had happened. Chand, who acted pro bono for Hodgson, said of his investigation: [...] "The search was the most difficult thing I have encountered in my personal and professional life. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. I spent months chasing false leads and implacable bureaucracy but I was not prepared to accept this, as instinct told me that the samples would be somewhere. I persevered because I had <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> that something was wrong." [...] Eventually, Chand's probing led to the rediscovery of an archive of evidence on an industrial estate in the Midlands [...] "which they appeared to have forgotten about". Stored here were all of the swabs taken by the pathologist in December 1979. In December 2008 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) notified Julian Young of the initial results of the DNA analysis, and on 30January 2009 it was confirmed that the semen detected on the vaginal and the anal swabs could not have originated from Hodgson.|$|E

Assistant coach John Spencer was also let go, {{and was replaced by}} Covelo. The timing of the firing came as somewhat of a surprise, as it was announced hours after San Jose defeated Real Salt Lake 2–1 at home. Fioranelli said of the firing that, coming off of a win, it was not reactionary, and rather he had [...] "in the last two to three months...matured <b>a</b> <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> as to where [...] ", and that his respect for Kinnear [...] "would not have allowed [...] to want to go for another three months knowing [...] would have parted ways {{at the end of the}} season". In his first interview as head coach, Leitch reiterated Fioranelli's previously stated goals, saying that [...] "the goal of the team...is [...] make the playoffs". His first outing as head coach on June 28, 2017, was successful, seeing the Earthquakes achieve their first-ever victory over an MLS side in the U.S. Open Cup with a 2–1 victory against Seattle Sounders FC that would advance them to the USOC quarter finals for the first time since 2012.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physicians' {{clinical}} decision-making may {{be influenced}} by non-analytical thinking, especially when perceiving uncertainty. Incidental <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice have been described, namely, as "a sense of alarm" and "a sense of reassurance". <b>A</b> Dutch <b>Gut</b> <b>Feelings</b> Questionnaire (GFQ) was developed, validated and afterwards translated into English following a linguistic validation procedure. The aims were to translate the GFQ from English into French, German and Polish; to describe uniform elements as well as differences and difficulties in the linguistic validation processes; to propose a procedural scheme for future GFQ translations into other languages. METHODS: We followed a structured, similar and equivalent procedure. Forward and backward-translations, repeated consensus procedures and cultural validations performed in six steps. Exchanges between the several research teams, the authors of the Dutch GFQ, and the translators involved continued throughout the procedure. RESULTS: 12 translators, 52 GPs and 8 researchers in the field participated to the study in France, Germany, Switzerland and Poland. The collaborating research teams created three versions of the 10 -item GFQ. Each research team found and agreed on compromises between comparability and similarity on one hand, and linguistic and cultural specificities on the other. CONCLUSIONS: The <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> questionnaire is now available in five European languages: Dutch, English, French, German and Polish. The uniform procedural validation scheme presented, and agreed upon by the teams, can be used for the translation of the GFQ into other languages. Comparing results of research into the predictive value of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> and into the significance of the main determinants in five European countries is now possible...|$|R
40|$|Mass specs are precise but {{biology is}} not!’ is a {{frequently}} heard argument when quantitative experimental {{data do not}} fit into the overall picture. The problem with this opinion is that the significance of measured biological data becomes <b>a</b> matter of <b>gut</b> <b>feeling.</b> Doubtlessly, the measurement precision of modern mass spectrometers is far better than the reproducibility of biological experiments. However, precisely for this reason, technical reproduction of mass spectrometric measurements neither characterizes the whole experiment from cell cultivation to producing biological data nor says anything about systematic errors in the overall measurement procedure. Taking quantitative metabolomics as a fruitful example, {{we deal with the}} question of why it is so difficult to say something precise about imprecision in biology...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1965, Stanley Pollitt {{felt that}} account {{managers}} were using information incompetently or inexpediently because the researcher {{was not involved}} in the campaign process. Because of this, Pollitt suggested that a specially trained researcher should work with the account manager as an equal partner. After the opening of the Boase Massimi Pollitt (BMP) agency, in 1968, Pollitt introduced his idea, only slightly revised. Stephen King, believing that clients deserved a better way of doing things, proposed a process of advertising development that had <b>a</b> little less <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> and <b>a</b> little more scientific foundation. This process involved rigorous analysis of a brand and its position in the competitive market place. This process creates an advertising message from the marketing objectives and the client’s business objectives. In 1968, J.

5000|$|Sandback is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} Minimalist works made from lengths of colored yarn. The artist's early interest in stringed musical instruments led him to make dulcimers and banjos as a teenager. In 1967, he produced the sculpture that would establish the terms of his mature work. Using string and wire, he outlined {{the shape of a}} 20-foot-long 2-by-4 board lying on the floor. Though he employed metal wire and elastic cord early in his career, the artist soon dispensed with mass and weight by using acrylic yarn. His yarn, elastic cord, and wire sculptures define edges of virtual shapes that ask the viewer's brain to perceive the rest of the form. In that way his work can be considered visionary or imaginative, as well as minimal and literal. Indeed, Sandback was fond of installing [...] "corner" [...] pieces whose shadows assist with this form completion process. In describing his work he stated, [...] "It's a consequence of wanting the volume of sculpture without the opaque mass that I have the lines." [...] and [...] "I did have <b>a</b> strong <b>gut</b> <b>feeling</b> from the beginning though, and that was wanting {{to be able to make}} sculpture that didn't have an inside." [...] Sandback himself referred to his sculptures operating in pedestrian space, acknowledging both the viewer’s movement through a space and as something to be engaged actively.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{practitioners}} sometimes base clinical {{decisions on}} <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> alone, {{even though there}} is little evidence of their diagnostic and prognostic value in daily practice. Research into these aspects {{and the use of the}} concept in medical education require a practical and valid description of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings.</b> The goal of our study was therefore to describe the concept of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice and to identify their main determinants METHODS: Qualitative research including 4 focus group discussions. A heterogeneous sample of 28 GPs. Text analysis of the focus group discussions, using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings</b> are familiar to most GPs in the Netherlands and play a substantial role in their everyday routine. The participants distinguished two types of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> <b>a</b> sense of reassurance and a sense of alarm. In the former case, a GP is sure about prognosis and therapy, although they may not always have a clear diagnosis in mind. A sense of alarm means that a GP has the feeling that something is wrong even though objective arguments are lacking. GPs in the focus groups experienced <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> as <b>a</b> compass in situations of uncertainty and the majority of GPs trusted this guide. We identified the main determinants of gut feelings: fitting, alerting and interfering factors, sensation, contextual knowledge, medical education, experience and personality. CONCLUSION: The role of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice has become much clearer, but we need more research into the contributions of individual determinants and into the test properties of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> to make the concept suitable for medical education...|$|R

40|$|Background: General {{practitioners}} (GPs) {{are often}} faced with complicated, vague problems {{in situations of}} uncertainty {{that they have to}} solve at short notice. In such situations, <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> seem to play a substantial role in their diagnostic process. Qualitative research distinguished a sense of alarm and a sense of reassurance. However, not every GP trusted their <b>gut</b> <b>feelings,</b> since <b>a</b> scientific explanation is lacking. Objective: This paper explains how <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> arise and function in GPs' diagnostic reasoning. Approach: The paper reviews literature from medical, psychological and neuroscientific perspectives. Conclusions: <b>Gut</b> <b>feelings</b> in general practice are based on the interaction between patient information and a GP's knowledge and experience. This is visualized in a knowledge-based model of GPs' diagnostic reasoning emphasizing that this complex task combines analytical and non-analytical cognitive processes. The model integrates the two well-known diagnostic reasoning tracks of medical decision-making and medical problem-solving, and adds <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> as <b>a</b> third track. Analytical and non-analytical diagnostic reasoning interacts continuously, and GPs use elements of all three tracks, depending on the task and the situation. In this dual process theory, <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> emerge as <b>a</b> consequence of non-analytical processing of the available information and knowledge, either reassuring GPs or alerting them that something is wrong and action is required. The role of affect as a heuristic within the physician's knowledge network explains how <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> may help GPs to navigate in a mostly efficient way in the often complex and uncertain diagnostic situations of general practice. Emotion research and neuroscientific data support the unmistakable role of affect in the process of making decisions and explain the bodily sensation of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings.</b> The implications for health care practice and medical education are discussed.

40|$|Introduction: Gut feelings; {{the uncomfortable}} feeling that {{something}} is wrong while specific indications are lacking, are a common feature among general practitioners (GPs) and are often related to a suspicion of cancer. Although there is little evidence of the prognostic value of these feelings, it is known that such sense of alarm can activate the GPs’ diagnostic behaviour. Studies show that early recognition of symptoms may contribute to early detection of cancer and is an important factor for prognosis and survival. In this way, one might expect that <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> can help predict and prevent serious disease and it will be of great value to assess the evidence of these feelings. Objective: To examine the causes of cancer-related <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> amongst GPs in the Netherlands, to describe the therapeutic actions that were driven by these feelings and to investigate whether the symptoms that caused the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> have ultimately lead to a cancer diagnosis. Methods: Data were collected via the Dutch Sentinel General Practice Network; a network of 42 general practices, nationally representative by age, gender, regional distribution and population density. From January 2010, all GPs were asked to fill in questionnaires for each patient causing a gutfeeling that he/she may have cancer. After three months, the GPs were asked to complete a second questionnaire, evaluating patient’s final diagnosis. Results: A total of 124 questionnaires were completed in 2010. The GPs indicated that the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> were caused by: unexplained weight loss, consultation of a patient who rarely visits the GP, smoking, a palpable tumor (especially in the breast), icterus, an irregular hematogram or extension of symptoms. Preliminary results show that the <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> lead to <b>a</b> diagnosis in 63 % of the cases and in 60 % of the cases this was a diagnosis of cancer. However in the majority of cases (56 %) it was not the diagnosis anticipated initially. Conclusions: The study confirms that <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> may be <b>a</b> useful although not a precise instrument in the early diagnosis of cancer in general practice. Further studies in triggers of <b>gut</b> <b>feelings</b> are recommended. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
