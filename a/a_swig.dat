500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally Pete was to take <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E
500|$|The {{show had}} an expandable, five-platform stage which {{displayed}} the album's cover art. Madonna, wearing a skintight black {{suit and a}} lace top, appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick, as the music of [...] "Candy Shop" [...] started. Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking {{the back of the}} stage. Madonna, along with her six dancers, gyrated in choreographed dance moves. Next, Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar, took <b>a</b> <b>swig</b> from a champagne bottle and started singing [...] "Miles Away", as images of planes taking off and landing, airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her. After that [...] "4 Minutes" [...] was performed, which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock. Then Madonna paused for a moment to thank her collaborators, including Timberlake, West, Timbaland and others. [...] "I feel like the luckiest girl in the world", she said, before dedicating the next song, [...] "Hung Up" [...] from 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, to her fans. The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction". It was followed by [...] "Give It 2 Me", during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd. The show ended with a performance of [...] "Music" [...] (2000), during which her dancers emerged from a false, silver subway car door. Madonna danced across the stage, touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors, behind which she disappeared.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 Heinze {{wrote an}} opinion {{piece for the}} Examiner, [...] "The Vatican Repents Catholic Anti-Semitism;" [...] it focused on the long-awaited and newly {{released}} document, , published by Cardinal Edward Cassidy, President of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. The document had caused heated controversy; many critics argued that it didn't go far enough in taking responsibility for the past. Heinze's Examiner article opened {{with the story of}} Bernard Lichtenberg, a Catholic priest who was arrested in 1941 by the Berlin Gestapo because he had publicly prayed for the Jews; after his arrest, Lichtenberg asked to be sent away with the Jews so that he could pray for their welfare. He spent the next two years in a Nazi prison camp and died on his way to Dachau. After telling the story of Father Lichtenberg, Heinze gave his opinion of the We Remember document. He agreed with the critics that [...] "The Catholic Church must reckon with historical fact, proving its awareness of sin in high places." [...] "But," [...] he added, [...] "the rest of us must encourage the message of repentance and renewal the church is preaching to its followers because, in the end, that is what produces people such as Bernard Lichtenberg." [...] It was an opinion piece that encouraged reconciliation, not anger. Two years later Heinze invited Cardinal Cassidy to San Francisco to participate in <b>a</b> <b>Swig</b> [...] lecture on interfaith understanding. Cardinal Cassidy accepted the invitation.|$|E

40|$|Extract] The 'taste of victory' is {{a phrase}} many {{associate}} with trained athletes preparing for intense competition. Indeed, Ed Chambers {{and colleagues at}} the University of Birmingham and Manchester Metropolitan University have started unravelling the physiology behind that phrase. When <b>a</b> cyclist <b>swigs</b> <b>a</b> sports drink prior to a race, we relate the energy boost to the sugary calories ingested. However, {{there may be more}} to this effect than the pure metabolic benefits of ingesting carbohydrates, as the benefits are lost if the carbohydrates are infused intravenously. Chambers' team hypothesized that because some taste receptors are connected to the brain region responsible for pleasure and reward, this boost phenomenon may start in the athlete's mouth. They wondered whether carbohydrates stimulate the brain so that it motivates the body to physiologically prepare to perform...|$|R
