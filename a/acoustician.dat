5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and <b>acoustician</b> John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took twice as long as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E

40|$|The new ISO 12913 - 1 {{introduces}} a conceptional {{framework for the}} ”Soundscape” approach and refers to ”factors relevant for measurement and reporting of soundscape studies, as well as planning, design and management of soundscape”. This emphasises a common ground to Soundscape for <b>Acousticians</b> and Architects/Urban Designers (among others) : for <b>Acousticians</b> to investigate sound qualities {{in relation to their}} specific context, and for Architects/Urban Designers to pro-actively implement sound qualities into their designs. However, both professions usually come from fundamentally different perspectives: <b>Acousticians</b> rather act as ”analysts”: they observe specific environments in order to derive findings, such as patterns, generalisations or rules; Architects tend to do the exact opposite and act as ”synthesizers”: they use patterns, generalisations and rules, in order to integrate them into the design of a specific environment. Consequently, the expectations and outcome of a ”standardisation” approach may differ significantly. The paper discusses the underlying triangulation principle of the soundscape-approach based on ”people-context-acoustic environment” against a proposed similar triangulation of the Architectural/Urban design process based on ”programme-context-idea”. It explores the potentials of the Soundscape approach from an Architect’s view and the way it could be enhanced by an interdisciplinary approach as anticipated in the new ISO...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{number of}} {{underwater}} activities and experiments in tropical waters has been growing; people are increasingly becoming {{interested in the}} development of underwater applications that rely on acoustic communications. Ambient noise is a limiting factor in the performance of underwater acoustic detection and communication systems at shallow water. Knowledge of ambient noise characteristics at a location will be helpful for ambient noise imaging systems like ROMANIS, built at Acoustic Research Laboratory. The Singapore straits and surrounding waters contain some of the busiest shipping channels in the world. Monitoring of ambient noise is of crucial interest to <b>acousticians</b> and oceanographers due to the high level of shipping and snapping shrimp noise in the region. Since there was no such systematic ambient noise database existing to support oceanographers and <b>acousticians,</b> the Acousti...|$|R
25|$|The {{technical}} requirements and exacting standards required of a facility like the Kauffman Center made {{it one of}} the most complex structures in the world to design and build. The building, which took nearly five years to complete, contains 40,000 square feet of glass, 25,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 27 steel cables. The main lobby, Brandmeyer Great Hall, is built of a glass ceiling and sloping glass walls that provide a panoramic view of Kansas City to the south. The twenty-seven steel cables on the south façade are anchored in embeds that weigh approximately one and a half tons, and the embeds are an extension of the foundation and bedrock beneath the building. When the steel cables were pulled taut during the construction process, the entire steel structure shifted two to six inches to the south. This tensioning provides stability to the structure and keeps the glass lobby securely in place. The Kauffman Center covers 13 acres (53,000 m2), including landscaped grounds over the 1,000-space, city-owned Arts District Garage. The cost of the project was approximately $413 million, which includes both a $40 million operating endowment and the city’s $47 million construction of the parking garage. The Kauffman Center was designed by lead architect Moshe Safdie, <b>acoustician</b> Yasuhisa Toyota, theater consultant Theatre Projects Consultants and Richard Pilbrow, and engineering firm Arup. Local firm BNIM was the associate architect. Lead contractor was J.E. Dunn Construction Group of Kansas City.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dimensions}} and key {{system of the}} modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely {{the work of the}} great flautist, composer, <b>acoustician,</b> and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. It was immediately popular, and spread worldwide in just a few years. Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost exactly as he designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large straight tube bore, [...] "parabolic" [...] tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the [...] "crutch" [...] for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G key over an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys.|$|E

40|$|Working with {{textiles}} in {{an acoustic}} context gives enormous possibilities {{to combine the}} acoustic function of materials with the visual function (aesthetics). Depending on the material choice and the production techniques, textiles may for instance be flexible, stiff, airtight, have high density or high porosity. Designing acoustic textiles and applying them in an efficient way in practice demands knowledge and understanding among both <b>acousticians</b> and textile designers. This knowledge and understanding has to concern both textiles and their manufacturing processes {{as well as the}} acoustic performance of space and how different treatment influences this performance. The aim of this thesis is to offer textile designers the possibility to learn more about acoustics and the design of textiles with respect to an required acoustic performance. It will hopefully also assist <b>acousticians</b> to identify proper textiles for the acoustic treatment of spaces and in this way motivate the further development of textiles for acoustic purposes. The thesis starts with two sections which provide an introduction for <b>acousticians</b> into the world of textiles and an introduction for textile designers into the world of acoustics. This is followed by a discussion concerning the developing process of textiles for acoustic purposes. The conclusion from this discussion is that the potential of textiles might be best utilized if the textiles are designed for a specific case. This is demonstrated for a classroom where the acoustic performance is studied in detail. The results from the classroom study show the possibilities how the acoustic textiles could be designed. The usual goal of maximum absorption obtained low priority, while textiles with rather moderate absorption placed in sufficient surface and in appropriate positions showed to have the highest potential for improving the acoustic quality of the classroo...|$|R
