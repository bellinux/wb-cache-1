Background: Numerous {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} {{composite}} materials, commonly used for restorations in conservative dentistry, and in orthodontics to <b>anchor</b> <b>brackets</b> to the tooth enamel, have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. The study determined expression of p 53, p 63 and p 16, biomarkers useful for predicting potential genotoxicity. Patients and Methods: p 53, p 63 and p 16 expression was determined immunohistochemically in the gingival papillae of 99 patients (69 banded orthodontically for at least one year, brackets bonded to teeth with filled flowable composite resin, 30 without orthodontic banding as controls). The papillae samples were removed surgically and examined to evaluate morphological and biological alterations. Results: In no case were morphological alterations visible by microscopy out of the 69 bande...|$|E

40|$|Brake squeal {{is defined}} as a {{phenomenon}} of dynamic instability that occurs at {{one or more of the}} natural frequencies of the brake system. When brake is unstable lead to vibration of structure and occurs noise. The main of noise caused by friction material, the couple of pads and rotor, beside have more components of brake system like caliper, <b>anchor</b> <b>bracket,</b> knuckle and suspension. Pads and rotor coupling has major impact on mid to high frequency. This paper shows the the a method to identify brake squeal by finite element menthod (FEM), It base on solve complex eigenvalue and find out the real part and imagrine part.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} {{composite}} materials, commonly used for restorations in conservative dentistry, and in orthodontics to <b>anchor</b> <b>brackets</b> to the tooth enamel, have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. The study determined expression of p 53, p 63 and p 16, biomarkers useful for predicting potential genotoxicity.

The papillae samples were removed surgically and examined to evaluate morphological and biological alterations. Results: In no case were morphological alterations visible by microscopy out of the 69 banded patients; four (5. 80 %>) were positive for p 53 and two for p 63 expression in the basal and suprabasal layers (2. 90 %). One patient was positive for p 16 (1. 45 %). No control case was positive for any of the biomarkers (0. 00 %). Conclusion: The significance of p 53, p 63 and p 16 positivity, and whether these proteins may serve as biomarkers to predict the risk of developing oral lesions (dysplasia, oral cancer) is still unclear. Although details of the mechanisms leading to cell death, genotoxicity and cell-cycle delay are not fully understood, resin monomers may alter cell function in the oral cavity...|$|E
5000|$|McKenzie River dories are {{specialized}} to run rapids on rivers, {{and first}} appeared on the McKenzie River in Oregon in the mid-20th century. A prolific McKenzie River dory boat builder in the 1940s and 1950s was Wood [...] "Woodie" [...] Knoble Hindman. Woodie had learned to build these steep rocker boats from master boat builder Torkel [...] "Tom" [...] Kaarhus. The McKenzie River dory Woodie made had a pronounced continuous rocker with a wide flat bottom for low draft, a narrow bow that is flat, often mistaken for the transom, which instead is pointed. The {{reason for this is}} that the rower faces downstream, therefore the part of the boat which first hits the waves (approaching from behind) must be pointed or very narrow to throw the water to the side. The bow is then widened so that a small <b>anchor</b> <b>bracket</b> can be attached. Those unfamiliar with the craft would say that they are rowed backwards. McKenzie dories without a transom are called [...] "double-enders".|$|R

40|$|In the {{experimental}} module of the AHEAD 1995 data, {{the sample is}} randomly split into respondents who get an open-ended question {{on the amount of}} total family consumption - with follow-up unfolding brackets (of the form: is consumption $X or more?) for those who answer "don√ït know" or "refuse" - and respondents who are immediately directed to unfolding brackets. In both cases, the entry point of the unfolding bracket sequence is randomized. These data are used to develop a nonparametric test for whether people make mistakes in answering the first bracket question, allowing for any type of selection into answering the open-ended question or not. Two well-known types of mistakes are considered: anchoring and yea-saying (or acquiescence). While the literature provides ample evidence that the entry point in the first bracket question serves as an <b>anchor</b> for follow-up <b>bracket</b> questions, it is less clear whether the answers to the first bracket question are already affected by anchoring. We reject the joint hypothesis of no anchoring and no yea-saying at the entry point.

40|$|A non-proprietary, cable {{guardrail}} {{system is}} currently under {{development for the}} Midwest States Pooled Fund Program. A cable guardrail end terminal was necessary to accompany the cable guardrail system. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for the cable end terminal. Bogie testing that was previously completed on a design concept indicated delayed cable release, which was an undesired performance that led to vehicle instabilities. Several design changes were recommended for better end terminal performance and to reflect the changes made to the cable median barrier. An LS-DYNA model of the modified cable end terminal was developed. Simulations of 0 - and 15 -degree impacts {{on the end of}} the cable <b>anchor</b> <b>bracket</b> with a bogie model indicated that the cables would release easily and not induce vehicle instabilities. This behavior still needs to be verified through bogie and full-scale crash testing. Simulations of a 25 -degree reverse impact between post nos. 2 and 3 with small car models indicated that cables did not release easily and may interlock around the car resulting in excessive vehicle decelerations or instabilities. Simulations of various line post designs found that the MWP and weakened MWP have lower forces and energies during impact than the S 3 x 5. 7 posts used in previous three-cable end terminals. This finding would suggest improved performance with respect to vehicle override and instability. However, vehicle simulations with multiple line posts impacted were inconclusive. Further design modifications, evaluation, and testing are recommended...|$|R

Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing <b>brackets,</b> <b>anchor</b> link <b>brackets,</b> bolster spring suspension brackets, alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames. It involves 40 meters (app.) of welding in a single conventional bogie frame. Based on load carrying capacity per axle, the conventional bogie frames are grouped into two types. They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of air-powder polishing systems in 1977, air-powder polishing {{has been shown to}} be an efficient and effective method for removal of stain and plaque. Air-powder polishing systems use air, water, and sodium bicarbonate to deliver a controlled stream that propels specially processed sodium bicarbonate particles to the tooth surface. It has been demonstrated that this increasingly popular technique requires less time and less physical exertion by the operator than polishing with a rubber cup and prophylaxis paste. In addition, no heat is generated with this type of system. Studies of the air-powder polishing method have examined its efficacy in stain removal and its effects on soft tissue, hard tissue, and restorative materials. William et al. found that air-powder polishing treatment imparted a nonuniformly roughened surface to enamel. Atkinson et al. and Toevs, however, found root surfaces to be smooth after treatment with the airpowder polishing system. Furthermore, this system has been shown to produce some immediate soft tissue trauma. In all of these studies this gingival trauma {{has been shown to be}} transient and clinically insignificant. Although air-powder polishing systems have been shown to be effective, it has been demonstrated that these systems have the potential for removing considerable amounts of resinous restorative material. On the other hand, porcelain, amalgam, and gold alloy restorations generally are not significantly affected. However, Barnes and associates did note an erosion of cement from the margin of cast-alloy restorations. The purpose of this two-part study, based on studies to date that have shown deleterious effects on resinous materials and cement, was to examine the efficacy and effects of an air-powder polishing system on orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth. Orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth certainly provide a greater challenge for routine cleaning that may be met by an air-powder polishing system. Specifically, this study investigated the time required for removal of stain and plaque from orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth as well as the efficacy of the air-powder polishing system. In addition, the effects of airpowder polishing on composite and zinc phosphate cements used to <b>anchor</b> orthodontic <b>brackets</b> and bands were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
40|$|PhDThis thesis evaluates {{standard}} setting initiatives in {{corporate social responsibility}} or `CSR' engagements. Chapter 1 establishes how {{standard setting}} initiatives are developed through narratives of CSR. In chapter 2, the thesis unpacks hard and soft CSR which {{is seen as the}} key step to unlock the possibilities of standard setting. By showing that there is a nexus between hard and soft CSR, the regulatory divide is bridged. From here, CSR is seen to consist of internal and external narratives. When the narratives merge, standard setting can evolve in a coherent and meaningful way. In developing internal narratives, chapters 3 and 4 evaluate the normative-theoretical underpinnings of the corporation and examine how it can sustain the notion of the socially responsible corporation. The corporation is bounded by institutional roots, political limitations and legal parameters. The theoretical make up of the corporation, informed by historical insight, shows that the corporation is a real institution, capable of absorbing values from the community within which it operates and provides something back as a community member. External narratives are then discussed in chapters 5 and 6 {{in order to create a}} framework for the CSR actors to work together. Standards tend to be <b>anchored</b> within various <b>brackets,</b> including state borders and beyond, between public and private notions of authority as well as positive and negative aspects of responsibility. The rule of law holds the key towards providing legitimacy to these standards. Ultimately, chapter 7 looks at convergence in standards through the rigours of good decision making. A call for procedural integration is made through an administrative base which will be able to draw out a common language between the actors. Calibrating the internal and external narratives reveals the evolving nature of standards which attempt to reimagine the corporation as an institution of responsibility...|$|R
