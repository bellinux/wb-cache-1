40|$|The {{problems}} of high fiscal deficit, high current account deficit, and high inflation {{faced by the}} government of Pakistan are linked to Pakistan's weak tax revenue effort. There are concerns that revenue in Pakistan is raised in an inefficient way by favoring certain sectors and economic activities over others. The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>expenditures</b> is often complicated because reporting and accounting practices fall far short of what is used for official government expenditures, which makes it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate the cost, efficiency and distributional impact <b>of</b> tax <b>expenditures.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> the study is to undertake a detailed <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>expenditure</b> in Pakistan, including an appropriate definition and methodologies for measuring tax expenditures.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to use data from the 2007 Agricultural Resource Management Survey to assess the {{inequality}} in the distribution of farm family living expenditures. The impact on inequality of marginal increases in expenditure components with respect to aggregate expenditures is also addressed in the context of the life cycle and under various “equity” weights that reflect the extent to which society is averse to inequality. Design/methodology/approach – Inequality in the distribution of households' equivalent-scale total expenditures E and of their K components is measured using the concept of the extended Gini coefficient (GE). Findings – Results show an unequal distribution of total expenditures, with “food including food away from home” and “clothing, personal care products, etc. ” as the two expenditure items that are most suitable for either a subsidy or a tax-hike. No discernable statistical difference is found when the elasticities of expenditures were estimated across two distinct age-groups and across various levels of “equity” weights. Research limitations/implications – Research is based on cross-sectional data and does not allow for dynamic <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> elasticities. Originality/value – The paper describes the use of an innovative non-parametric method to estimate expenditure elasticities among farm households.

40|$|The use of {{expenditure}} needs, {{sometimes referred}} to as "expenditure norms", "budgetary norms", or "minimum standards", is important in the formulation of budgets and, especially, in the establishment of transfer and grant formulae. Minimum standards are also used by central governments to control expenditure policies of subnational governments, often with the goal of protecting and enhancing national priorities. However, despite the continued wide use of expenditure norms, there are many aspects there are not fully understood. Perhaps the most basic issue is the actual construction of the norms. In this paper we examine what some countries have been doing to bring a more accurate assessment of their expenditure needs. We argue that the broad trend across most all countries is for budget controls and procedures to become less complex, and this tendency is observed throughout the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> needs process, including the design of grant formulae. Indeed, perhaps the major trend is to use simpler methods of expenditure needs where rules are clear for every component of the process and for all participants in the process. The consensus also appears to be that traditional budget processes should place a greater emphasis on the outcomes achieved by government spending units and the evaluation of managers and personnel according to these outcomes rather than controlling ex ante expenditure control, and that expenditure needs assessment can help in this process. budget, expenditures, fiscal management...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – While {{the extant}} {{literature}} {{is replete with}} theoretical and empirical studies of value at risk (VaR) methods, only a few papers have applied the concept of VaR to quantify market risk {{in the context of}} agricultural finance. Furthermore, papers that have done so have largely relied on parametric methods to recover estimates of the VaR. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess extreme market risk on investment in three actively traded agricultural commodity futures. Design/methodology/approach – A nonparametric Kernel method was implemented which accommodates fat tails and asymmetry of the portfolio return density as well as serial correlation of the data, to estimate market risk for investments in three actively traded agricultural futures contracts: corn, soybeans, and wheat. As a futures contract is a zero-sum game, the VaR for both short and long sides of the market was computed. Findings – It was found that wheat futures are riskier than either corn or soybeans futures over both periods considered in the study (2000 - 2008 and 2006 - 2008) and that all three commodities have experienced a sharp increase in market risk over the 2006 - 2008 period, with VaR estimates 10 - 43 percent higher than the long-run estimates. Research limitations/implications – Research is based on cross-sectional data and does not allow for dynamic <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> elasticities. Originality/value – This paper differs methodologically from previous applications of VaR in agricultural finance in that a nonparametric Kernel estimator was implemented which is exempt of misspecification risk, in the context of risk management of investment in agricultural futures contracts. The application is particularly relevant to grain elevator businesses which purchase grain from farmers on a forward contract basis and then turn to the futures markets to insure against falling prices.

40|$|Objective: the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> in {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a subject that has started to be investigated in the past 3 decades. This review will focus on studies that have assessed the energy <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> CKD predialysis and dialysis patients. Till date, most studies on this subject {{have focused on the}} <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> resting energy <b>expenditure</b> (REE). in this regard, the current published data have demonstrated that clinically stable nondialysed CKD patients have REE similar or slightly lower than that of age-and gender-matched healthy individuals. for dialyzed patients, in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the results are indicative that the REE of these patients {{is similar to that of}} age-and gender-matched healthy controls. the investigation of REE in specific catabolic conditions, such as poorly controlled diabetes, hyperparathyroidism, and inflammation, has shown that the REE in these catabolic conditions is increased. Additionally, it has also been reported that the hemodialysis procedure per se is also capable of enhancing the energy expenditure. the energy expenditure for physical activity is also an important component <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> and has been scarcely investigated {{in patients}} with CKD. the few studies that have investigated energy expenditure for physical activity have shown values lower than that of healthy sedentary individuals.

Partial correlations between <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> activity energy <b>expenditure</b> (kcal · min(- 1)) did not differ significantly by age (13 - 14 years: r = 0. 41; 15 - 16 years: r = 0. 42) or weight status (normal weight: r = 0. 42; overweight: r = 0. 39).

There has also been a clear trend in these lifestyle disorders with the development of urbanization and consequently; adoption of Westernized lifestyles associated with decline in physical activity due primarily to mechanization/automation of occupational and leisure time activities. Furthermore, there is also developing interest in the concept of sedentary behaviour.

Therefore, we developed an energy expenditure prediction model for beta-blocker-medicated cardiac rehabilitation patients. Methods Sixteen male cardiac rehabilitation patients (age: 55. 87. 3 years, weight: 93. 111. 8 kg) underwent a physical activity protocol with 11 low- to moderate-intensity common daily life activities. Energy expenditure was assessed using a portable indirect calorimeter. HR and body movement data were recorded during the protocol using unobtrusive wearable devices. In addition, patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test and resting metabolic rate assessment. Energy expenditure estimation models were developed using multivariate regression analyses based on HR and body movement data and/or patient characteristics. In addition, a HR-flex model was developed. Results The model combining HR and body movement data and patient characteristics showed the highest correlation and lowest error (r(2) = 0. 84, root mean squared error = 0. 834 kcal/minute) with total energy expenditure. The method based on individual calibration data (HR-flex) showed lower accuracy (i(2) = 0. 83, root mean squared error= 0. 992 kcal/minute). Conclusions Our results show that combining HR and body movement data improves the accuracy <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> prediction models in cardiac patients, similar to methods {{that have been developed}} for healthy subjects. The proposed methodology does not require individual calibration and is based on the data that are available in clinical practic...|$|R
