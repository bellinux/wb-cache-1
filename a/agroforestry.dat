5|$|The {{university}} has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology {{due to its}} pioneering efforts in plant breeding and bioengineering, particularly {{in the development of}} high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding in 1977. Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree. UPLB hosts a number of local and international research centers, including the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, World <b>Agroforestry</b> Centre, and the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture (SEARCA).|$|E
5|$|The Global Crop Diversity Trust is an {{independent}} international organisation which exists to ensure the conservation and availability of crop diversity for food security worldwide. It was established through a partnership between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) acting through Bioversity International. The CGIAR is a consortium of International Agriculture Research Centers (IARC) and others that each conduct research on and preserve germplasm from a particular crop or animal species. The CGIAR holds one of the world's largest off site collections of plant genetic resources in trust for the world community. It contains over 500,000 accessions of more than 3,000 crop, forage, and <b>agroforestry</b> species. The collection includes farmers' varieties and improved varieties and, in substantial measure, the wild species from which those varieties were created. National germplasm storage centers include the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation, India's National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources, the Taiwan Livestock Research Institute, and the proposed Australian Network of Plant Genetic Resource Centers.|$|E
25|$|Cocoa beans may be {{cultivated}} under shaded conditions, e.g. <b>agroforestry.</b> <b>Agroforestry</b> {{can reduce}} the pressure on existing protected forests for resources, such as firewood, and conserve biodiversity. Agroforests act as buffers to formally protected forests and biodiversity island refuges in an open, human-dominated landscape. Research of their shade-grown coffee counterparts has shown that greater canopy cover in plots is significantly associated to greater mammal species richness and abundance. The amount of diversity in tree species is fairly comparable between shade-grown cocoa plots and primary forests. Farmers can grow a variety of fruit-bearing shade trees to supplement their income to help cope with the volatile cocoa prices. Though cocoa has been adapted to grow under a dense rainforest canopy, <b>agroforestry</b> does not significantly further enhance cocoa productivity.|$|E
25|$|The Amazon Ecological Research Center (founded by Ikeda in 1992) outside Manaus, Brazil has pioneered reforestation, the {{creation}} of a regional seed bank and experiments in <b>agroforestry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moringa trees {{can also}} be {{cultivated}} in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between Moringa rows in an <b>agroforestry</b> cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 meters.|$|E
25|$|Forestry {{programs}} {{help communities}} conserve natural resources through {{projects such as}} soil conservation, flood control, creation of sustainable fuels, <b>agroforestry</b> (e.g., fruit and vegetable production), alley cropping, and protection of biodiversity.|$|E
25|$|In {{subtropical}} and arid environments, {{the timing}} and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as <b>agroforestry.</b> In temperate environments, where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie, highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} {{of higher education}} institutions are in Managua. Nicaragua's higher education system consists of 48 universities, and 113 colleges and technical institutes {{in the areas of}} electronics, computer systems and sciences, <b>agroforestry,</b> construction and trade-related services. In 2005, almost 400,000 (7%) of Nicaraguans held a university degree. Nicaragua also has several more specialized institutions, with a focus on education that will promote economic development.|$|E
25|$|Tecomella undulata is {{one more}} tree species, locally known as Rohida, which is found in Thar Desert regions of {{northwest}} and western India. It is another important medium-sized tree of great use in <b>Agroforestry,</b> that produces quality timber and is {{the main source of}} timber amongst the indigenous tree species of desert regions. The trade name of the tree species is Desert teak or Marwar teak.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{gardening}} can {{be viewed}} as a way to recreate the Garden of Eden. Forest gardening is a vegan organic food production and <b>agroforestry</b> system based on woodland ecosystems, incorporating fruit and nut trees, shrubs, herbs, vines and perennial vegetables. Robert Hart adapted forest gardening for temperate zones during the early 1960s with the intention of providing a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother Lacon.|$|E
25|$|Forestry has an {{important}} part {{to play in the}} amelioration of the conditions in semi-arid and arid lands. If properly planned, forestry can make {{an important}} contribution to the general welfare of the people living in desert areas. The living standard {{of the people in the}} desert is low. They can not afford other fuels like gas, kerosene etc. Fire wood is their main fuel, of the total consumption of wood about 75 percent is firewood. The forest cover in desert is low. Rajasthan has a forest area of 31150km2. which is about 9% of the geographical area. The forest area is mainly in southern districts of Rajasthan like Udaipur and Chittorgarh. The minimum forest area is in Churu district only 80km2. Thus the forest is insufficient to fulfill the needs of firewood and grazing in desert districts. This diverts the much needed cattledung from the field to the hearth. This in turn results into the decrease in agricultural production. <b>Agroforestry</b> model is best suited to the people of desert. Some Institutes have done good work in <b>Agroforestry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Much {{wood fuel}} comes from native forests around the world. Plantation wood is rarely used for firewood, {{as it is}} more {{valuable}} as timber or wood pulp, however, some wood fuel is gathered from trees planted amongst crops, also known as <b>agroforestry.</b> The collection or harvesting of this wood can have serious environmental implications for the collection area. The concerns are often specific to the particular area, but can include all the problems that regular logging create. The heavy removal of wood from forests can cause habitat destruction and soil erosion.|$|E
25|$|Managua is the {{national}} education center, {{with most of the}} nation's prestigious universities and higher education institutions based there. In 2007, after a successful literacy campaign, Managua was declared by the Mayor of Managua and the Sandinista party newspaper to be the first capital city in Central America to be rid of illiteracy. Nicaragua's higher education system consists of 48 universities and 113 colleges, vocational and technical institutes which serve students in the areas of electronics, computer systems and sciences, <b>agroforestry,</b> construction and trade-related services. The educational system includes 1 United States accredited English language university, 3 bilingual university programs, 5 bilingual secondary schools and dozens of English Language Institutes. In 2005, almost 400,000 (7%) of Nicaraguans held a university degree. 18% of Nicaragua's total budget is invested in primary, secondary and higher education. University level institutions account for 6% of 18%.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} {{practical}} applications of ecology in conservation biology, wetland management, natural resource management (agroecology, agriculture, forestry, <b>agroforestry,</b> fisheries), city planning (urban ecology), community health, economics, basic and applied science, and human social interaction (human ecology). For example, the Circles of Sustainability approach treats ecology {{as more than}} the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and resources compose ecosystems which, in turn, maintain biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes [...] acting on living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce natural capital like [...] biomass production (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of climate, global biogeochemical cycles, water filtration, soil formation, erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.|$|E
500|$|The Great Southern Group relied {{significantly}} {{on financial}} planners and accountants recommending their MIS products to investors. The company was paying commissions of ten percent – high by industry standards, and {{similar to those}} paid by other failed investment businesses including Westpoint Corporation and Storm Financial. It was also {{spending a lot of}} money on recruiting financial advisers to sell its products. One report indicated that A$137 million was spent on [...] "commissions, marketing and promotion in two years to 2008". Some accountants, with Great Southern's support, were recommending the agribusiness investment schemes, though they did not have a financial services licence; one report suggested over half of Great Southern's MIS sales were coming through accountants, often tax specialists from small practices. These practices had been questioned for several years by the corporate regulator ASIC and some market analysts, and were widely criticised following Great Southern's collapse. Some experts were critical of the lack of knowledge and expertise of the investment advisers recommending <b>agroforestry</b> MIS schemes.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Agroforestry</b> {{provides}} {{many examples}} of reconciliation ecology at work. In tropical <b>agroforestry</b> systems, crops such as coffee or fruit trees are cultivated under a canopy of shade trees, providing habitat for tropical forest species outside of protected areas. For example, shade-grown coffee plantations typically have lower tree diversity than unmanaged forests, however they have much higher tree species diversity and richness than other agricultural methods. Agriculture that mimics nature, encourages natural forest species along with the crops, and also takes pressure off nearby uncultivated forest areas where people are allowed to collect forest products. [...] The understory can also be managed with reconciliation ecology: allowing weeds to grow among crops (minimizing labor and preventing the invasion of noxious weed species) and leaving fallowlands alongside farmed areas can enhance understory plant richness with associated benefits for native insects and birds compared to other agricultural practices.|$|E

2500|$|The word {{agriculture}} is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager, [...] "field", and cultūra, [...] "cultivation" [...] or [...] "growing". Agriculture usually refers to human activities, {{although it is}} also observed in certain species of ant, termite and ambrosia beetle. To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to [...] "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services." [...] This definition includes arable farming or agronomy, and horticulture, all terms for the growing of plants, animal husbandry and forestry. A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged {{that there is a}} large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between silviculture (the management of forests) and agriculture. In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term <b>agroforestry.</b>|$|E
