5|$|I {{am willing}} to hold that, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> a statute like § 93(b), which prohibits a union from {{collecting}} dues from its members, impairs the union's ability to represent those members {{to such an extent}} that it infringes on their § 7 right to bargain through the representative of their choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{court also}} found the {{affidavit}} of Parker to be insufficient as a factual matter {{to comply with the}} terms of the statute.

5|$|Contact with {{ammunition}} is {{a source}} of lead exposure. As of 2013, lead-based ammunition production is the second largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012, second only to the manufacture of storage batteries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can not regulate cartridges and shells, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> Lead birdshot is banned in some areas, but this is primarily {{for the benefit of the}} birds and their predators, rather than humans.

5000|$|Nixon {{publicly}} criticized Bayh and Senate opponents for overstepping {{their proper}} constitutional role, to which Bayh replied in a Senate floor speech by quoting from Article Two of the United States Constitution and calling the President [...] "wrong <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> constitutional law, wrong <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> history and wrong <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> public policy."

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> the Governor-General {{is not in}} {{the same}} {{constitutional}} position as the Sovereign; the office itself does not independently possess any powers of the Royal Prerogative.

25|$|Opas {{decided to}} appeal against the murder verdict. The appeal {{was to the}} Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal, a bench {{consisting}} of three judges of the Supreme Court.

They also challenged the district court's claim construction, inequitable conduct, and attorney fees determinations.

25|$|Roman law {{recognized}} rape as a {{crime in}} which the victim bore no guilt and a capital crime. The rape of a woman was considered an attack on her family and father's honour, and rape victims were shamed for allowing the bad name in her father's honour. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. The rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.|$|E
25|$|To have standing, plaintiffs {{must prove}} that the {{surviving}} tribal organization is the successor in interest to the historical tribe. Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp. (1979) {{is an example of}} a claim defeated by disproving this element. The First Circuit has also held that the cause of action under the Nonintercourse Act accrues only to tribes, not individuals; moreover, where a jury finds against tribal status, non-federally-recognized tribes are not entitled to reverse that holding <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Static Control Components, Inc. v. Lexmark Int’l, Inc., 615 F.Supp.2d 575 (E.D.

The court said that the Supreme Court’s Quanta decision “has changed the landscape of the doctrine of patent exhaustion generally, and specifically” required a reversal of the judgment, so that SCCI was not liable to Lexmark for patent infringement.|$|E
25|$|John Connolly did not appear. His {{brother and}} Russell {{were found guilty}} on all five counts. Both raised the {{entrapment}} defense, arguing that while they would have made and sold meth regardless of Shapiro's involvement, his supplying of an ingredient that, while legal, was difficult to get due to the bureau's own efforts to dissuade chemical companies from selling it and requiring that those who did sell only to buyers with a valid manufacturer's license, constituted entrapment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some courts, {{violations}} of the stay are treated as void ab initio <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> although the court may annul the stay {{to give effect to}} otherwise void acts. Other courts treat violations as voidable (not necessarily void ab initio). Any violation of the stay may give rise to damages being assessed against the violating party. Non-willful {{violations of}} the stay are often excused without penalty, but willful violators are liable for punitive damages and may also be found to be in contempt of court.|$|E

25|$|In September, Proposition 8 proponents filed {{a motion}} for summary judgment. Running more than 100 pages, the motion {{asked the court to}} rule that Proposition 8 did not offend the U.S. Constitution without the need to find facts at a trial. The motion {{asserted}} that Baker v. Nelson foreclosed any further review by the court. Failing that, the motion argued that all of the couples' claims failed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> After a two-hour hearing on October 13, Walker denied the motion. He noted that the Supreme Court doctrine on sexual orientation and gender discrimination had changed since 1972. Resolving the amendment's validity, Walker noted, required hearing testimony at trial.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} half of {{the country}} had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom as British New Guinea. With the Papua Act 1905, the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed Commonwealth of Australia, which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed as the Territory of Papua. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth; <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country's post-independence legal system.|$|E
25|$|The {{court can}} impose a {{condition}} that a defendant not consume alcohol. Courts can prohibit use of other legally-obtained intoxicants as well. But the condition must be reasonably related to the crime for which the defendant pleaded guilty. The court can order outpatient drug abuse treatment and alcohol testing even if the defendant has no history of drug or alcohol abuse, if the defendant has attempted suicide by overdosing on medication and {{has a history of}} unstable behavior. The court may waive the statutory drug testing requirement if the presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse, but in some circuits is not required to do so although at least one defendant was not required to under mandatory drug testing as part of his probation where the offense was not drug-related and the defendant did not have a history of drug abuse. Nearly 680,000 federal offender urine samples were tested for drugs in 1992.
