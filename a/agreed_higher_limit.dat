50|$|In <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games, players {{tend to be}} tighter, and it is {{more common}} for {{everyone}} to fold to the blinds. In this case, chopping would occur so frequently {{that it would be}} pointless. Furthermore, <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games {{are much more likely to}} be short-handed. Finally, the rake in <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games is usually much smaller in comparison to the size of the pot, and if a collection is taken instead of a rake, this removes the economic reason for chopping. For all these reasons, chopping is much more common in lower limit games than in <b>higher</b> <b>limit</b> games.|$|R

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats have a <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> temperature {{and a low}} limit. If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the <b>high</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>high</b> <b>limit</b> exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the low limit, ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The low limit is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|R

All possible decoupling schemes have been interpreted in order to determine finite temperature expressions for the one phonon Green's function (and self energy) to 0 ()) for a crystal in which every atom is on a site of inversion symmetry. In order to provide a check of these results, the Helmholtz free energy expressions derived from the self energy expressions, have been shown to <b>agree</b> in the <b>high</b> temperature <b>limit</b> with the results obtained from the diagrammatic method.

40|$|We {{study the}} higher derived functors of the inverse limit of a functor F: D [...] > Z_{(p) }-mod, where D {{is one of}} the {{standard}} categories which arise when studying the homotopy theory of the classifying space of a finite group G, e. g., the orbit category or the Quillen category of G. These <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> are of importance e. g., for the study of maps between classifying spaces as well as for group cohomology. We show that these <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> can be identified with the G-equivariant Bredon cohomology of the subgroup complex of p-subgroups in G (i. e., the nerve of the poset of p-subgroups in G) with values in a G-local coefficient system. We examine when smaller complexes can be used e. g., taking only p-radical subgroups, p-centric subgroups, elementary abelian p-subgroups or various subcollections thereof. Since the subgroup complexes are finite complexes, and often rather small, this provides concrete, computable formulas for these <b>higher</b> <b>limits,</b> generalizing earlier work of especially Jackowski-McClure-Oliver. As an application we look at the special case where all the <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> vanish, as for example is the case for group cohomology. If F is a functor on the orbit category our formulas for the <b>higher</b> <b>limits</b> in this case yield five different expressions of F(G) in terms of values of F on proper subgroups. Two of these are `classical' namely Webb's exact sequence of Mackey functors and a formula for calculating stable elements, previously obtained using Alperin's fusion theorem. Examining this case also leads to improvements of sharpness results of homology decompositions due to Dwyer and others...|$|R
