While in England on business for a Hamburg shipping firm, he learned Braham had survived the war and was still alive. He persuaded the German consul in Bath to forward a letter to him. Correspondence followed from 1956 {{but it was only}} in 1961 that the circumstances permitted a meeting. Spreckels had learned English sufficiently to allow for two to communicate. Braham wrote in Scramble, [...] "Robert Spreckels became, in spite of world tension and hatreds, one who is counted <b>among</b> <b>my</b> company of friends." ...|$|E

I have never resumed it and never expect to do so." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that “fifty million listeners heard the unprecedented speech.” ...|$|E

500|$|Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a {{fundamental}} {{weakness in the}} film: the [...] "overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because {{there are times when}} Licence to Kills narrative bogs down." [...] Berardinelli gave the film three out of a possible four stars, adding [...] "Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping, but it's not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public's rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture." [...] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: [...] "It boggles my mind that Licence to Kill is so controversial. There's really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies." [...] John Glen has said Licence to Kill [...] "is <b>among</b> <b>my</b> best Bond films, if not the best".|$|E
500|$|I'm writing {{short stories}} right now, that's what I do between novels, and I love them. I'm very devoted to it. You know, it's funny. There {{seems to be}} some sort of law that you only get to be celebrated for one or the other. And then a couple of people will break it. Updike did. They didn't review his story {{collections}} by saying, [...] "Well, these are nice, but he's a novelist." [...] Or review his novels by saying, [...] "Well, too bad he can't do the longer stuff." [...] Other people tend to get patronized on one end or the other—and I'll take it. I have a very happy life as a novelist. But the story collections I've published are tremendously important to me. And many of the uncollected stories—or yet-to-be-collected stories—are <b>among</b> <b>my</b> proudest writings. They're very closely allied, obviously, to novel writing. But also very distinct, and, you know, there's no need to choose.|$|E
500|$|A devout Catholic, and {{politically}} social democratic, Logiest decided {{early on to}} favour the Hutu in his decision making in the country. This was partly for security reasons, as Logiest claimed that the Hutu would continue the violence {{as long as the}} Tutsi remained in power, but he also strongly in favour of the revolution on democratic grounds; he saw it as the opportunity for the [...] "oppressed" [...] Hutu peasants to rise up against the Tutsi ruling class. He later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "Some <b>among</b> <b>my</b> assistants thought that I was wrong in being so partial against the Tutsi and that I was leading Rwanda on a road towards democratisation whose end was distant and uncertain"; but he defended his actions, saying [...] "it was probably the desire to put down the morgue and expose the duplicity of a basically oppressive and unjust aristocracy". After Kigeli and UNAR's retaliation against the Hutu, Logiest and his troops prioritised the protection of Hutu leaders (including Gitera).|$|E

500|$|Ten {{years after}} {{finishing}} his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed {{lecture on the}} work, entitled [...] "", which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research. Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about Beowulf is [...] "widely recognized as {{a turning point in}} Beowulfian criticism", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements. At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated Beowulf for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of Beowulf was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem. Where Beowulf does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements. In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf: [...] "Beowulf is <b>among</b> <b>my</b> most valued sources", and this influence may be seen throughout his Middle-earth legendarium.|$|E
500|$|Reception of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics has been generally positive. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club praised the episode, gave a A- and commented that it is [...] "good to see The Simpsons try an ambitious episode, and great to see those ambitions largely fulfilled." [...] He added that episodes that [...] "give Bart extra depth ('Bart Sells His Soul' especially) are <b>among</b> <b>my</b> favorite Simpsons half-hours," [...] and noted that this episode features [...] "a side of Bart that we rarely see: someone living outside the moment. Imagining himself on his deathbed and thinking of how his whole life outside of the cruise was wasted {{is the sort of}} device typically reserved for the Simpson women, particularly Lisa." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that in the episode there [...] "are elements that will be familiar – it's another episode where a Simpson family vacation verges on disaster – but the main emotional storyline involving Bart is one The Simpsons hasn't touched on before, as a fantastic luxury cruise makes him uneasy {{about the state of the}} rest of his life." [...] Sepinwall concluded that he is [...] "always a fan of single-story Simpsons episodes, as well as ones built around an emotional issue facing a member of the family, and this has both – in addition to being funny and sweet and clever in its depiction of the Best Cruise Ever." ...|$|E

He focused on his opposition to abortion and gun control, as well as his support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and {{addressed the}} issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain.

2500|$|Matthews {{became a}} symbol of the repentant former Communist who {{rendered}} expert service to the U.S. Government in its crackdown against what it perceived to be a network of underground subversion. In his column of October 6, 1947, syndicated columnist George Sokolsky wrote: [...] I have <b>among</b> <b>my</b> friends and acquaintances literally dozens {{of men and women who}} during the Hitler-Stalin Alliance were so ashamed of Soviet cynicism that from ardent Communists they became ardent anti-Communists. Such a man was Dr. J.B. Matthews, while never a Communist, was associated with that party as a fellow traveler ... In fighting Communists, our Government is absolutely dependent upon the ex-Communists ... If the government is seriously trying to tackle the Communist menace, then the first step is to employ qualified experts.... Amateurs can bring only discredit upon the government. Every effort should be made to ensure the cooperation and protection of friendly witnesses....|$|E
2500|$|In 1893 the {{upheaval}} of the Fasci turned into strikes which were violently repressed in January 1894, after Francesco Crispi {{had taken over}} government from Giovanni Giolitti.

My place is there <b>among</b> <b>my</b> people. I do not fear the force of arms. … Of course Crispi will imprison me, but it will not help him. My arrest will only react against the Government," [...] he declared. He was arrested after attending a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee on January 4, 1894. Although he initially wanted to resist the arrest, he was persuaded not to do so as resistance to arrest would have been punishable by death under the state of siege. His arrest was described in The New York Times as a [...] "wise act", as De Felice's personal influence alone could have brought Catania to the verge of rebellion.|$|E
