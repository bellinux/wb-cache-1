Underpinned by the premise that GAAP can be generalised across the public/private divide, we examine whether systematic differences exist between <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> <b>adopted</b> by reporting entities with different ownership and/or operating objectives. We find evidence of sector preference in the choice of useful life for comparable depreciable assets, and differences in policies for the amortisation of goodwill. We also find evidence of sector convergence in the choice of methods for accounting for valuation of non-current assets, deferred taxation and inventory. It is observed that the two accounting policies indicating sector preference have a more direct impact on the Statement of Financial Performance than the other policies examined...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{accounting}} for goodwill has caused considerable concern to accountants and academics. For over 100 years {{there has been}} diversity of views as to the nature, recognition and measurement of goodwill. Such diversity of views has contributed to the adoption of a variety of accounting practices for goodwill, which has lead to attempts to regulate practice by accounting professions in the Anglo-American world. The research conducted involves a literature review to identify the concepts and definition of goodwill and the criteria for its recognition and measurement. the investigation will then concentrate upon goodwill arising on consolidation of the financial statements of a group of companies. Major accounting practices will be examined, along with the requirements of the australian and mojor overseas professions on the issue.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The UN Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety {{adopted in}} Montreal, 29 January, 2000 and opened for {{signature}} in Nairobi, 15 – 26 May, 2000 will exert {{a profound effect}} on international trade in genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their products. In this paper, the potential effects of various articles of the Protocol on international trade in GMOs are analyzed. Based on the present status of imports of GMOs and domestic research and development of biotechnology in China, likely trends in imports of foreign GM food and related products after China accedes to WTO is explored. Also, China’s potential countermeasures to control and regulate imports of GMOs in line with implementation of the Protocol are discussed. China, in recent times, has increased its food and agricultural imports substantially from USA and Canada. China imported soybean 10. 42 mill. tons in 2000 and about 15 mill tons in 2001, of which majority are from USA where GM soybean accounts for 60 %. The plantation of US Monsanto’s transgenic Bt cotton was increased to more than 1 million ha in China in 2001. Though China has paid great attention to develop biotechnology, it appears to have little scope to export GMOs and GM products. So China may consider a range of administrative measures to implement the Cartagena Protocol and to regulate its import of GMOs and GM agricultural products. Consequently, the Regulation on Safety of Agri-GMOs was issued on June, 2001 and followed three detailed rules issued in Jan. of 2002, with a priority to limit foreign GMOs importing by safety certification and labeling system. These were outlined taking into <b>account</b> <b>policies</b> <b>adopted</b> in Western countries such as green barriers to international trade...|$|R
40|$|Gross capital inflows and {{outflows}} to {{and from}} emerging market economies (EMEs) have witnessed a significant increase since early 2000 s. This rapid increase in the volume of flows accompanied by sharp swings in volatility has amplified the complexity of macroeconomic management in EMEs. While capital inflows provide additional financing for productive investment and offer avenues for risk diversification, unbridled flows could also exacerbate financial instability. In this paper {{we focus on the}} evolution of capital flows in a few select emerging Asian economies, and analyze surge and stop episodes as well as changes in the composition of flows across these episodes. We also provide a comprehensive description of the capital <b>account</b> management <b>policies</b> <b>adopted</b> by the host countries and evaluate the efficacy of these measures by analyzing whether they achieved the desired goals. This kind of an analysis is highly relevant especially a time when EMEs around the world are about to face the repercussions of a potential Quantitative Easing (QE) tapering by the US or launch of fresh QE measures by the Euro-zone, either of which could once again heighten the volatility of cross-border capital flows thereby posing renewed macroeconomic challenges for major EMEs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether, {{in the presentation}} of financial information, digital formats address the concern over users’ functional fixation. The accounting literature indicates that the presentation of financial information either within the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements often creates functional fixation where users of financial statements fail to adjust for differences in <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> This leads users to judge what would otherwise be identical financial situations as being different due to the different <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> and methods <b>adopted.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} the use of digital formats in presenting financial reports may overcome functional fixation. Using an experimental design involving accountants in public practice, the results indicate that the use of digital formats to present financial reports does not fully overcome the issue of functional fixation in the processing of financial information. Although the participants were able to identify and extract relevant information, irrespective {{of whether or not the}} information was presented within the financial statements or in the notes to the accounts, the evidence indicates that functional fixation remained when the participants made final decisions based on available information. This suggests that functional fixation may not be caused by access to or extraction of information but by the level of perceived significance based on where the information is reported in the financial statements. In general, the results indicate that current technology may not be able to fully reduce functional fixation in the evaluation of financial information prepared in accordance with different <b>accounting</b> <b>policies</b> and methods...|$|R
40|$|Large and {{volatile}} capital flows pose serious challenges for macroeconomic management in developing countries. Our main objective {{in the first}} chapter is to assess both the role of capital controls in helping to prevent financial instability, and there adequacy {{for the management of}} financial stress. We consider theoretical approaches that introduce distortions to capital markets, moral hazards, information asymmetries, bounded rationality and endogenous financial instability, making a strong case for the use of capital <b>account</b> management <b>policies.</b> Furthermore, we analyse whether dollarisation could help to deliver financial stability and therefore constitute an alternative to capital controls. In the second chapter, we examine the price-based capital <b>account</b> management <b>policies</b> <b>adopted</b> in the 1990 s by Chile, Colombia and Brazil. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of those regulations, concentrating on their impact on net capital flows, on the maturity structure of flows and on the real exchange rate. In the case of Chile, according to our analysis and evidence capital controls succeeded in reducing net short-term flows; however, they did not affect long-term flows or the real exchange rate. As far as Colombia is concerned, the regulations seem to have been more effective, as they were capable of reducing not only short-term flows but also long-term ones, as well as affecting the real exchange rate. In turn, in the case of Brazil, taxes on inflows were only directed at portfolio inflows and the evidence shows that they succeeded in having a significant impact on them. Finally, in the third chapter, we analyse whether price-based controls on capital inflows were successful in insulating these economies against external shocks. Our results indicate that capital controls did help to shield Chile and Colombia against external disturbances in the 1990 s. We conclude that the experiences of Chile, Colombia and Brazil present strong evidence that capital account regulations help to provide greater policy autonomy.

40|$|Policy {{makers have}} long been {{concerned}} that adjustments to retained earnings might give rise to unwarranted differences across income numbers of adjusting and nonadjusting firms. Researchers of financial markets, meanwhile, have generated a body of evidence showing that markets set security prices using an information set broader than, and superior to, accounting measurements of net income. This evidence suggests that markets are capable of pricing securities efficiently even if adjustments to retained earnings {{have given rise to}} unwarranted differences across income numbers. ^ This dissertation compared cumulative market returns observed in the two years after adjustments to retained earnings with contemporary changes in net income that were not attributable to economy and industry effects. Independent comparisons were performed with 1, 026 observations associated with seven types of adjustments. On the assumption that markets do price securities efficiently, the comparisons may provide a basis for judging, normatively, the appropriateness of post-adjustment income numbers. ^ These comparisons provided evidence of (1) full compatibility following adjustments for compensated absences and for SFAS No. 52 foreign currency translation, (2) partial compatibility following adjustments for oil and gas exploration and events of prior period, and (3) incompatibility following adjustments for lease commitments, poolings of interests, and SFAS No. 8 foreign currency translation. ^ The results of these comparisons appeared to support three major conclusions: First, the security returns generated by efficient financial markets may be useful as a basis for evaluating the relevance of alternative measurements of net income. Second, compatibility between market returns and income numbers probably cannot be achieved until <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> makers <b>adopt</b> the concept of 2 ̆ 2 comprehensive income. 2 ̆ 2 Third, the poolings of interests method of accounting for certain business combinations may create a conflict between interests of managers and shareholders, and that conflict may be sufficiently serious as to justify the method 2 ̆ 7 s termination. ...|$|R

Capital account controls have been introduced in several countries and have even been supported by the International Monetary Fund. In this paper we investigate whether capital <b>account</b> <b>policies</b> in the post-Bretton Woods era can be explained as a process driven by learning by policymakers, who update their beliefs {{on the basis of their}} own experience and of the <b>policies</b> <b>adopted</b> by other countries. We emphasize the impact of financial crises on the learning process. The learning model developed in the paper explains more than 90 % of the variability of capital <b>account</b> <b>policies.</b> We find that over time beliefs about the growth effects have changed slowly and not smoothly from negative to positive. However, at the outset of the Great Recession beliefs on the positive growth dividends from capital account liberalization were still affected by a significant degree of uncertainty, which suggests that reversals in external liberalizations in the aftermath of the Great Recession are consistent with rational learning by policymakers. Finally, in evaluating the potential benefits and costs of capital controls in a given set of countries, contagion effects through changing beliefs of other countries should be taken into account...|$|R
