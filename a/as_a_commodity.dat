5|$|The Nazi regime {{promoted}} a liberal {{code of conduct}} regarding sexual matters and was sympathetic to women who bore children out of wedlock. Promiscuity increased as the war progressed, with unmarried soldiers often intimately involved with several women simultaneously. The same {{was the case for}} married women, who liaised with soldiers, civilians or slave labourers. For example, sex was sometimes used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> to obtain better work from a foreign labourer. Pamphlets enjoined German women to avoid sexual relations with foreign workers as a danger to their blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic externalities they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E

Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of acres for bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887.

In the following centuries, planters cultivated wine grapes, cochineal for making dyes, and plantains for use and export.|$|E
25|$|Some socialists, view {{total and}} {{immediate}} wage dependence {{as a form}} of slavery. The labour market, as institutionalised under today's market economic systems, has been criticised, especially by both mainstream socialists and anarcho-syndicalists, who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative or dysphemism for wage labour. Socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> and slavery. Cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.|$|E
25|$|Amate {{paper has}} a long history. This history is {{not only because the}} raw {{materials}} for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a use value, {{and if it}} is traded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E
25|$|St. George {{was founded}} as a cotton mission in 1861 under the {{direction}} of Apostle Erastus Snow. It was called Dixie by Brigham Young, who was president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While early settlers cultivated cotton <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> crop, they did not succeed in producing it at competitive market rates; consequently, cotton farming was eventually abandoned. More important to the economy was tourism, which developed as the railroads began to carry visitors to the nearby Zion National Park.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{importation}} of slaves from Africa was being restricted or eliminated, the United States was undergoing a rapid expansion of cotton, sugar cane and rice production in the Deep South and the West. Invention of the cotton gin enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton, which could be produced more widely than other types; this led to King Cotton throughout the Deep South. Slaves were treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> by owners and traders alike, and were regarded as the crucial labor for the production of lucrative cash crops that fed the triangle trade.|$|E
25|$|Much of upland Georgia was {{developed}} as {{what became known}} as the Black Belt, named for the fertile soil. Planters brought or purchased many enslaved African Americans as workers for the labor-intensive crop. The leading Cherokee participated in the cultivation of cotton <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> crop, which soon replaced deer-skin trading as a source of wealth in the region. The first steamboat navigated the Coosa River to Rome in 1836, reducing the time-to-market for the cotton trade and speeding travel between Rome and New Orleans on the Gulf Coast, the major port for export of cotton.|$|E

The first European settlements were made in 1634, when the English arrived in significant numbers and created a permanent colony. Maryland was notable for having been established with religious freedom for Roman Catholics. Like other colonies of the Chesapeake Bay, its economy was based on tobacco <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>commodity</b> crop, cultivated primarily by African slave labor, although many young people came from Britain as indentured servants in the early years.|$|E
