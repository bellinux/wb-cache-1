5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria has {{a typical}} civil law legal system. The {{judiciary}} is {{overseen by the}} Ministry of Justice. The Supreme Administrative Court <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court of Cassation are the highest courts of appeal and oversee the application of laws in subordinate courts. The Supreme Judicial Council manages the system and appoints judges. Bulgaria's judiciary, along with other institutions, remains one of Europe's most corrupt and inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E

5|$|Chinese-American cook Wong Kim Ark, who {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1873, had been denied {{re-entry}} to the United States after a trip abroad, under a law restricting Chinese immigration and prohibiting immigrants from China (the Great Qing) from becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of Congress.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, {{attempts}} {{to suppress the}} statements given by J. D. B. {{because he was not}} given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J. D. B. was not in police custody.

5|$|From March 1781, the Congress of the Confederation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were {{situated}} at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia.

5|$|The main {{national}} courts are the Constitutional Court, which oversees {{violations of the}} Constitution, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court, which is the highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also County, Municipal, Misdemeanor, Commercial, and Administrative courts. Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are {{in the first instance}} decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges. Lay magistrates also participate in trials. State's Attorney Office is the judicial body constituted of public prosecutors that is empowered to instigate prosecution of perpetrators of offences.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by taking control of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
