5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E

25|$|The first Championship game in June {{saw them}} {{come back to}} edge a win against Nottinghamshire by 14 runs, and they carried their good one-day form into the match with Lancashire which they won by 79 runs. They then lost heavily to England in a fifty-over game that {{provided}} the national side with practice prior to the NatWest Series with Bangladesh and Australia. Their title hopes were dented, however, as they went down by an innings to Surrey, and the Hawks took their rage out on <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> Glamorgan side that were defeated by seven wickets.|$|E

25|$|Several {{days after}} the trial verdict, a letter was {{delivered}} to the Indonesian embassy in Canberra containing an unknown substance on 31 May 2005. It was later found to be non-toxic and was considered a hoax. The embassy was shut down for decontamination. With negotiations on a prisoner exchange agreement between Australia and Indonesia about to begin, the Australian Government condemned the actions saying if they {{were related to the}} Corby case they would not help. The Indonesian foreign ministry described the attack as <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> and cowardly attempt at intimidating Indonesia, and said Indonesia would not succumb to such a threat.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh's {{reply was}} <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> one. Yet again, {{they failed to}} play the short ball well enough, and lost five wickets – Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff the main culprits, taking two each – for a miserable 65 before Khaled Mashud and Aftab Ahmed took some {{responsibility}} and guided them to stumps with 95 for 5. It was not to last, though. Only six balls into the third day, Hoggard bowled a good off-cutter to Aftab Ahmed, who failed to play it properly and was hit on the pads – out for a fine 32, Bangladesh's highest score in the Test series so far.|$|E
25|$|Ten-pin bowling was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1960. This was driven by the opening of the Stamford Hill and Golders Green bowling alleys in London. Ten-pin bowling took the UK by storm, with alleys opening up one after the other. At its peak, there were over 160 bowling alleys in the UK, but a lack of re-investment and waning interest left the fad in <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> state. This led to a general deterioration of bowling alleys, with a commensurate decline in their image. In the 1970s a major chain operator, Top Rank, pulled out of bowling and converted many of the more luxurious alleys into Bingo halls. The industry nearly collapsed, with two thirds of the existing alleys closing over the next few years.|$|E

25|$|Middlesex' reply {{would have}} been <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> one but for a big {{partnership}} between Owais Shah (83) and Irish left-hander Ed Joyce (70), who continued his great form in the Championship, passing 400 runs in his third match of the season. The pair {{were the only ones}} who passed 35, but their fourth-wicket partnership of 166 was the highest in the match. However, leg spinner Shane Warne got the better of both of them in the end, as Joyce gave a return catch and Shah was stumped off the bowling of the Australian. With Hampshire losing two quick wickets to be 28 for 2 at the close, the match hung in the balance, with nightwatchman Billy Taylor on 0 and Australian batsman Simon Katich on 1.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
25|$|Nasir al-Dawla {{had reason}} to be {{confident}} that he could defeat Mu'izz al-Dawla if he made an attempt to capture Baghdad. His army had been bolstered {{by the arrival of}} numerous Turkish soldiers who had fled from Baghdad just before Mu'izz al-Dawla's entrance into the capital, and he was much more familiar with the territory between Mosul and Baghdad than his rival was. Mu'izz al-Dawla, on the other hand, was on less secure ground; Baghdad was in <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> state thanks to years of mismanagement and he was hamstrung by its numerous financial and military problems. Nasir al-Dawla furthermore gained a pretext for war when in January 946 Mu'izz al-Dawla deposed and blinded the caliph al-Mustakfi and replaced him with the more obedient al-Muti'. As a result of these factors, Nasir al-Dawla took a belligerent tone with the Buyids; he withheld the payment of tribute to Baghdad, refused to recognize al-Muti' as caliph and continued to mint coins in al-Mustakfi's name.|$|E

25|$|Ulster: The Ulaid proper were in <b>a</b> <b>sorry</b> state {{all during}} this era, being {{squeezed}} between the emergent Ó Neill of Tír Eógain in the west, the MacDonnells, Clann Aodha Buidhe, and the Anglo-Normans from the east. Only Mag Aonghusa managed {{to retain a}} portion of their former kingdom with expansion into Iveagh. The two great success stories of this era were Ó Domhnaill of Tír Chonaill and Ó Neill of Tír Eógain. Ó Domhnaill was able to dominate much of northern Connacht to the detriment of its native lords, both Old English and Gaelic, though it took time to suborn the likes of Ó Conchobhair Sligigh and Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne. Expansion southwards brought the hegemony of Tír Eógain, and by extension Ó Neill influence, well into the border lordships of Louth and Meath. Mag Uidir of Fear Manach would slightly later be able to build his lordship up to that of third most powerful in the province, {{at the expense of the}} Ó Raghallaigh of Iar Breifne and the MacMahons of Airgíalla.|$|E

500|$|Pollock was {{especially}} scornful {{of those who}} viewed the Arab street as irrelevant because it was unknowable.

For one thing, it should be self-evident that you cannot dismiss the Arab street just because you don't understand it." [...] As for the [...] "exaggerated" [...] school, he first observed that there was, in fact, little history of real popular revolutions deposing governments in the modern Middle East with {{what he called the}} [...] "debatable" [...] exception of the 1958 Lebanon crisis, and not even many more unsuccessful attempts to do so via street uprisings.

On 1May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that [...] "Mrs E.M.

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule {{tied the}} appearance of the obverse to neoclassicism, noting the resemblance of Gobrecht's Liberty to the marble statues of ancient Rome. [...] The neoclassical school was popular {{in the first half of}} the 19th century, and not only among official artists; Vermeule noted, [...] "it becomes almost painfully evident that similar sources were consulted both by the engravers of United States coins in Philadelphia and by the cutters of tombstones from Maine to Illinois". [...] The reverse retained the shield upon the eagle's breast. [...] Art historian Vermeule described it as [...] "the same old unnatural, unartistic eagle with shield on his stomach, like a baseball umpire's protector... to clutch branch and olives in one foot, arrows of war in the other oversized set of claws". [...] According to numismatic historian David Lange, the Reich-Gobrecht reverse design is known among some coin collectors as the [...] "sandwich-board eagle". [...] Breen, in his comprehensive volume on US coins, complains of [...] "the 'improvements' inflicted by [...] on a hapless Ms. Liberty.

[...] In 1883, The Times, reviewing a matinee performance of Iolanthe, wrote: [...] "Mr. Grossmith's impersonation of the Lord Chancellor has ... become an exquisitely refined satire." [...] On the other hand, his sketch comedy background had trained Grossmith to improvise comic business. [...] Gilbert and the actor had a famous exchange during rehearsals for The Mikado about an improvised bit of [...] "business" [...] in which Jessie Bond pushed Grossmith, as they kneeled before the Mikado, and he rolled completely over.
