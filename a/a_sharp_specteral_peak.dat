40|$|AbstractExampleThere {{exists a}} space X with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> base and <b>a</b> perfect mapping f:X→Y onto a space Y {{which does not}} have <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> base. It is known that a spaces with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> base have <b>a</b> point-countable <b>sharp</b> base. This can be {{sharpened}} to “point-finite” {{on the set of}} isolated points. TheoremIf X has <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> base then X has <b>a</b> point-countable <b>sharp</b> base which is point-finite on the set Z of isolated points. (Hence Z is an Fσ set.) A topological proof of the previous theorem is given but the theorem follows from a more general combinatorial statement about certain subsets of κ×κ.

40|$|Within the {{traditional}} Hilbert space formalism of quantum mechanics, {{it is not}} possible to describe a particle as possessing, simultaneously, <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> position value and <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> momentum value. Is it possible, though, to describe a particle as possessing just <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> position value (or just <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> momentum value) ? Some, such as Paul Teller, have thought that the answer to this question is No [...] that the status of individual continuous quantities is very different in quantum mechanics than in classical mechanics. On the contrary, I shall show that the same subtle issues arise with respect to continuous quantities in classical and quantum mechanics; and that it is, after all, possible to describe a particle as possessing <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> position value without altering the standard formalism of quantum mechanics...|$|R
