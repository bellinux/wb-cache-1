25|$|The {{supplement}} of {{an interior}} angle is called an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle,</b> that is, an interior <b>angle</b> and an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> form a linear pair of angles. There are two <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> at each vertex of the polygon, each determined by extending {{one of the}} two sides of the polygon that meet at the vertex; these two angles are vertical angles and hence are equal. An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> measures the amount of rotation one has to make at a vertex to trace out the polygon. If the corresponding interior angle is a reflex <b>angle,</b> the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> should be considered negative. Even in a non-simple polygon it may be possible to define the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle,</b> but one will have to pick an orientation of the plane (or surface) to decide the sign of the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> measure.|$|R

50|$|Angles between {{adjacent}} {{sides of}} a triangle {{are referred to as}} interior angles in Euclidean and other geometries. <b>Exterior</b> <b>angles</b> can be also defined, and the Euclidean triangle postulate can be formulated as the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem.

5000|$|The {{measure of}} the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> at a vertex is {{unaffected}} by which side is extended: the two <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> that can be formed at a vertex by extending alternately {{one side or the}} other are vertical angles and thus are equal.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Exterior</b> <b>angle</b> – The <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> is the {{supplementary}} {{angle to}} the interior angle. Tracing around a convex n-gon, the angle [...] "turned" [...] at a corner is the <b>exterior</b> or external <b>angle.</b> Tracing {{all the way around}} the polygon makes one full turn, so the sum of the <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> must be 360°. This argument can be generalized to concave simple polygons, if external angles that turn in the opposite direction are subtracted from the total turned. Tracing around an n-gon in general, the sum of the <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> (the total amount one rotates at the vertices) can be any integer multiple d of 360°, e.g. 720° for a pentagram and 0° for an angular [...] "eight" [...] or antiparallelogram, where d is the density or starriness of the polygon. See also orbit (dynamics).|$|R
5000|$|In several {{high school}} {{treatments}} of geometry, the term [...] "exterior angle theorem" [...] {{has been applied}} to a different result, namely the portion of Proposition 1.32 which states that the measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the remote interior angles.

25|$|The {{sum of the}} {{measures}} of the interior angles of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. This allows determination of {{the measure of the}} third angle of any triangle given the measure of two <b>angles.</b> An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is equal to the sum of {{the measures}} of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it; this is the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem.

50|$|In the plane, angles about a point {{add up to}} 360°, while {{interior}} angles in a triangle add up to 180° (equivalently, <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> add up to 360°).

50|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem is Proposition 1.16 in Euclid's Elements, {{which states}} that the measure of an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a {{triangle}} is greater than either of the measures of the remote interior angles.

It is also likely that students who have had a strong experiential background in LOGO (Turtle Geometry) would find this approach quite natural and easy (see Activity 1 in De Villiers, 2011). For example, consider the star pentagon shown below. Imagine that one is a turtle (like in turtle geometry) starting from A, then walking along the perimeter from A to B, turning through the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> b, then from B to C, turning through <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> c, etc. When one returns to A, turning through the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> a, one again faces in the same direction one started off from.

Since {{the interior and}} <b>exterior</b> <b>angles</b> sum to 180 degrees, the angle CPD is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a right angle.

50|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem is not valid in spherical {{geometry}} nor in {{the related}} elliptical geometry. Consider a spherical triangle one of whose vertices is the North Pole {{and the other two}} lie on the equator. The sides of the triangle emanating from the North Pole (great circles of the sphere) both meet the equator at right angles, so this triangle has an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> that is equal to a remote interior angle. The other interior angle (at the North Pole) can be made larger than 90°, further emphasizing the failure of this statement. However, since the Euclid's <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem is a theorem in absolute geometry it is automatically valid in hyperbolic geometry.|$|R

5000|$|A {{triangle}} {{has three}} corners, called vertices. The {{sides of a}} triangle (line segments) that come together at a vertex form two angles (four angles if you consider {{the sides of the}} triangle to be lines instead of line segments). Only one of these angles contains the third side of the triangle in its interior, and this angle is called an interior angle of the triangle. In the picture below, the angles ∠ABC, ∠BCA and ∠CAB are the three interior angles of the triangle. An <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> is formed by extending one of the sides of the triangle; the angle between the extended side and the other side is the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle.</b> In the picture, angle ∠ACD is an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|R

50|$|Euclid's Proposition 27 {{states that}} if a {{transversal}} intersects two lines so that alternate interior angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel. Euclid proves this by contradiction: If the lines are not parallel then they must intersect and a triangle is formed. Then one of the <b>alternate</b> <b>angles</b> is an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> equal to the other angle which is an opposite interior angle in the triangle. This contradicts Proposition 16 which states that an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is always greater than the opposite interior angles.|$|R

One can also prove in absolute geometry the <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> theorem (an <b>exterior</b> <b>angle</b> of a triangle is larger than either of the remote angles), as well as the Saccheri-Legendre theorem, which states that the sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle has at most 180°.|$|R
