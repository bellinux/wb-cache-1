25|$|According to the Homeric Hymn III to Delian Apollo, Hera {{detained}} Eileithyia to already prevent Leto {{from going}} into labor with Artemis and Apollo, since {{the father was}} Zeus. The other goddesses present at the birthing on Delos sent Iris to bring her. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> upon the island, the divine birth began. In {{the myth of the}} birth of Heracles, it is Hera herself who sits at the door instead, delaying the birth of Heracles until her protégé, Eurystheus, had been born first.|$|E
500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>stepped</b> on the train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E

50|$|The {{screenplay}} showcased playwright Harold Pinter's trademark style, {{depicting the}} menace and angst bubbling {{just beneath the}} surface of commonplace remarks and seemingly innocent or banal situations.
