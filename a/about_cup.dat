40|$|Introduction Despite {{being the}} 6 th {{cause of cancer death}} in Australia, cancer of unknown primary (CUP) site remains poorly understood. Aims To {{describe}} practices {{relating to the}} diagnosis, investigation, classification, communication and management of CUP amongst medical oncologists. Methods We invited all members of the Medical Oncology Group of Australia to participate in a national, anonymous online survey <b>about</b> <b>CUP.</b> The survey collected data regarding diagnosis acceptance, diagnostic tests, treatment protocols and communication practices around the diagnosis of CUP. Results 302 oncologists were invited and 86 (28 %) completed the survey. Eighty respondents (93 %) were directly involved in the assessment of patients with CUP. Eighty-five (99 %) respondents were prepared to make a diagnosis of CUP if, after appropriate diagnostic tests, the primary location could not be ascertained. 83 % would assign a primary site to obtain Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS) funding of medical therapy. 62 % did not have a specific treatment protocol designed for CUP. The majority of oncologists used serum tumour markers and CT scans in the initial work-up, whilst 43 % indicated they would use a PET scan in the majority of cases. The majority would arrange mammography in female patients. Thematic analysis of responses to open-ended questions about how CUP is described identified little consistency in the language being used. Conclusion The approach to diagnosis, investigation and management of CUP by medical oncologists in Australia is variable. Many preferred to estimate the primary site and treat accordingly. PBS restrictions may encourage the practice of &# 039;best guessing&# 039;...|$|E

O estudo desenvolvido foi {{transversal}} de correlação. Foram realizadas coletas nos prontuários das mães e do bebê, executada uma observação das mães ofertando a dieta no copinho e aplicado um questionário com perguntas sobre o uso do copo. A análise dos resultados foi realizada por meio do programa software estatístico, SPSS 13. 0. Aplicou-se testes de estatística descritiva, mais especificamente a distribuição das freqüências e das percentagens relativas de cada dado observado. Em relação à associação entre as variáveis estudadas foram utilizados os seguintes testes: teste Qui-Quadrado, com nível de significância de 5 % (p PURPOSE: {{to evaluate}} cup feeding manipulation by mothers of low weight preterm infants' and {{to analyze the}} aspects that interfere in the correct use of this technique. METHODS: a cross-section correlation study was conducted. The sample included 30 pairs of mothers and babies. Data collection was based on patient' charts; interviews with the newborn' mothers and observing a diet offered in a cup feeding by mothers. The analysis of the results {{was based on the}} Software Statistical Package Social Sciences (SPSS) 13. 0. We used descriptive statistical techniques through the distribution of the frequencies and the relatives percentages of each observed data. The Chi-square test and the Sperman Correlation Coeficient were used to analyze association between the variables (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: there is a significant relation between the babies' posture, the cup feeding, the volume given and the health professional guidance <b>about</b> <b>cup</b> feeding. CONCLUSION: mothers can manipulate the cup feeding, however, they need healthy professional guidance on this technique (cup feeding) and the milk's volume; mainly in relation to the care with the position of the glass and the volume of milk...|$|E
40|$|Background: Preterm birth has {{significantly}} {{increased in the}} last two decades. Preterm infants lack synchrony and coordination in sucking, swallowing, and breathing necessary for oral feeding. Cup feeding has been identified as a safe alternative for preterm infants who are not able to fully breastfeed, yet the practice is limited. One potential reason this alternative is underutilized is lack of health care provider knowledge regarding cup feeding. Understanding health care provider knowledge will provide information to guide cup feeding education efforts. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship between health care team knowledge and the use of cup feeding in neonatal intensive care units. Methods: A non-experimental cross-cultural correlational design will be used to evaluate study goals. A convenience sample of ~ 350 neonatal nurses and physicians from US and Jordan will be recruited to complete a web-based survey. Recruitment strategies will include Email, website links, and snowballing. To evaluate health care provider knowledge <b>about</b> <b>cup</b> feeding a questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire includes items asking about demographic data (e. g. Age, ethnicity, occupation, and experience). A 7 -point Likert scale ranging from Always to never was used to assess knowledge regarding feeding type (bottle, breast, NGT, and cup). Multivariate Regression analysis will be conducted to examine the relation between health care provider knowledge and cup feeding practices. Regressions will control for potential covariates (e. g., provider age, culture, experience, and education). Findings and Conclusions: Research still in process. Preliminary results will be available by May. Nurses and physicians have the authority to decide which feeding method to use for an infant. In addition, parents are influenced by health care provider advice. Identifying health care provider knowledge of cup feeding can identify misconceptions regarding cup feeding. These findings will lead to educational interventions aimed at improving feeding of preterm infants...|$|E

40|$|This thesis report {{describes}} {{the driving force}} behind my ceramic sculpture, a pursuit of form reflecting conscious and instinctive concepts in art. Each piece, a created situation removed somewhat from the context of the visual and expected, calls attention to the processes by which the human species functions. The environments created program a controlled ituation that evokes viewer response as they add to and heighten the illusions of real situations. The drama of these sculptural realities is further intensified by being life-sized. An intention of the work is not to function as the object it visually represents, but to explore an overall concept of function vs nonfunction. The relation to everyday objects establishes a visual connection that leaves the viewer questioning the aspects of function. The pitcher with a rounded bottom only stands when placed on a grid table which holds it in place, (photo 1, pg. 2) But is it functional? The lack of glaze inside precludes traditional use but suggests an idea of a pitcher. The drama lies in viewing the work and reviewing the ideas suggested about the functionality of everyday objects. With this in mind a connection surfaces between objects and the environments for which they were created. The images and assemblages created make restatements of traditional functional forms. These forms become statements of tables about tables, pitchers <b>about</b> pitchers, <b>cups</b> <b>about</b> <b>cups,</b> and containers <b>about</b> containers. Within these are secondary statements about each piece such as the spout, handle, bottom, top, exterior, and interior of a pitcher. Alone each item has individual meaning and when placed together relate to the overall environment...|$|R
