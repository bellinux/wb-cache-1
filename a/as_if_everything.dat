25|$|When Peggy awakes, {{she finds}} herself back {{in the spring of}} 1960, her senior year of high school, after she passed out after {{donating}} blood in the school gym (where the reunion was). She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before. After a rough first night, she decides to have fun with the experience and behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>everything</b> is normal. However, when given the chance to break up with Charlie, she thinks it might be best since she knows how it will end.|$|E
500|$|At the 32nd Japan Academy Prize {{ceremony}} held in February 2009, Departures {{dominated the}} competition.

In response to the wins, Motoki said [...] "It feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>everything</b> miraculously came together in balance this time with Okuribito".|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} since, {{praise for the}} work has been {{consistently}} high. It is considered a [...] "science-fiction classic ... is arguably the best novel written about nuclear apocalypse, surpassing more popularly known books like On the Beach". A Canticle for Leibowitz has also generated a significant body of literary criticism, including numerous literature journal articles, books and college courses. Acknowledging its serialization roots, literary critic David N. Samuelson writes that A Canticle for Leibowitz [...] "may be the one universally acknowledged literary masterpiece to emerge from magazine SF." [...] Fellow critic David Cowart places the novel {{in the realm of}} works by Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, in 1975 stating it [...] "stands for many readers as the best novel ever written in the genre". Percy, a National Book Award recipient, declared Canticle [...] "a mystery: it's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>everything</b> came together by some felicitous chance, then fell apart into normal negative entropy. I'm as mystified as ever and hold Canticle in even higher esteem." [...] Scholars and critics have explored the many themes encompassed in the novel, frequently focusing on its motifs of religion, recurrence, and church versus state.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} {{as to the}} merits of the novel's ending. Andy Smith lamented that the finale of the [...] "mostly intriguing" [...] novel was [...] "distinctly anticlimactic". Tim Martin wrote that it seemed [...] "somehow less {{than the sum of its}} parts". Clay Evans {{dismissed}} it as [...] "not especially meaningful, but fun", whereas Matt Thorne found it lacking [...] "a traditional thriller's excitement". San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Michael Berry called it [...] "an ingenious reversal" [...] which proved that despite its apparent cynicism, the novel was [...] "oddly optimistic for a ghost story". Overall, Thorne judged the novel ultimately unsatisfactory on account of the underwhelming ending and because Gibson [...] "hides the full complications of the plot so successfully that it feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>everything</b> important is happening offstage". Roger Perkins judged the novel to be [...] "a triumph of style over substance – which is exactly the way you suspect that Gibson wants it." [...] His colleague Martin mused that along with the regular Gibsonian tropes, there was [...] "something new ... a dark and very contemporary surge of suspicion and bad faith" [...] in the novel which suggested that the author might be approaching the apex of his writing. Dan Conover concluded that while the [...] "darkly comic satire" [...] was [...] "a worthy addition to the Gibson canon and a significant cultural artifact", it would not rank among the author's best works.|$|E

That is, the mind {{will withdraw from}} its external objects and gather into a single whole, letting go of all labels and attachments dealing with past or future. There will be just bare awareness paired with its preoccupation in the present. This is something with no sense of [...] "inside" [...] or [...] "outside" [...] — a condition whose features are peculiar to the mind itself. It is <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>everything</b> has undergone a revolution." ...|$|E
