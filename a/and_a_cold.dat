5|$|Subtropical Storm Nicole was {{the first}} {{subtropical}} storm to receive a name using the standard hurricane name list that did not become a tropical cyclone. The fourteenth tropical or subtropical storm of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Nicole developed on October 10 near Bermuda from the interaction of an upper level trough <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. The storm turned to the northeast, and after attempting to transition into a tropical cyclone, it dissipated as it was absorbed into a larger extratropical storm.|$|E

50|$|The {{most basic}} clock {{thermostats}} may only implement one program with two periods (<b>a</b> hotter period <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>colder</b> period), <b>and</b> {{the same program}} is run day after day. More sophisticated clock thermostats may allow four or more hot and cold periods to be set per day. Usually, only two distinct temperatures (<b>a</b> hotter temperature <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>colder</b> temperature) can be set, even if multiple periods are permitted. The hotter and colder temperatures are usually established simply by sliding two levers along an analogue temperature scale, {{much the same as}} in a conventional (non-clock) thermostat.|$|R

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Cristobal had minimal effect to any land masses. Its remnants brought unsettled conditions to Bermuda, including a 45mph (72km/h) wind gust at the Bermuda International Airport. The combination of moisture from Cristobal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front produced 2.78inches (71mm) in a 24‑hour period. The {{interaction between the}} remnants of Cristobal and a high pressure system over the Mid-Atlantic States produced rip currents and 4foot (1.2m) waves along the south shore of Long Island, New York; three people drowned from the rip currents. Two ships recorded tropical storm force winds {{in association with the}} storm; the vessel with the sign WUQL reported sustained winds of 47mph (76km/h) from the west-southwest on August 7.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor {{condition of the}} roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|Just a {{week after}} Hurricane Juan hit Nova Scotia, the Newfoundland and Labrador Emergency Measures Organization advised the general public to take {{appropriate}} actions for the anticipated effects of Hurricane Kate, including high winds and potentially up to 3in (80mm) of rain. Such actions include securing loose objects, cleaning debris from storm drains, and owning appropriate hurricane supplies (such as a charged cell phone and batteries {{in the event of}} power outages). A cruise ship scheduled to stop in St. John's bypassed Newfoundland to avoid the storm. The Newfoundland and Maritimes Weather Center issued a storm warning for Newfoundland, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued a hurricane-force wind warning. Due to the expected combination of moisture from Kate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front, the Canadian Hurricane Centre also issued a heavy rainfall warning for southeastern Newfoundland. Offshore, waves were expected to reach 33feet (10m), while marine wind warnings were issued as well.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{was related}} to a large low-pressure system across the central United States that intensified on February28 while over Kansas, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, a surge of very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm temperatures across {{the south side of}} the storm helped feed the storms. Temperatures were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was below freezing on the north side. The dewpoints were in the 60°F (16°C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Six {{developed}} offshore of the Southeastern United States on September 22 {{from the}} merger of a surface trough, a tropical wave, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front. The depression quickly intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Danielle six hours later. An approaching trough caused a northeastward movement, but later a high pressure system forced the storm to northwestward, which caused Danielle to execute a small anti-cyclonic loop on September23–24. While offshore of North Carolina on September 25, Danielle reached its peak intensity as a moderately strong tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h). It was initially predicted that Danielle would make landfall in North Carolina, however, the storm curved north-northwestward and made landfall in Maryland {{on the eastern shore}} of the Delmarva Peninsula at the same intensity. Danielle continued inland and weakened and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.|$|E
5|$|I./LG 1 {{abandoned}} Boscombe Down and bombed Southampton instead. No. 238 Squadron {{had been}} detailed to intercept, but the fighter escort was too strong and the bombers were not diverted from their course. Several warehouses were destroyed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> storage plant was also knocked out. All fires were under control by dusk. One III./LG 1 dropped its bombs by RAF Middle Wallop Sector Station by mistake. Only Andover airfield was hit, {{and it was}} used for bomber operations, not fighters. III./LG 1 lost two Ju 88s. The 13 Ju 88 Gruppen (Groups) had lost six destroyed and many damaged. They had escaped lightly. The bombing succeeded in destroying a bicycle factory, a furniture warehouse and a refrigerated meat depot. Luftwaffe intelligence had not identified the Southampton Spitfire factory—on the waterfront near the docks—as an important target. Poor intelligence suggested it was a bomber factory. Only later, in September, was it attacked and severely damaged. However, even then the Germans were unaware of the damage inflicted to Spitfire production. The factory would later be broken up and production dispersed.|$|E

25|$|The {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 led to odd weather patterns and temporary cooling in the United States, {{particularly in the}} Midwest {{and parts of the}} Northeast. An unusually mild winter was followed by an unusually cool, wet summer <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> early autumn in 1992. Enhanced rainfall occurred across the West Coast of the United States, particularly California, during the 1991–92 and 1992–93 rainy seasons, and the American Midwest experienced elevated levels of rainfall, and consequent major flooding, during {{the spring and summer of}} 1993.|$|E

25|$|In early September, the {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Lee had stalled due to Hurricane Katia. As a result, the main cyclone stalled over the Midwest, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front associated with Lee stalled over the Northeastern states. This drew tropical moisture into the Mid-Atlantic. Over 1 1/2 feet of rain fell in some areas from September 3 to 7. Moisture from Hurricane Irene had already saturated the ground little over a week before, leaving the runoff plunging straight into waterways. Streams and creeks throughout the region flooded, as well as moderate flooding of the Delaware River in some spots.|$|E
25|$|Drinking {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{a significant part of}} Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of national measures of per-capita alcohol consumption, consumption of alcohol per state, and proportion of drinkers. Consumption per-capita per-event, however, ranks low among the nation; number of events (number of times alcohol is involved) is significantly higher or highest, but consumption at each event smaller, marking Wisconsin's consumption as frequent and moderate. Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the longstanding presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the works}} of Friedrich A. Schott and Julian P. McCreary Jr., the Northeastward Somali current has the {{following}} two sub-season periods. During June–July, the Great Whirl grows at 4-10°N, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> wedge shape water mass develops to the offshore at latitude 10-12°N. The size and strength of the Great Whirl during the summer monsoon is measured as 10cm/s velocity at about 1000 m depth, while some visible gyre structure is observed at further depth. The upper layer Somali Current flows northwards along the East African coast, and finally enters the Gulf of Aden between the Socotra Archipelago and the Horn of Africa. The mean flow velocity of this outgoing current is about 5 Sv.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel is}} notable {{for the fact}} that Poirot never visits any of the crime scenes or speaks to any of the {{witnesses}} or suspects. He is challenged to prove his claim that a crime can be solved by the exercise of the intellect alone. The novel marks the return of partial first-person narrative, a technique that Christie had largely abandoned earlier in the Poirot sequence but which she had employed in the previous Ariadne Oliver novel, The Pale Horse (1961). There are two interwoven plots: the mystery Poirot works on from his armchair while the police work on the spot, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cold</b> War spy story told in the first person narrative.|$|E
25|$|Placing a {{conductive}} {{thick plate}} as a heat transfer interface between a heat source <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> flowing fluid (or any other heat sink) may improve the cooling performance. In such arrangement, the heat source is cooled under the thick plate {{instead of being}} cooled {{in direct contact with}} the cooling fluid. It is shown that the thick plate can significantly improve the heat transfer between the heat source and the cooling fluid by way of conducting the heat current in an optimal manner. The two most attractive advantages of this method are that no additional pumping power and no extra heat transfer surface area, that is quite different from fins (extended surfaces).|$|E
25|$|Israel has a {{distinctly}} Mediterranean climate, {{with the country}} located along roughly the same latitude as San Diego and the Mexico – United States border. There are two primary seasons - a hot, humid summer season running from April to October with very little precipitation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> rainy winter season from late October to March. During winter, average precipitation is around 20inches (50cm) with some areas seeing as much as 35inches (90cm) annually. Some vineyards in the higher elevation regions of Golan Heights can see snow in the winter months. With a dry growing season, drip irrigation is essential to sustaining viticulture. Vineyard managers will utilize pruning and canopy management techniques to maximize shade production from the sunlight. Harvest will often take place during the cooler temperatures of night time. The dryness of the growing seasons serves a protective barrier to many grape diseases that thrive in damp weather and allows vineyard managers to control vigor and yields with by irrigation.|$|E
