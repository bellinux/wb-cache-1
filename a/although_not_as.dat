5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs {{and other species}} that have successfully been kept in captivity, are occasionally kept as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also kept as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
5|$|Other pirate radio {{stations}} in Britain were connected with the indie scene, with the most notable being Q102 and Radio Phoenix in London, and KFM Radio in Manchester. Playing indie rock, these stations broke bands such as Blur and The Happy Mondays. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> numerous as either the black or rave oriented stations, they did {{have a significant impact}} on the music industry. The music journalist, Steve Lamacq broadcast on Q102, which later became XFM.|$|E

5|$|Seventy {{percent of}} the United States' electrometallurgical {{ferroalloy}} manufacturing employees are located in Ohio. The entire industry as a whole, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> concentrated as the electrometallurgical ferroalloy manufacturing sector, employs 34,000 paid workers at 234 individual workplaces. Ohio's 234 workplaces make up 9.5% of the United States industry's workplaces, and the 34,000 paid workers make up 13.6% of the United States industry's workers. Of these workers and workplaces, the sector of iron, steel, and ferroalloys make up the largest sector in Ohio's industry, with 17,000 paid workers in 73 workplaces.|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Hale {{was noted}} for his {{resistance}} to bribery and {{his willingness to}} make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law. He sat in Parliament, either in the Commons or the Upper House, in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament, and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II's reinstatement as monarch, sparking the English Restoration. Under Charles, Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In both positions, he was again noted for his integrity, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> a particularly innovative judge. Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676, dying ten months later on 25 December 1676.|$|E
5|$|Burges's two finest gothic {{churches were}} also {{undertaken}} in the 1870s, the Church of Christ the Consoler, Skelton-on-Ure, and St Mary's, Studley Royal. His patron, George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> rich as Bute, was his equal in romantic medievalism and had been a friend of Bute's at Oxford, which {{may account for the}} choice of Burges as architect. Both churches were built as memorial churches for Ripon's brother-in-law, Frederick Grantham Vyner, who was murdered by Greek bandits in 1870. Vyner's mother commissioned the Church of Christ the Consoler and his sister St Mary's. Both begun in 1870, Skelton was consecrated in 1876 and Studley Royal in 1878.|$|E

5|$|Jayawardene {{made his}} ODI debut against Zimbabwe on 24 January 1998, and scored his first century a year later, against England on 23 January 1999. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> illustrious as his Test centuries, {{he has since}} made 19 ODI centuries for Sri Lanka. This is the fourth-highest number of centuries for Sri Lanka by a single player behind Jayasuriya's 28, Sangakkara's 21, and Dilshan's 20. On 10 June 2007, Jayawardene scored 107 runs for the Asia XI team, which he captained during the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored an unbeaten 139 in the same match, and Jayawardene are the only players who have scored a century for Asia XI. Jayawardene became the sixth player to score a century at a Cricket World Cup Final with an unbeaten 103 against India during the final match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup. However, Sri Lanka lost the match, making Jayawardene the first centurion in a lost cause at a World Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Lord Thomas Bulkeley {{bought the}} castle from the Crown in 1807 for £735, {{incorporating}} {{it into the}} park that surrounded his local residence, Baron Hill. By then the castles of North Wales had become attractive locations for visiting painters and travellers, who considered the ivy-clad ruins romantic. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> popular as other sites in the region, Beaumaris formed part of this trend and was visited by the future Queen Victoria in 1832 for an Eisteddfod festival and it was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1835. Some of the castle's stones may have been reused in 1829 to build the nearby Beaumaris Gaol.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} two species of raven occurring in Australia: the little raven and forest raven. The Australian raven is also somewhat {{closely related to the}} Torresian and little crow, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> closely related as it is to the other raven species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.|$|E

5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about two miles away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
5|$|A few spider {{species that}} build webs live {{together}} in large colonies and show social behavior, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> complex as in social insects. Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae) can form colonies of up to 50,000 individuals. The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality: all known American species are social, and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social. Members of other species {{in the same family}} but several different genera have independently developed social behavior. For example, although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other social species, T. nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co-operate in prey capture and share food. Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species (family Uloboridae), Agelena consociata (family Agelenidae) and Mallos gregalis (family Dictynidae). Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ("thieves"), and larger colonies are more successful in this. The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings. Even widow spiders (genus Latrodectus), which are notoriously cannibalistic, have formed small colonies in captivity, sharing webs and feeding together.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{active in}} routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{fast as he}} {{had been}} on the {{previous}} tour, Constantine was still capable of short bursts of very fast bowling. However, the slowness of the pitch reduced the effectiveness of the Bodyline tactics, and Constantine took one for 55; England's captain Douglas Jardine, who had implemented the Bodyline tactics in Australia, batted for five hours to score his only Test century. The public disapproval expressed during and after the match was instrumental in turning English attitudes against Bodyline, something Constantine considered hypocritical. In the West Indies' second innings Constantine's innings of 64 in an hour ensured that the match was drawn. Nelson initially agreed to release him for the third Test, with Essex all-rounder Stan Nichols to be Constantine's substitute for the club team. When Jardine heard, he convinced the England selectors to include Nichols in the England team for the Test, the deal collapsed and Constantine did not play. Most critics believed that the West Indies underachieved in the Test series; Constantine believed that one cause was the inadequacy of Grant as captain. In all first-class games on the tour Constantine scored 181 runs at 20.11 and took 14 wickets at 22.14.|$|E
5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E

5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, <b>although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E
5|$|Night {{was welcomed}} by the German and Polish forces {{surrounding}} Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts {{to retreat from}} the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach {{the last of the}} Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing — approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, The Canadian Grenadier Guards managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. By late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine River. The Falaise Gap had been permanently closed, with a large number of German forces still trapped in the pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} by Bushnell and Dabney during 1970–71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar. After the pair were {{unable to find a}} way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created just to run that game. After they built an early proof of concept and founded Syzygy Engineering, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar. After encouraging initial results, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units with the anticipation of a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300–1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Syzygy before closing in 1976. Syzygy went on to be incorporated as Atari, with their next arcade game the successful Pong (1972). <b>Although</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> influential as Pong, Computer Spaces release marked the initial start of the commercial video game industry.|$|E
