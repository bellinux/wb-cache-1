With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were {{taking place in the}} market. The first problem was for startups to be able to <b>access</b> <b>capital</b> and to decrease {{the amount of time that}} it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.|$|E

An old generation with little concern for its country''s <b>access</b> to <b>capital</b> markets can force a default on debt if it has the majority of voters. On the other hand, if the younger generation is more numerous, it can force repayment of previously defaulted debt. Other voter heterogeneities, such as in income, can generate similar results.

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{financial}} reporting conservatism {{is related to}} firms’ financial flexibility and their <b>access</b> to <b>capital.</b> If conservatism facilitates monitoring and governance by capital providers, they should {{be more willing to}} extend financing and increase firms’ <b>access</b> to <b>capital.</b> However, because conservatism leads to systematic understatement of net worth and weakens the appearance of firms’ balance sheet strength, it could also reduce firms’ <b>access</b> to <b>capital.</b> This study tests these two opposing views of the relationship between conservatism and firms’ financial flexibility. Results indicate that firms with greater reporting conservatism exhibit less flexibility in their corporate liquidity management, in their debt or equity issuance decisions, in the sensitivity of their investments to financing constraints and in their payout policies. Overall, results suggest that although firms enjoy lower debt contracting costs by reporting conservatively, they forgo some flexibility in future <b>access</b> to <b>capital,</b> and this affects their financial decisions...|$|R

30|$|<b>Access</b> to <b>capitals</b> {{is central}} in {{understanding}} livelihoods while reflecting how policies and institutions affect <b>access</b> to <b>capitals</b> {{is also important}} (DFID 1999). In <b>access</b> to <b>capitals,</b> politics and power relations play a role. As such, ‘a livelihood is organized in arenas of conflicting [and] co-operating actors’ (De Haan and Zoomers [2005], p. 34). Yet, politics have been overlooked in livelihood studies (Scoones [2009]). Politics relate to how macro policies (e.g. neoliberal globalization in Mexico) and power relations among actors affect the <b>access</b> to <b>capitals.</b> In the Mexican rural context, different actors often collide and intertwine (Long [1998]). Drawing on these concepts, we postulate that goat husbandry is a livelihood strategy adapted historically to its specific context and that goat-keeping households employ a range of <b>capitals,</b> the <b>access</b> to which {{is influenced by the}} context. This refers to the institutional and political context in which goat husbandry is embedded, such as the agroecology and everyday relations of farmers among themselves and with other actors.|$|R

30|$|A {{number of}} {{hypotheses}} were supported whiles others were refuted. The finding supports {{the hypothesis that}} <b>access</b> to foreign <b>capital</b> by SMEs owners promotes new products innovation. SMEs that have <b>access</b> to foreign <b>capital</b> experienced greater sales income with respect to new products compared {{those who do not}} have <b>access</b> to foreign <b>capital.</b> The finding shows that a dollar increase in foreign capital to SMEs innovation results in about 15 % rise in sales income of innovation product. This finding corroborates with the study by Salomon and Shaver (2005), which indicate that SMEs in China that benefit from transfer of capital from foreign investors experience growth in innovation. They attributed the development to know-how and technologies foreign capital owners bring onboard. <b>Access</b> to foreign <b>capital</b> gives the enterprise owner some level of flexibility in their planning compared to those without foreign capital and inadequate self-funding. Opportunity to <b>access</b> foreign <b>capital</b> affords SME owners opportunity to engage in long-term planning, which includes new products innovation. This study therefore puts forward an argument that SMEs that have <b>access</b> to <b>capital</b> from external sources are more likely to innovate than those without.|$|R
