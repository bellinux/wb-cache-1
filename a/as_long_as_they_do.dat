5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result {{in the death of}} one of the males.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live twice <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, {{it was thought that}} lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Players can {{run with}} the ball in any {{direction}} they want. However they cannot use a teammate to obstruct the opposition.

25|$|Funding for {{maintaining}} {{and improving the}} {{water supply and sanitation}} infrastructure comes from the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Indirectly, substantial funding historically came from the European Union through its European Regional Development Fund. In addition, local authorities levy planning contributions mainly for small capital improvements. Group scheme members are entitled to a subsidy from their local authority. After the abolition of domestic water charges in 1997, it was intended that this scheme would extend those benefits to households supplied by group water schemes. The amount of subsidy is 100% of the qualifying expenditure, meaning that all running costs of the scheme are covered by the subsidy <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not exceed the subsidy limit.

25|$|Some {{countries}} and jurisdictions have explicit bans on sharia law. In Canada, for example, sharia law has been explicitly banned in Quebec by a 2005 unanimous vote of the National Assembly, while the province of Ontario allows family law disputes to be arbitrated only under Ontario law. In the U.S., opponents of Sharia have sought to ban it from being considered in courts, {{where it has been}} routinely used alongside traditional Jewish and Catholic laws to decide legal, business, and family disputes subject to contracts drafted with reference to such laws, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not violate secular law or the U.S. constitution. After failing to gather support for a federal law making observing Sharia a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison, anti-Sharia activists have focused on state legislatures. By 2014, bills aimed against use of Sharia have been introduced in 34 states and passed in 11. These bills have generally referred to banning foreign or religious law in order to thwart legal challenges.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{citizens}} can {{study in the}} United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need {{to apply for a}} visa <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand {{citizens can}} apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) reference number issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK. New Zealand citizens who have been issued with a Tier 4 student visa (but not those who are in the UK as student visitors) can work in the UK for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and without time restrictions outside term-time.|$|E
25|$|Highlander Scoring: The points awarded {{function}} slightly {{differently than}} in conventional Spades. Highlander Scoring merges partnership playing with individual team effort. Sandbagging {{does not apply}} {{with this type of}} game play, although sandbagging could be included. Each partner makes a bid of the tricks they think they can win. Each partner must win the total they individually bid; if not, that player's bid value is deducted from the team's score even if their partner took enough trick to make up the difference. :For example, if Tom bids 5 tricks and wins 4 tricks, and Harry (his partner) bids 3 tricks and wins 4 tricks, 80 points is deducted from the partnership's total score even though the team won their promised 8 tricks, because Tom did not make his bid. However, Harry is awarded five points per overtrick, so they are âˆ’75 points instead of âˆ’80 points. If the contract is broken and no overtricks were taken, the team is down the full amount of the bid. If both made their contract and have won overtricks, they are awarded five extra points per overtrick. Team that wins seven or more tricks per round is given 10 points the first time, 20 points the second, and each time thereafter the points increase by 10. This encourages race-style play where players set out to take as many tricks as they can <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not steal tricks their partner needs.|$|E

25|$|A {{computer}} then instructs {{the user}} {{to go to a}} certain teletext page which has been assigned to the customer for that session. Usually the page initially contains a menu with options and the user chooses among the options using the buttons on the telephone. When a choice has been made, the selected page is immediately broadcast and can be viewed by the user. This is in contrast with usual teletext where the customer has to wait for the selected page to be broadcast, because the pages are broadcast sequentially. This technology enables teletext to be used for games, chat, access to databases etc. It allows one to overcome the limitations on the number of available pages. On the other hand, {{only a limited number of}} users can use the service at the same time, since one page is allocated per user. Some channels solve this by taking into account where the user is geographically calling from and by broadcasting different teletext pages in different geographical regions. In that way, two different users can be assigned the same page number at the same time <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not receive the TV signals from the same source. Another drawback to the technology is the privacy concerns in that many users can see what a user is doing because the interactive pages are received by all viewers. Also, the user usually has to pay for the telephone call to the TV station. For these reasons, these services have since been superseded by the World Wide Web.|$|E

500|$|Treating motor {{symptoms}} with {{surgery was}} once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined. Studies {{in the past few}} decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the globus pallidus [...] or the subthalamic nucleus. [...] Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by Alim Louis Benabid and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have severe [...] problems. Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific [...] areas. For example, pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.|$|E
