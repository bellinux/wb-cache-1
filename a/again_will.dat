25|$|The show {{makes it}} clear that every Stargate {{originally}} had its own DHD, located {{directly in front of the}} gate and facing it. Over time, however, some DHDs have been damaged or lost. This has been the source of plot difficulties for the protagonists on several occasions, as it is still possible to travel to a Stargate that lacks a DHD, meaning that dialing home <b>again</b> <b>will</b> be much more difficult, if not impossible. One of the primary functions of the MALP that precedes an SG team is to confirm the presence of a DHD. In the absence of a DHD, a user must select the address by manually rotating the inner ring of the Stargate, and use an external power source, as the ring will not rotate unless it is energised. Pegasus Galaxy Stargates do not have a movable ring, so manually dialing these is impossible. Travelers can also emulate a DHD through a Dialing computer as present at Stargate Command. Remote dialers have been used by several races like the Goa'uld and Asgard in various episodes. As the Stargates in Stargate Universe are a different (less advanced model) the crew of the Destiny are forced to use such a device as no planet visited so far has any variation of DHD present.|$|E

500|$|Complaints from Uru: Ages Beyond Myst {{carried over}} to Myst Online; for example, Robert Washburne of JustAdventure {{found that the}} {{interface}} was still clunky. Charles Onyett of IGN said that those who had played through the previous Uru content would not find many changes: [...] "As a result, Myst veterans uninterested in plugging through Urus content <b>again</b> <b>will</b> be left with a dearth of things to actually do, shifting the onus of gameplay creation to the community." [...] Onyett continued {{that the only reason}} to subscribe to the game was the dedicated fan community and the potential for the game to expand. Sarah Borger of GamesRadar noted that most puzzles could be completed without the help of other players, making the game [...] "a pretty chat room".|$|E
500|$|According to Roberts, [...] "What Howe {{started in}} 1940 was an Industrial Revolution, so {{widespread}} that most Canadians {{were unaware of}} its extent or of its penetration into the country's economy." [...] Although there had been increases in production throughout {{the first three years}} of the war, the minister's efforts truly bore fruit in 1943, in which Canada had the fourth-highest industrial production among the Allies, trailing only the US, USSR, and Britain. By 1944, Canada had produced over 600ships for the war effort, 1,100aircraft, and over half a million cars and trucks, of which 31,000 were armoured. According to Roberts, Howe's actions swung Canada's economy from agriculture-based to industrial, a change which would prove permanent. [...] Howe stated in 1943, [...] "Never <b>again</b> <b>will</b> there be any doubt that Canada can manufacture anything that can be manufactured elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 14, 1946, Williams {{auditioned for}} Nashville's Grand Ole Opry but was rejected. After {{the failure of}} his audition, Williams and Audrey Sheppard tried to {{interest}} the recently formed music publishing firm Acuff-Rose Music. Williams and his wife approached Fred Rose, {{the president of the}} company, during one of his habitual ping-pong games at WSM radio studios. Audrey Williams asked Rose if her husband could sing a song for him on that moment, Rose agreed, and he liked Williams' musical style. Rose signed Williams to a six-song contract, and leveraged this deal to sign Williams with Sterling Records. On December 11, 1946, in his first recording session, he recorded [...] "Wealth Won't Save Your Soul", [...] "Calling You", [...] "Never <b>Again</b> (<b>Will</b> I Knock on Your Door)", and [...] "When God Comes and Gathers His Jewels". The recordings [...] "Never Again" [...] and [...] "Honky Tonkin'" [...] became successful, and earned Williams the attention of MGM Records.|$|E

500|$|MGM {{released}} [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] on February 11, 1949, coupling it with [...] "Never <b>Again</b> (<b>Will</b> I Knock On Your Door)". The single sold 50,000 {{copies in}} the first two weeks. On its February 26, 1949 review, Billboard opined: [...] "Hank's razz-mah-tazz approach and ear-catching yodeling should keep this side spinning". Based on votes sent to Billboard, the record was rated with 85 points by disc jockeys, 82 by record dealers and 85 by jukebox operators. Between the three, the track scored an overall of 84. In reference to its 100-point scale, Billboard regarded the record as [...] "Excellent". It reached number one on Billboard's Top C singles, where it remained for sixteen weeks and reached number twenty-four on Most Played in Jukeboxes. The magazine listed it as the [...] "number one country and western record of 1949" [...] while Cashbox named it [...] "Best Hillbilly record of the year". [...] In March 1949, Wesley Rose requested Williams to send him the records by Griffin and Miller to prove that the song was in the public domain. Irving Mills, the original lyricist, sued Acuff-Rose. The suit was settled on November 1, 1949 and it was agreed that Mills and Acuff-Rose would share the publishing of Williams' recording. Mills retained the rest of rights to the song as he had also purchased Friend's rights during the Great Depression.|$|E

So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant.

Dong Xi's subordinates evacuated the warship and boarded the smaller boats (走舸; zouges) and pleaded for him to join them. However, Dong Xi replied sternly, [...] "I've received orders to defend this position from the enemy. How can I abandon my post like this?
