5|$|Industrial {{decline from}} {{the turn of}} the 20th century, coupled with the {{building}} of Gateshead's first council estate, saw Carr Hill transformed from an industrial settlement into a residential suburb of the Gateshead Council ward of Deckham. Governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party, the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared to other areas of the borough and nationally, with high levels of unemployment and low levels of income. It is served by Carr Hill Primary School. There are two small parks that contribute to the social activity of the area, <b>as</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Elgin Centre at Elgin Road. Two historic venues, both now closed, face uncertain futures, <b>as</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> parish church.|$|E

5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm.

5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was aware of these activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, <b>as</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E

5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} <b>as</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

The 1906 hockey season ended with the Wanderers as the Stanley Cup champions.
