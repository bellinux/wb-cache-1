Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry), and siblings Sara (Jo Armeniox) and Bill (Eric Sheffer Stevens), <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that Nikki was suicidal, with evidence at the scene suggesting this, but when Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) do an autopsy, the evidence suggests otherwise.

5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica about the details of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they <b>all</b> <b>say</b> some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} axioms {{are about}} the use of topological means to distinguish disjoint sets and distinct points. It's not enough for elements of a topological space to be distinct (that is, unequal); we may want them to be topologically distinguishable. Similarly, it's not enough for subsets of a topological space to be disjoint; we may want them to be separated (in any of various ways). The separation axioms <b>all</b> <b>say,</b> in one way or another, that points or sets that are distinguishable or separated in some weak sense must also be distinguishable or separated in some stronger sense.|$|E

She identifies the name of the author of each book as an anagram of the name [...] "Sam Weiss", the bowling alley owner who she had directed Olivia to after her initial return from the parallel universe. She approaches Sam, who does not deny he wrote the books, and who explains that the doomsday device being constructed can either create or destroy a universe; how that will work will depend on Peter, who is biologically tuned to the device. Sam posits that Peter will most likely save the universe from which the Olivia he loves originates. The episode ends with Olivia reading the note from Simon, which states that Peter still has feelings for Fauxlivia.|$|E

[...] An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author: [...] "He knew he was different and that his music was good but I thought he was such a nasty character; always rude and quite vulgar." [...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word". Morrison's image appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone a year after releasing Moondance.|$|E

There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can <b>all</b> <b>say</b> we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E

It {{begins with the}} performance of [...] "Umbrella" [...] at the Manchester show when the scenes are intercut with Rihanna talking about how her fans are coming to watch her on the tour concerts. Other scenes of Rihanna and her crew members, dancers and band are also shown backstage. Rihanna then continues with the interview telling about how she went to some places that she never heard in her life including Ischgl and Sofia. She also explains how flying in private jet with her team like [...] "one family" [...] is fun, but very rare. Scenes of Rihanna performing a show in Ischgl and having snowball fight with hear team at the town's streets are shown. During the interview Rihanna explains that she, her crew members and dancers were touring for a considerable amount of time and became very close so as a result of that, they hang out a lot. One of the crew explains: [...] "It is like a family. Rihanna comes in every day, says hi to every single one of us. Each of us come in every day, we <b>all</b> <b>say</b> hi to each other." [...] Rihanna further describes herself as a prankster, and a story of her and one of the crew members pranking is shown. Scenes are intercut to Rihanna and her team performing a show.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Natalie, {{without a}} {{legitimate}} order, has recalled Kottwitz's regiment to obtain support for Homburg's pardon. In {{the face of}} the general pressure now put on him, the Elector now listens to his officers. Kottwitz is of the opinion that what counts on the [...] field of battle is victory, and that there is nothing with which to reproach the Prince. Hohenzollern goes further and attributes the guilt to the Elector, as he caused the Prince's confusion and consequent insubordination by the trick he played on him, and therefore bears the responsibility himself. Finally the Elector asks the officers if they are happy to continue to trust themselves to the Prince's leadership – to which <b>all</b> <b>say</b> yes.|$|E
2500|$|A shorter {{version of}} “Strix's” article {{appeared}} in The Spectator {{and this is}} the fourth essay of the book. “Strix”, pseudonym of [...] Peter Fleming, was a British adventurer and travel writer, who was James Bond author Ian Fleming’s elder brother and a friend of Nancy. He begins saying that Nancy Mitford's article has given rise to much pleasurable discussion. Before pushing on to the less etymological aspects of her theme, he addresses how language evolves and changes naturally, and U-slang, attributing to it a sense of parody. He says interest in the study of U-speech has been arbitrarily awakened and considers this interest unhealthy and contrary to the [...] "national interest". He closes his article hoping (ironically) that the U-young will strive for a clear, classless medium of communication in which <b>all</b> <b>say</b> [...] "Pardon?" [...] and none say [...] "What?", and every ball is a dance and every man's wife is [...] "the" [...] wife, but then saying that he will be surprised and disappointed if they do anything of the sort.|$|E

2500|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to whether}} Central Tibet conquered Zhangzhung {{during the reign of}} Songtsen Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Detsen (r. 755 until 797 or 804 CE). The Old Book of Tang do seems to place these events clearly in the reign of Songtsen Gampo, for they say that in 634, Yangtong (Zhangzhung) and various Qiang peoples [...] "altogether submitted to him." [...] Following this, he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha, or Tuyuhun, and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of (according to the Chinese) more than 200,000 men (100,000 according to Tibetan sources). He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. According to the Tang annals, he finally retreated and apologised, and, later, the emperor granted his request, but the histories written in Tibet <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that the Tibetan army defeated the Chinese and that the Tang emperor delivered a bride under threat of force.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{years into}} the French Revolution, German writer Johann von Goethe {{reportedly}} told the defeated Prussian soldiers after the Battle of Valmy that [...] "from this place and from this time forth commences {{a new era in}} world history, and you can <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that you were present at its birth". Historians widely regard the Revolution {{as one of the most}} important events in human history. The Revolution is often seen as marking the [...] "dawn of the modern era," [...] and its convulsions are widely associated with [...] "the triumph of liberalism". Describing the participatory politics of the French Revolution, one historian commented that [...] "thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organizations; and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became a tradition, and republicanism an enduring option". For liberals, the Revolution was their defining moment, and later liberals approved of the French Revolution almost entirely—"not only its results but the act itself," [...] as two historians noted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1885, {{after his}} return to America, Judge set about to revitalize the Movement in the United States. The real {{beginning}} {{of the work of}} Theosophy in the United States began in 1886, when Judge established The Path, an independent Theosophical magazine. Until this time, not much had been accomplished in the way of growth of the Society in America. [...] Mr. Judge addressed the common man in homely language and with simple reason. The Path showed that he had found himself and was now cultivating the area of his greatest usefulness, as a writer. His natural interest in the welfare of others affected everything he did, so that his articles and Theosophical talks are cast in the idiom of the common man.In his first editorial, he wrote: [...] "It is not thought that utopia can be established in a day...Certainly, if we <b>all</b> <b>say</b> that it is useless...nothing will ever be done. A beginning must be made and it has been made by the Theosophical society...Riches are accumulating {{in the hands of the}} few while the poor are ground harder every day as they increase in number...All this points unerringly to a vital error somewhere...What is wanted is true knowledge of the spiritual condition of man, his aim, and destiny...those who must begin the reform are those who are so fortunate as to be placed in the world where they can see and think out the problems all are endeavouring to solve, even if they know that the great day may not come until after their death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Evans, Barnes {{and young}} players like Steve McManaman, Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler (who {{had been given}} their debuts by either Dalglish or Souness) began playing attractive, attacking football, and were {{starting}} to look like title contenders again after several years of dominance in the title race by Manchester United as well as the likes of Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United. They won the League Cup in 1995, began challenging for the FA Premier League title, and lost the 1996 FA Cup Final to Manchester United. Barnes had now been converted into a holding midfielder where he, Redknapp and McManaman would pass their way through teams and set up goals. He often captained the side in 1995–96 when regular captain Ian Rush lost his place to new signing Stan Collymore, and when Rush departed to Leeds United {{at the end of the}} season he became full-time captain. Barnes played a pivotal role in the midfield, and created the final goal after a dribble and passing movement for Stan Collymoore during Liverpool's 4–3 win at Anfield against Newcastle. A young Jamie Carragher was breaking through into the team towards the end of Barnes's career at Liverpool and said that despite Barnes supposedly being past his peak by then, in his 34th year, he was still the best player at the club. [...] "Technically, he’s the best player I've ever trained or played with, he was great with both feet, they were both exactly the same. I'd say he's the best finisher I've ever played with (including Torres, Fowler, Owen). Barnes never used to blast his shots – they’d just get placed right in the corner. You speak with the players from those great Liverpool sides and ask them who the best player they played with was and they <b>all</b> <b>say</b> John Barnes".|$|E
