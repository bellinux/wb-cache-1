40|$|Random and {{pseudorandom}} number generators (RNG and PRNG) {{are used}} for many purposes including cryptographic, modeling and simulation applications. For such applications a generated bit sequence should mimic true random, i. e., by definition, such a sequence {{could be interpreted as}} the result of the flips of a fair coin with sides that are labeled 0 and 1. It is known that the Shannon entropy of this process is 1 <b>per</b> <b>letter,</b> whereas for any other stationary process with binary alphabet the Shannon entopy is stricly less than 1. On the other hand, the entropy of the PRNG output should be much less than 1 bit (<b>per</b> <b>letter),</b> but the output sequence should look like truly random. We describe random processes for which those, in a first glance contradictory properties, are valid. More precisely, it is shown that there exist binary-alphabet random processes whose entropy is less than 1 bit (<b>per</b> <b>letter),</b> but a frequency of occurrences of any word |u | goes to 2 −|u|, where |u | is the length of u.

40|$|Summary. The {{problem of}} ranking (or perfect hashing) {{is well known}} in Combinatorial Analysis, Computer Science, and Information Theory. There are widely used methods for ranking {{permutations}} of numbers { 1, 2, [...] ., n}, n ≥ 1, for ranking binary words of length n with a fixed number of ones and for many other combinatorial problems. Many of these methods have nonexponential memory size and the time of enumeration c 1 n c 2 bit operations <b>per</b> <b>letter,</b> where c 1 > 0, c 2 ≥ 1, n → ∞. In this paper we suggest a method which also uses non-exponential memory size and has the time of enumeration O((log n) const) bit operations <b>per</b> <b>letter,</b> const> 0, n → ∞.

40|$|Abstract — Erasure entropy rate (introduced {{recently}} by Verdú and Weissman) differs from Shannon’s entropy rate {{in that the}} conditioning occurs with respect to both {{the past and the}} future, as opposed to only the past (or the future). In this paper, universal algorithms for estimating erasure entropy rate are proposed based on the basic and extended context-tree weighting (CTW) algorithms. Consistency results are shown for those CTW based algorithms. Simulation results for those algorithms applied to Markov sources, tree sources and English texts are compared to those obtained by fixed-order plug-in estimators with different orders. An estimate of the erasure entropy of English texts based on the proposed algorithms is about 0. 22 bits <b>per</b> <b>letter,</b> which can be compared to an estimate of about 1. 3 bits <b>per</b> <b>letter</b> for the entropy rate of English texts by a similar CTW based algorithm.
