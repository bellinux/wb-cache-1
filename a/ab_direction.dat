40|$|Topological {{semimetal}} {{may have}} substantial applications in electronics, spintronics and quantum computation. Recently, ZrTe is predicted {{as a new}} type of topological semimetal due to coexistence of Weyl fermion and massless triply degenerate nodal points. In this work, the elastic and transport properties of ZrTe are investigated by combining the first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Calculated elastic constants prove mechanical stability of ZrTe, and the bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus and Possion's ratio also are calculated. It is found that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has slightly enhanced effects on Seebeck coefficient, which along <b>a(b)</b> and c <b>directions</b> for pristine ZrTe at 300 K is 46. 26 μV/K and 80. 20 μV/K, respectively. By comparing the experimental electrical conductivity of ZrTe (300 K) with calculated value, the scattering time is determined for 1. 59 × 10 ^- 14 s. The predicted room-temperature electronic thermal conductivity along <b>a(b)</b> and c <b>directions</b> is 2. 37 W m^- 1 K^- 1 and 2. 90 W m^- 1 K^- 1, respectively. The room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity is predicted as 17. 56 W m^- 1 K^- 1 and 43. 08 W m^- 1 K^- 1 along <b>a(b)</b> and c <b>directions,</b> showing very strong anisotropy. Calculated results show that isotope scattering produces observable effect on lattice thermal conductivity. It is noted that average room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity of ZrTe is slightly higher than that of isostructural MoP, which is due to larger phonon lifetimes and smaller Grüneisen parameters. Finally, the total thermal conductivity as a function of temperature is predicted for pristine ZrTe. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

The solid bulk products are characterized byX-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) is determined with an ammonia selective lectrode and the pH of {{the water from the}} first washing is measured. Ammonium-saponite s formed rapidly within 16 h. A higher NHa+/A 13 § molar ratio and the presence of F facilitate the crystallization of saponite. Small metastable amounts of bayerite, AI(OH) 3, are present at low NH 4 +/A 13 § molar ratios; after short reaction times, they disappear. During the first 4 h, the pH decreases rapidly, then drops slowly to a constant level of approximately 4. 6 after 60 h.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Raman {{microscopy}} of the kaolinite polymorphs {{was used}} to study single crystals and bundles of aligned crystals of kaolinite. The spectra of the hydroxyl stretching region were both sample and orientation dependent. Kaolinites can be classified into two groups according to {{the ratio of the}} intensities of the 3685 and 3695 cm 1 bands. No relationship was found between the d-spacing and the crystal domain size measurement from the 001 reflection and the Raman spectral intensities indicating the Raman spectra are independent of d-spacing and crystallinity. However, a relationship of the crystallinity in the <b>ab</b> <b>direction</b> and intensities of the 3685 and 3695 cm 1 bands indicate that the relative position of one layer to the other determines the position of the inner surface hydroxyl groups and the hydrogen bonding with the oxygen of the opposite layer.

40|$|The {{focal spot}} of a linear {{accelerator}} is often {{considered to have}} a fully stable position. In practice, however, the beam control loop of a linear accelerator needs to stabilize after the beam is turned on. As a result, some motion of the focal spot might occur during the start-up phase of irradiation. When acquiring portal images, this motion will affect the projected position of anatomy and field edges, especially when low exposures are used. In this paper, {{the motion of the}} focal spot and the effect of this motion on portal image analysis are quantified. A slightly tilted narrow slit phantom was placed at the isocenter of several linear accelerators and images were acquired (3. 5 frames per second) by means of an amorphous silicon flat panel imager positioned approximately 0. 7 m below the isocenter. The motion of the focal spot was determined by converting the tilted slit images to subpixel accurate line spread functions. The error in portal image analysis due to focal spot motionwas estimated by a subtraction of the relative displacement of the projected slit from the relative displacement of the field edges. It was found that the motion of the focal spot depends on the control system and design of the accelerator. The shift of the focal spot at the start of irradiation ranges between 0. 05 - 0. 7 mm in the gun-target (GT) direction. In the left-right (<b>AB)</b> <b>direction</b> the shift is generally smaller.

Here we investigate the transport of DNA-fragments across the intestinal barrier, focusing on transport mechanisms and rates. The human intestinal epithelial cell line CaCo- 2 was used as a model. As DNA material a PCR-fragment of 633 bp was used and quantitative real time PCR was used as detection method. DNA-fragments were found to be transported across polarized CaCo- 2 cells in the apical to basolateral <b>direction</b> (<b>AB).</b> After 90 min the difference in directionality AB vs. BA was > 10 (3) fold.

Several papers [3, 5, 8, 9] give approximation algo-rithms for SAPs. It is known (see, e. g., Lanthier et al. [5]) that a SAP can have many bends in the interior of a face, and there can be infinitely many SAPs even between two points in a common face. In practice, however, not all of these SAPs are equally good. For example, for robot motion planning, a SAP with fewer bends is preferable because a robot needs extra time and energy to change its direction at a bend. It is therefore natural to look for a SAP with a limited number of bends. We show here that the problem is hard: Theorem. Deciding if there exists a SAP of length at most L that has at most k bends is NP-complete. Our proof uses a reduction from 3 -SAT following the idea of Canny and Reif’s hardness result [2] for shortest paths among obstacles in 3 D, though our gadgets are different as our paths lie on a 2 D surface. Our problem is a bicriteria shortest path problem. See Mitchell [6, Sec. 4] for a survey and Daescu et al. [4] for more recent approximation algorithms. Many shortest path problems including anisotropic and bicriteria problems share the interesting feature that although approximation algorithms are the best results known, hardness proofs seem elusive. For example, the complexity of finding a shortest k-link path in a polygon is still open. Arkin et al.

As {{a result of this}} research, a better understanding of SrBIT properties was achieved. Thanks to a careful study of SrBIT processing as a bulk ceramic, a reproducible route was established. Many basic mechanisms leading to both SrBIT crystallization and sintering have been identified. It was demonstrated that a detailed knowledge of the exact processing conditions is required in order to achieve high quality material. DC conductivity measurements were carried out as a function of temperature, oxygen partial pressure and dopant concentration. It was found that the apparent activation energy for conduction for undoped SrBIT was 1 eV between 140 and 220 °C and 1. 5 eV between 450 and 700 °C. Decrease of the activation energy in the lower temperature range has been discussed considering grain boundary conductivity, as a transition from electronic to ionic conduction or as consequence of small polarons conduction. It was shown that lower activation energy resulted from Manganese doping (0. 5 eV), this was interpreted as either growing influence of grain boundary conductivity as dopant concentration increases or as shallow hole trap formation. DC conductivity measurements and acceptor/donor doping experiments demonstrated p-type conductivity in the low temperature range (up to 220 °C) as donor doping decreases conductivity, while oxygen partial pressure controlled measurements indicated n-type conductivity at higher temperature (above 700 °C). An electrical impedance analysis was performed with several equivalent circuits. The aim of these models was to simulate the impedance of SrBIT. The best approximation was found with a distributed element of Havriliak-Negami type. However, as the physical justification for this circuit was not clear, the investigation of the grain, grain boundary and electrode impedances was performed with multiple discrete parallel RC elements. With temperature, grain size and oxygen activity variations, the identification of three separate contributions as grain, grain boundary and electrode was realized.

From this finding and by comparing characteristic relaxation frequencies of undoped, 2 mol. % Mn and 4 mol. % Nb SrBIT, it was determined that conductivity is higher in the <b>ab</b> plane <b>direction</b> than in the c direction within both perovskite units and Bismuth oxide layers. With conductivity measurements under controlled oxygen partial pressure, it was found that an acceptor-based (intrinsic or extrinsic) model could be used to describe the electrical conductivity under controlled oxygen partial pressure of both undoped and 2 mol. % Mn doped SrBIT. However, as neither a pO 2 - 1 / 6 region (intrinsic oxygen vacancies compensated by electrons) for undoped SrBIT nor a pO 2 - 1 / 4 region (oxygen vacancies compensated by singly ionized acceptors) for Mn doped SrBIT were seen, it was concluded that the acceptorcontrolled model is not sufficient for a complete description of SrBIT. For this reason and in order to include the low oxygen partial pressure behavior of undoped SrBIT, a donor-based (intrinsic) model was also considered. The source of intrinsic donors would be in that case Bi 3 + cations sitting on Sr 2 + sites in the perovskite sublattice. Considering Bismuth vacancies as the negative compensating species, both pO 2 - 1 / 4 and pO 2 -independent regions could be predicted with the model. However, even if the donor-controlled model seems to better match conductivity measurements in the full PO 2) range, rejecting the acceptor-based model would be an error. It is actually not demonstrated that in SrBIT the concentration of exchanged Bismuth cations is always (all temperature, pressure) larger than the natural acceptor impurity concentration. It is very likely that the cation exchange is dependent of the oxygen partial pressure. It is also not proved as suggested in the literature that direct compensation between exchanged Strontium and Bismuth exists, reducing the net donor-excess. With the acceptor-controlled model, the mass-action constants for reduction and for ionization of intrinsic carriers across the band gap were determined. The band gap of SrBIT was estimated to be 3. 5 eV. The ionic conductivity of SrBIT was determined at high temperature with measurements under controlled oxygen partial pressure. It was found that the electrical conductivity of SrBIT is probably mixed (electronic and ionic) as the estimation of the transference number provided quite large values (t= 0. 8 at 800 °C).

Le Titanate de Strontium Bismuth (abrégé SrBIT) est un matériau très prometteur pour des applications piézo-électriques à haute température. Grâce à une température de transition de phase ferro-électrique élevée (530 °C), à des propriétés piézo-électriques très stables sous faible champ et à une conductivité électrique relativement basse à température ambiante (comparée à d'autres Titanates de Bismuth), ce matériau est très intéressant pour réaliser des capteurs de précision. Cependant, sous conditions extrêmes (basse fréquence, champ élevé, haute température ou basse pression d'oxygène), ces avantages disparaissent et la réponse piézo-électrique, dominée par les dérives de charge, devient instable. Mais avant tout, à haute température et basse pression d'oxygène, l'accroissement très fort de la conductivité réduit considérablement l'effet piézo-électrique de SrBIT. Dans ce travail, la conductivité électrique, les propriétés piézo-électriques et la permittivité diélectrique de SrBIT ont été étudiées à haute température, basse pression partielle d'oxygène, faible champ et fréquence. Cette recherche a permis une meilleure compréhension des propriétés de SrBIT. Par une étude détaillée de la préparation de SrBIT sous forme de céramique massive, une méthode de préparation reproductible a été établie. Différents mécanismes élémentaires qui interviennent lors de la cristallisation ou du frittage ont été identifiés. Mais, il a été démontré également qu'une connaissance pointue des paramètres du procédé est requise pour garantir la préparation de matériaux de bonne qualité. Des mesures de conductivité électrique de type DC ont été effectuées en variant la température, la pression partielle d'oxygène et la teneur en dopant. L'énergie d'activation pour la conductivité déterminée lors de ce travail de thèse est de 1 eV entre 140 et 220 °C et de 1. 5 eV entre 450 et 700 °C. La diminution de l'énergie d'activation dans la gamme inférieure de température a été interprétée comme la conséquence d'une conductivité aux joints de grain prépondérante à basse température. Les hypothèses de la transition d'un régime électronique à un régime ionique ou la conduction par polarons ont également été considérées. La diminution de l'énergie d'activation (0. 5 eV) par le dopage de type accepteur de SrBIT a été interprétée comme soit l'influence grandissante de la conductivité des joints de grains soit le piégeage des trous dans des niveaux peu profonds. Les mesures de conductivité DC et les dopages de type donneur et accepteur ont démontré une conductivité de type p dans la gamme inférieure de température (jusqu'à 220 °C), car l'ajout d'une certaine quantité de Niobium (donneur) diminue la conductivité de SrBIT. Par contre, les mesures effectuées à plus haute température sous pression partielle d'oxygène contrôlée indiquent une conductivité de|$|R
