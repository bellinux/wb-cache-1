25|$|The pH {{level of}} a wine is the {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} free (H+) hydrogen ions. It is related to the titratable <b>acidity</b> <b>level</b> of a wine but differs in significant ways. Low pH numbers indicate a high concentration of acids in a solution. While pure water is neutral with a pH of 7, wine tends to be more acidic with a pH between 3 and 4. As the acid levels in ripening grapes fall, the concentration of acids are lessening which means the pH level is rising. Yeasts, bacteria, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins which influence color all have varying tolerance to wines with high pH levels. In general, wines with high pH value tend to have duller colors and less developed flavors and be more prone to wine faults caused by spoilage organisms which makes monitoring the pH levels of grapes during ripening a priority for viticulturists and winemakers.|$|E

40|$|Since several years, our {{laboratory}} {{is studying}} the acidity in ionic liquids and showed that very acidic levels can be reached in these media when a strong acid is added.

Considering the attainable <b>acidity</b> <b>levels,</b> {{it turns out that}} the purity of these ionic solvents is very critical because all impurities (i. e methylimidazole, water, acetone, chloride …) can act as (strong) bases. Therefore, it is imperative to quantify these impurities to obtain reproducible results...|$|R

40|$|O uso de cobre na confecção de destiladores e acessórios para a indústria de bebidas destiladas é uma necessidade para o ganho de qualidade sensorial da bebida. O presente trabalho teve por escopo correlacionar o teor de cobre com o grau alcoólico e a acidez do destilado. Constatou-se que os teores de cobre durante a destilação acompanham os teores de acidez do destilado, encontrando-se ambos em maior concentração na fração cauda. Cortando-se a destilação do produto com alto grau alcoólico os teores de acidez e de cobre são reduzidos.
