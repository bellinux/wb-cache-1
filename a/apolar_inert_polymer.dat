A set of rationally designed polymers with affinity toward a signal molecule of V. fischeri, N-(β-ketocaproyl) -l-homoserine lactone (3 -oxo-C 6 -AHL) was produced. It is reported that computationally designed polymers could sequester a signal molecule of V. fischeri and prevent QS-controlled phenotypes (in this case, bioluminescence) from being up-regulated.

The protein by itself appears to have little impact on the size of the nucleoids as determined by fluorescent microscopy. However, it has a significant impact on the nucleoidal collapse by PEG. This is quantitatively explained by assuming the H-NS protein enhances the effective diameter of the DNA helix leading to an increase in the depletion forces induced by the PEG. Ultimately, however, the free energy of the nucleoid itself turns out to be independent of the H-NS concentration. This is because the enhancement of the supercoil excluded volume is negligible.

30|$|The goal of {{this work}} is {{to show how the}} changed {{arrangement}} of P 3 HT chains influences physical properties, such as electronic absorption spectrum, band gap, and emission QY of P 3 HT nanoscale particles. One promising strategy that enables one to tune photophysical properties of conjugated polymer films is blending with the other <b>inert</b> <b>polymer.</b> It is known {{that in the case of}} P 3 HT, its optical properties can be readily influenced by the presence of a suitable host medium. For example, Lee et al. showed that the optical transition energies in absorption and emission experiments of P 3 HT nanoparticles are affected by a hydrothermal (polar) treatment with deionized water at temperatures of up to 150  °C in an autoclave [10]. Hellmann et al. showed that blending of P 3 HT with the polar poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) leads to the increased 0 - 0 oscillator strength as well as to a considerable shift of the optical absorption spectrum by 0.1  eV [11]. In addition, Kim et al. observed similar changes in the optical properties of electrospun P 3 HT nanofibers after blending the P 3 HT and PEO and spinning them from polar solvent mixtures [12]. Other studies have demonstrated a minor redshift in the optical absorption spectrum of P 3 HT films by blending with poly(ethylene glycol) without the need for additional polar solvent additives [13]. Thus, the above experiments have indicated that the photophysical properties of P 3 HT can be readily manipulated by processing means. Although above studies showed significant influence of the host environment on band gap of P 3 HT aggregates, the changes in emission QY have been paid less attention. For example, Kanemoto et al. have showed that PL of conjugated polymers can be enhanced in the solid state by dilution using moderate <b>inert</b> <b>polymers</b> such as polypropylene [14]. However, this effect was achieved by conversion of aggregates to the molecular form of the conjugated polymer.|$|R
