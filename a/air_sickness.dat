His eye came cautiously down through the ribs and bars to a shining flight of white birds that hung in the lower sky. For a space he watched these. Then going lower and less apprehensively, he saw the slender figure of the Wind-Vane keeper's crow's nest shining golden in the sunlight and growing smaller every moment.

Its near edge came sharp and clear, and banished his last apprehensions in a shock of surprise.

Two names come in by the mail of two strong men dead--men that I dined and jested with only a little time ago, and it seems unfair that I should be here, cut off from the chain-gang and the shot-drill of our weary life. After all, there is no life like it that we lead over yonder. Americans are Americans, and there are millions of them; English are English; but we of India are Us all the world over, knowing the mysteries of each other's lives and sorrowing for the death of a brother. How can I sit down and write to you of the mere joy of being alive? The news has killed the pleasure of the day for me, and I am ashamed of myself. There are seventy brook trout lying in a creel, fresh drawn from Harrison Hot Springs, and they do not console me. They are like the stolen apples that clinch the fact of a bad boy's playing truant. I would sell them all, with my heritage in the woods and air and the delight of meeting new and strange people, just to be back again in the old galling harness, the heat and the dust, the gatherings in the evenings by the flooded tennis-courts, the ghastly dull dinners at the Club when the very last woman has been packed off to the hills and the four or five surviving men ask the doctor the symptoms of incubating smallpox.

It is necessary to determine, how much actually air pollution affects the health of the people. Hypothesis H 1 deals with question. In cooperation with the Department of Air Protection Hydro meteorological Institute in Ostrava and Regional hygiene station of Moravian-Silesian region, were compared data of the current PM 10 pollution particles weekly morbidity and acute respiratory diseases. If condition of the <b>air</b> worsens, <b>sickness</b> does not improve and when air quality is improving, declining disease and acute respiratory infections in the region - between air pollution and health status of the population is correlation. For hypothesis H 2 was created questionnaire, and was distributed to resident of region with rate of return of 87 %. The most general questions were answered correctly. The issue came to the question of determining current situation, so H 2 hypothesis was confirmed only partially. The only way how to do protecting the population it is functional warning. Also it was investigated by a special comparative method, when resident were warned in which value of the PM 10. 38 % residents say, that they were never warned, so the hypothesis H 3 was also confirmed partly. After analyzing the problem was created proposal how to deal with this situation in ORP Bohumín case. Inhabitants of the region were divided into two groups. Active group, it is {{a group of people who}} have internet connection and do not use it. It was therefore created information leaflet and stickers, whose main task is to attract attention and show the population, where information about current pollution can be found. Part of this leaflet is also notes, in which people were less informed in questionnaire. The second group is passive then ? residents who do not have internet access or they cannot us it. So it was crated a system of rotating information board, and design its location in the ORP Bohumín in an public areas, where accumulate a larger number of people. On such a board could be automatically sent actual time data through network communication. It would be also appropriate add alarm warning system, but its execution would have to be limited to a certain level due to the frequent exceed in most municipalities in the region. There would be also possibility to benefit a warning to citizens through the fire protection of Volunteer firefighter. Especially if was declared by smog situation. Of course there is a also the option to use warning sirens, but I think it such a way of warning could cause unnecessary panic. The following suggestions are valid for both groups. It was displayed map of Low Emission Zone form information available in ORP Bohumín. System of isolation green spaces [...] It was also examined whether the type of activity plan prepared long-term inverse situation in the region, but according to HZS does not pose a threat to the region, which would require the declaration of emergency state. So developments of operational plan isn´t necessary yet. However, the time is main aspect for gradual improvement of the warning and informing the population. The results showed that the general awareness of the issue is sufficient, but is also necessary to pay attention to the current situation in order to reduce the health risks to the lowest level. I am not sure that citizens must learn how to reconcile with living in conditions, but they should be patient, of course contribute to improve this situation by for example informing themselves about current pollution...|$|R
