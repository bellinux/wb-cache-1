5|$|Ewiniar {{hammered}} Okinawa {{with heavy}} rain, creating mass confusion and troubles for tourists. Flights and ferries out of Okinawa to neighbouring islands were cancelled, {{and as many}} as 3,500 tourists were left stranded at various airports because most hotels were already near full capacity. Other tourists reportedly stayed in the homes of some Okinawa residents, while some residents in landslide-prone areas evacuated to higher ground. Seven people were injured in Nanjo from a fallen signboard, while an elderly woman in Nago City and <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> Yaese suffered wind-related injuries.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{structure}} of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre.

5|$|In {{an early}} draft {{of what would}} later become Shakugan no Shana, Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a {{different}} dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; {{this was the first time}} Ito drew illustrations for a book.|$|E

The people of Esthar elect Laguna as their president and Ellone is sent back to Winhill without him. After Raine dies, her child (whom Ward and Kiros imply to be Squall in a conversation aboard the Ragnarok) and Ellone are sent to an orphanage. Laguna is unable to leave his post to visit her and remains president of Esthar to the present day. Ellone and Laguna are reunited in space, and Laguna helps the party prepare for their fight against Ultimecia.|$|E

Another elderly man enters a room in the house where there is another girl. Throughout the video, various scenes of older men and younger women appear. Towards the end of the video, Berrabah, Buchanan and Range are shown standing outside in the dark. A car stops next to the trio and they enter it. In the last scene, an elderly man watches by as the car drives off. Avril Cadden from the Sunday Mail praised the video as [...] "great". Former group member Buena expressed her dissatisfaction with it, saying: [...] "I just saw a bunch of perverted men and paedophile guys".

500|$|West regains his lyrical dexterity on [...] "Barry Bonds", a competitive, though {{friendly}} {{battle with}} Lil Wayne {{in which the}} two MCs exchange braggadocios rhymes. The song uses Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds as a metaphor for West's ability to create music hits. [...] "Drunk and Hot Girls" [...] is a first-person narrative that illustrates a man courting an attractive intoxicated woman in a club but gets more than what he bargained for. [...] "Everything I Am" [...] is a song of self-examination, in which West attempts to confront his fallacies by surveying the consequences of his outspokeness ruminating over various ways people expect him to conduct himself. In the track, West addresses his indifference towards constructing a gangster persona, his refusal to dress and act like every other rapper, his inclination towards social commentary, and his lack of self-restraint. West comes to the conclusion that while he {{will never be able to}} live up to people's expectations and will always be disadvantageously flawed; it's all these imperfections and more that serve to make up who he is. When writing the song, West thought of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> high school dealing with people coming down on her.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins and}} ends with the band in a {{hospital}} setting watching an old man being administered medication through an IV drip. The majority of the video {{takes place in a}} surreal outdoor setting that incorporates imagery from the film The Wizard of Oz. During the song's first verse, the old man from the hospital climbs onto a crow-ridden Christian cross. The second verse introduces <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> a white robe and peaked cap reaching for human fetuses in a tree, and an overweight woman in a suit with human organs painted onto it and with angel wings affixed to her back. In the video's final cut, the band is only shown performing in the outdoor setting during the choruses, where Cobain's face moves in and out of focus in the camera. While most of the video was devised by Cobain, Corbijn added elements such as the intentionally artificial crows, a ladder for the old man to climb onto the cross with, and a box with a heart at the top that the band performs inside of during the song's final chorus. Corbijn created another cut of the video featuring alternate footage during the final verse, including more shots of the young girl and the woman, and scenes of Cobain lying on his back in the poppy field, with mist surrounding him. This version of the video is featured on the DVD [...]|$|E
500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when I {{walked out of the}} theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times said it was a [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E
500|$|Gwenda Robb and Elaine Smith, {{in their}} Concise Dictionary of Australian Artists, {{considered}} Fuller's art {{to be created}} in [...] "a free painterly style indebted to Impressionism". During {{the first decade of}} the twentieth century, reviews drew attention to her distinctively Australian style. When one of Fuller's works was included in an exhibition of colonial artists in London (including paintings from Canada and Australia), the [...] correspondent from the Adelaide Advertiser described Fuller's contribution as [...] "most Australian in feeling". Reviewing her work hung in the Royal Academy in 1904, a Perth critic reported: [...] "Of the 16 or 17 Australian artists exhibiting at the Academy, Miss Fuller was the only one who chose a typically Australian scene. Her picture shows <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> <b>in</b> thin white, clinging, dress, standing on a bushy piece of country... As the London Observer says, the atmosphere that bathes the graceful figure of the girl is capitally managed with its note of subtropical heat". One reviewer thought very highly of her portraits, but was less convinced about Fuller's approach to the Australian light, writing:She had less success with our landscapes than with her figure subjects. That was the result of her passion for toning her pictures for ultimate indoor hanging. Thereby she lost, or illuminated, the hard Australian, hard light and shade, and startling relative values. Observable too was the influence of the English school in her rendering of our foliage; never could she bring herself to see our trees as dim coloured as they usually are.|$|E
