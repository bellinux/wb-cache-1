40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{considers}} collision <b>and</b> <b>grounding</b> of passenger ships. Subsequent to {{a collision}} or grounding, {{there might be}} water ingress into the compartments {{and the risk of}} sinking exists. In such circumstances, timely and effective evacuation of all passengers and crew will be extremely important, and failure to evacuate in time may lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper presents probabilities of collision <b>and</b> <b>grounding</b> <b>and</b> investigates possible events subsequent to an incident, e. g. possibilities of flooding, sinking and capsizing, expected time to sink, etc. Evacuations in case of collision <b>and</b> <b>grounding</b> are also considered and the consequences are estimated in terms of expected loss of lives. The risk associated with collision <b>and</b> <b>grounding</b> is hence estimated and compared to other types of accidents such as onboard fire...|$|R
