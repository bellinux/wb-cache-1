40|$|For wetting {{films in}} dilute {{electrolyte}} solutions close to charged walls we present analytic expressions for their effective interface potentials. The {{analysis of these}} expressions renders {{the conditions under which}} corresponding wetting transitions can be first- or second-order. Within mean field theory we consider two models, one with short- and one with long-ranged <b>solvent-solvent</b> <b>and</b> solvent-wall interactions. The analytic results reveal in a transparent way that wetting transitions in electrolyte solutions, which occur far away from their critical point (i. e., the bulk correlation length is {{less than half of the}} Debye length) are always first-order if the <b>solvent-solvent</b> <b>and</b> solvent-wall interactions are short-ranged. In contrast, wetting transitions close to the bulk critical point of the solvent (i. e., the bulk correlation length is larger than the Debye length) exhibit the same wetting behavior as the pure, i. e., salt-free, solvent. If the salt-free solvent is governed by long-ranged solvent-solvent as well as long-ranged solvent-wall interactions and exhibits critical wetting, adding salt can cause the occurrence of an ion-induced first-order thin-thick transition which precedes the subsequent continuous wetting as for the salt-free solvent.

40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of ion solvation {{in determining the}} properties of electrolyte solu-tions in aqueous–organic solvent mixtures is discussed. Solubility measurements are shown to be particularly useful for determining the Gibbs energies of transfer of ions between sol-vents, which reflect differences in the overall solvation of the ions in different solvent mix-tures. Solubility measurements {{can also be used}} to determine the other thermodynamic para-meters of transfer, but such quantities are usually better obtained by more direct methods. The inadequacy of current theories of ion solvation to quantitatively account for the thermo-dynamics of ion transfer is discussed by reference to measurements on some simple model systems. Although donor/acceptor interactions can explain many of the observed effects be-tween pure solvents, the situation is more complex in aqueous–organic mixtures because se-lective solvation <b>and</b> even <b>solvent–solvent</b> interactions may become significant.

There is a paucity of data relating to the use of SERS for the investigation of temperature dependent phenomena, particularly in relation to cross-linked supra-molecular polymeric systems. Microgels-also known as SMART materials- undergo a reversible volume phase transition (VPT) [1] as a function of temperature (Fig. 1). Macroscopically the VPT results from a combination of effects: the loss of interstitial bulk water molecules, changes in non-covalent molecular interactions (microgel-solvent, <b>solvent-solvent</b> <b>and</b> intra/inter-polymer chain) and conformational changes in the polymer backbone [2].

The ideal entropy of mixing of multiple pure compounds is always positive (the term -T∙ΔS is negative) and ΔG would be negative for all compositions, causing complete miscibility. Therefore, the fact that miscibility gaps are observed can only be explained by interaction. In the case of polymer solutions, polymer-polymer, <b>solvent-solvent</b> <b>and</b> polymer-solvent interactions have to be taken into account. A model for the phenomenological description of polymer phase diagrams was developed by Flory and Huggins (see Flory-Huggins solution theory).
