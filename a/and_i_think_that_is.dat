500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{possibility}} of al-Qaeda's connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings in 2005, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: [...] "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what has occurred here." ...|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a great pity. We did, and we left our mark." ...|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have.

2500|$|Dia often {{recorded}} a [...] "song diary," [...] an impromptu recorded song, on her MySpace page. She explained, [...] "It {{was something very}} raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what happened with many." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Hispanic Business article [...] "The Kings of Comebacks", Espuelas said, [...] "...we [...] {{wanted to}} redefine history - <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that...</b> <b>is</b> what happened", Mr. Espuelas {{writes in his}} 2004 book Life in Action. [...] "The StarMedia idea of Pan Latin Americanism, an idea with deep {{historical}} roots, was a profound turning point for Latinos across the world." [...] But {{in the spring of}} 2000, StarMedia suffered what the book calls [...] "the near-complete collapse of the Internet economy." [...] By his own calculation, Mr. Espuelas' StarMedia holdings at one point had a value of nearly $500 million, but he never sold a single share. [...] "I lived a full cycle", he tells Hispanic Business. [...] "It was the best business and personal experience I could have had at this point in my life. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century {{study was conducted}} with less bias than Gould had described; that [...] "contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's research was conducted with integrity". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he [...] "cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right." ...|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues <b>that</b> were personal, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> made him much more secretive <b>and</b> reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|R

2500|$|During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin {{expressed}} {{support for}} a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that [...] "Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, {{that that is what}} they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements." [...] Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that [...] "I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1999 to 2005, {{he was on}} {{the faculty}} of Baylor University, where he was a focus of {{attention}} and controversy. During the academic year 2005–2006, he was briefly the Carl F. H. Henry Professor of Theology and Science at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the first director of the school's new Center for Theology and Science (since replaced by prominent creationist Kurt Wise). The seminary teaches creationism but its professors vary on the details, with most adhering to the young Earth creationist viewpoint of a relatively recent creation which occurred literally as described in Genesis; Dembski does not hold to young Earth creationism (YEC). On his position at Southern, Dembski also remarked that [...] "Theology is where my ultimate passion is <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where I can uniquely contribute." [...] He left Southern in May 2006. Starting in June 2006 he became a professor in philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Since taking up a position within Southwestern's School of Theology in June 2006, Dembski has taught a number of courses within its Department of Philosophy of Religion. For some of his courses, he requires that his students promote intelligent design on [...] "hostile" [...] websites for course credit. The Southern Baptist Convention operates both seminaries.|$|E

6000|$|Then came a sudden, awful silence, as she recollected her audience, and blushed crimson {{with the}} misery of perceiving where her random shaft had struck, nor did either of us know what to say; but to our {{surprise}} it was Clarence who first spoke to relieve the desperate embarrassment.

60|$|There is {{just one}} trait of Uncle Abimelech's {{disposition}} more marked than his fondness for having his own way and that one thing is family pride. The Melvilles are a very old family. The name {{dates back to the}} Norman conquest when a certain Roger de Melville, who was an ancestor of ours, went over to England with William the Conqueror. I don't think the Melvilles ever did anything worth recording in history since. To be sure, as far back as we can trace, none of them has ever done anything bad either. They have been honest, respectable folks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> something worth being proud of.|$|E

I helped her dress and nothing would please her; she wanted to look that nice for Ronald's sake. She was a handsome bride; dressed in white, with red roses in her hair and at her breast. She wouldn't wear white flowers; she said they looked too much like funeral flowers. She looked like a picture. I can see her this minute, as plain as plain, {{just as she was}} that night, blushing and turning pale by turns, and looking at Ronald with her eyes of love. If ever a girl loved a man with all her heart Margaret Gordon did. It almost made me feel frightened.

6000|$|... "Do you wonder?" [...] {{returned}} his guest. [...] "Before {{the last great}} persecution {{he was one of}} our most faithful preachers of the Gospel, and when trouble came he always forgot himself in his eager desire to help and comfort others. Many a time has he guided and strengthened the Lord's people when they have been compelled to fly,--to travel weary and footsore by night, to wander in the dark forests, and hide in the gloomy caves. Wherever he went there was sunshine, because his heart was very full of the love of Jesus; and when he was led out to be speared, was he not faithful to the last? Perhaps we may be permitted to sing his own hymn along with him some day before the throne. No wonder that we love the words of Ramanisa. They called him Josiah when he was baptized, but he was Ramanisa when the Lord called him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the name that is written in the Book of Life." ...|$|E

Wade is going with us, at any rate for the present; you are a favorite of his, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the principal reason for his going. At any rate, when he heard I was in orders, he told the Colonel that, as there was no illness in the regiment, he thought, if he did not object, he would change places for a bit with M'Alaster, the assistant surgeon, who has been with the detachment at Deennugghur for the last year, so as to give him a turn of duty at Cawnpore, and do a little shikaring himself. There is more jungle and better shooting round Deennugghur than there is here, and you know the Doctor is an enthusiast that way. Of course, the Colonel agreed at once." ...|$|E
