In 2010, Bieber met Sam and John Shahidi, {{and he helped}} them develop the photo sharing app Shots. Shots was intended as an anti-bullying app, {{in which it was}} not possible to comment on others' pictures or to see how many [...] "likes" [...] another had received. Bieber was an investor in Shots. Boxer Floyd Mayweather also invested, and Bieber and Mayweather became friends through their business with Shots. At its peak, Shots had over 10 million users; Twitter tried to buy the app for US$150 million. With users dropping in 2016, Shahidi decided to change focus and rebrand Shots to Shots Studios, a talent agency and production company for online videos. Bieber is also an investor and <b>active</b> <b>business</b> <b>partner</b> in Shots Studios; Shahidi said that [...] "Justin is not just an investor, he's a partner (...) So he's got to be on the same page as Sam and I. He's got to really like the person. He's got to appreciate their art, whether it's comedy or music, and also like them as a person as well". In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington. He has bandwagoned four fragrances as of 2014. He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011; it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch. On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012. His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013, and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.|$|E
