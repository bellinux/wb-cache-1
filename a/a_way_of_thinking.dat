It refers to the fictional character Mr. Spock (a half-Vulcan) in Star Trek, who is often seen as a poster child for this caricature of rationality. On the contrary, Galef argues that Mr. Spock's failure to adjust his thinking, even though he experiences that humans do not always make rational decisions, {{is a case of}} irrationality. In 2011, Galef gave a talk on this subject at Skepticon.|$|E
25|$|Madilog {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{of evidence}} and fact {{in a way that}} fit into Indonesian demographics and culture, in line with Indonesian thinking on fundamentals. Evidence is fact and fact is founded on scientific evidence. There are two main ways of thinking in Western philosophy. The first is idea (mind), unity of thinking, and sense. The second is matter as tangible reality, objective in nature as existence. Those two concepts were combined in the same way of thinking for human beings, who are the subject living things. In Madilog, the main field is evidence. Although evidence can't be described rationally, scientifically—as to what, why, and how—evidence should be considered as a true way of thinking, the consequence of not thinking evidentially being logical fallacies and myth-making. This is the focus of the epistemology of Madilog, concerning truth, the validity of science, and the correlation of human knowledge to life. The epistemology is divided into three parts: definition, testing, and mathematical thinking.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} genre's punk and {{alternative}} rock roots, many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal {{of the early}} 1970s. Clinton Heylin, author of Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge, cited Black Sabbath as [...] "perhaps the most ubiquitous pre-punk influence on the northwest scene". Black Sabbath {{played a role in}} shaping the grunge sound, through their own records and the records they inspired. Musicologist Bob Gulla asserted that Black Sabbath's sound [...] "shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains". The influence of Led Zeppelin is also evident, particularly in the work of Soundgarden, whom Q magazine noted were [...] "in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo". Jon Wiederhorn of Guitar World wrote: [...] "So what exactly is grunge?...Picture a supergroup made up of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath and the Stooges, and you're pretty close." [...] Catherine Strong states that grunge's strongest metal influence was thrash metal, which had a tradition of [...] "equality with the audience", based on the notion that [...] "anyone could start a band" [...] (<b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> also shared by US hardcore punk, which Strong also cites as an influence on grunge) which was also taken up by grunge bands. Strong states that grunge musicians were opposed to the then-popular [...] "hair metal" [...] bands.|$|E

500|$|The Italian critic Franco Moretti {{argued that}} Austen's novels {{articulated}} {{a new form}} of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an [...] "eternal England", whose [...] "unpolitical" [...] works unlike the [...] "political" [...] novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of [...] "modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing [...] "Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the feel of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards [...] "an evolving national democracy", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and [...] "nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as {{different from the rest of}} Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of [...] "Anglo-Saxon civilisations", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its [...] "clear" [...] style and [...] "unpolitical" [...] way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and [...] "political" [...] way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.|$|E

Neither The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years nor any of Degas's other sculptures were cast in bronze during the artist's lifetime. [...] Degas scholars have agreed that the sculptures were not created as aids to painting, although the artist habitually explored ways of linking graphic art and oil painting, drawing and pastel, sculpture and photography. Degas assigned the same significance to sculpture as to drawing: [...] "Drawing is <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> modelling another".|$|E
2500|$|The problem, Horkheimer argued, is epistemological: {{we should}} reconsider {{not merely the}} {{scientist}} but the knowing individual in general. Unlike orthodox Marxism, which merely applies a ready-made [...] "template" [...] to both critique and action, critical theory seeks to be self-critical and rejects any pretensions to absolute truth. Critical theory defends the primacy of neither matter (materialism) nor consciousness (idealism), and argues that both epistemologies distort reality to the benefit, eventually, of some small group. What critical theory attempts {{to do is to}} place itself outside of philosophical strictures and the confines of existing structures. However, as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and [...] "recovering" [...] humanity's self-knowledge, critical theory often looks to Marxism for its methods and tools.|$|E

2500|$|Second-wave pro-feminism paid {{increased}} attention {{to issues of}} sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to more cooperation between the men's liberation and gay liberation movements. In part, this cooperation arose because masculinity was understood to be a social construction, and {{as a response to}} the [...] of [...] "men" [...] seen in previous men's movements. In 2010, Elizabeth Wilson wrote that the Gay Liberation Front and feminism worked alongside one another to [...] "spark <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about human relations in society that has led to significant change"; Peter Tatchell wrote about the GLF's [...] "idealistic vision [...] involved creating a new sexual democracy, without homophobia, misogyny, racism and class privilege".|$|E
2500|$|According to {{political}} scientist Joshua Kaplan, Tocqueville did not originate {{the concept of}} individualism, instead he changed its meaning, and {{saw it as a}} [...] "calm and considered feeling which deposes each citizen to isolate himself from the mass of his fellows and to withdraw into the circle of family and friends ... with this little society formed to his taste, he gladly leaves the greater society to look for itself". While Tocqueville saw egotism and selfishness as vices, he saw individualism as not a failure of feeling, but as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about things which could have either positive consequences such as a willingness to work together, or negative consequences such as isolation, and that individualism could be remedied by improved understanding.|$|E

[...] After digesting the experience silently, he then reenacted his experiences in play, talking about what he learned to whoever would listen or to himself. Gouin decided that language learning was a matter of transforming perceptions into conceptions, using language to represent what one experiences. Language is not an arbitrary set of conventions but <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and representing the world to oneself. It is not a conditioning process, but one in which the learner actively organizes his perceptions into linguistics concepts.|$|E

2500|$|Job, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Proverbs {{belong to}} the genre of wisdom literature, sharing a {{perspective}} that they themselves call the [...] "way of wisdom". Wisdom means both <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, {{as well as the}} ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety – except by God. The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes. Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE. Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job, and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.|$|E

Many motive, stylistic features, technical solutions appeared in all of the media and for Orosz it seemingly did not cause any problem to cross the borders of the different genres. When he was drawing a poster usually he did it with the preciseness of illustrators, when he was illustrating a book, he did it with the narrative mood of filmmakers, if he was animating films, sometimes he used the several layers approach of etchers and engravers and for prints he often chose the emblematic simplifying way of depiction of posters. If we call him only a poster designer based on his functional prints, we narrow down his field of activity, we go closer to the truth if we associate him with „postering" [...] as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> or if we call his many sided image depicting ourselves and our age as the poster-mirror of István Orosz.

2500|$|Coon's {{understanding}} of racial typology and diversity within the Indian sub-continent changed over time. In The Races of Europe, he regarded the so-called [...] "Veddoids" [...] of India ("tribal" [...] Indians, or [...] "Adivasi") as {{closely related to}} other peoples in the South-Pacific ("Australoids"), and he also believed that this supposed human lineage (the [...] "Australoids") was an important genetic substratum in Southern India. As for {{the north of the}} sub-continent, it was an extension of the Caucasoid range. By the time Coon coauthored The Living Races of Man, he thought that India's Adivasis were an ancient Caucasoid-Australoid mix who tended to be more Caucasoid than Australoid (with great variability), that the Dravidian peoples of Southern India were simply Caucasoid, and that the north of the sub-continent was also Caucasoid. In short, the Indian sub-continent (North and South) is [...] "the easternmost outpost of the Caucasoid racial region". Underlying all of this was Coon's typological view of human history and biological variation, <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> that is not taken seriously today by most anthropologists/biologists. Like all world regions, it is now understood by most scientists that the Indian sub-continent bleeds genetically into neighboring regions, being structured fluidly and continuously in a loose pattern of isolation-by-distance. Nevertheless, Coon's views are of historical interest, and are part of a long line of western anthropology which has sought to describe and conceptualize biological diversity in the sub-continent.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{the punk}} style was popular among people aged 18–22. Characterized by multi-colored mohawks, ripped skinny jeans, worn band tee-shirts, and denim or leather jackets. This style was popular {{among people who}} listened to punk music such as The Sex Pistols, and later, (despite the band's self-proclaimed rock'n'roll image) Guns N' Roses. Usually the denim jackets (which became an {{identity}} of the group) were adorned by safety pins, buttons, patches, and several other pieces of music or cultural memorabilia. Oftentimes, fans of the punk style would take random bits of fabric and attach them to their other clothes with safety pins. This soon became a popular way of attaching clothing, {{and it is now}} known as [...] "pin shirts" [...] with young women. The shirts are, essentially, rectangular pieces of fabric that are pinned on one side with safety pins. In the 1980s, a dressed down look (e.g. buzzed hair, T-shirts, jeans and button up shirts) was also very popular with people involved in punk rock, more specifically the hardcore punk scene. The Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris said [...] "Some of those punk rock kids they interviewed were a little over the top, but the thing historically is – the L.A./Hollywood punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we {{had nothing to do with}} that. Black flag and the Circle Jerks were so far from that. We looked like the kid who worked at the gas station or submarine shop." [...] Punk dress was not simply a fashion statement. It epitomized <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and seeing oneself as an individual cultural producer and consumer.
