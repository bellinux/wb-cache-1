5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and pale crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|E
500|$|The crag martins may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} swallows and martins in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins, and that species also treats common kestrels, [...] Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs. The dusky crag martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater false vampire bat, Megaderma lyra.|$|E
50|$|This small falcon {{is fairly}} distinctive, but may offer some {{confusion}} {{with a few}} other species. The rufous belly causes resemblance with <b>African</b> <b>hobby,</b> but important features to look for are a white throat and the obvious rufous patches on the nape. Alsom the underwing coverts are uniform rufous, whereas the <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> has more streaking. The most obvious underwing feature, though, is the flight feathers are barred black and white. whereas {{there is much more}} rufous color is in the flight feathers of the <b>African</b> <b>hobby.</b> The robust, long-winged Taita falcons have a short tail. Their flight is fast and somewhat heavy looking, but they are adept at aerial hunting.|$|E
50|$|In winter, {{the barn}} swallow is {{cosmopolitan}} in its choice of habitat, avoiding only dense forests and deserts. It is {{most common in}} open, low vegetation habitats, such as savanna and ranch land, and in Venezuela, South Africa and Trinidad and Tobago it is described as being particularly attracted to burnt or harvested sugarcane fields and the waste from the cane. In the absence of suitable roost sites, they may sometimes roost on wires where they are more exposed to predators. Individual birds tend {{to return to the}} same wintering locality each year and congregate from a large area to roost in reed beds. These roosts can be extremely large, one in Nigeria had an estimated 1.5 million birds. These roosts are thought to be a protection from predators, and the arrival of roosting birds is synchronised in order to overwhelm predators like <b>African</b> <b>hobbies.</b> The barn swallow has been recorded as breeding in the more temperate parts of its winter range, such as the mountains of Thailand and in central Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco cuvierii) {{is a small}} {{species of}} bird of prey in the family Falconidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> is a {{monotypic}} species. As {{a typical}} hobby {{it has been}} traditionally considered {{a member of the}} subgenus Hypotriorchis due to its similar morphology to the other hobbies.|$|E
50|$|Of the hobbys in {{existence}} including the <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> (Falco cuvierii) and the Oriental hobby (Falco severus), the Australian hobby {{is closely related}} to the northern hobby (Falco subbuteo) which inhabits Eurasia and migrates to Africa during winter.|$|E
50|$|Predatory bats such as {{the greater}} false vampire bat are known to prey on barn swallows. Swallows at their {{communal}} roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities. Falcon species confirmed as predators include the peregrine falcon and the <b>African</b> <b>hobby.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{specials}} {{that occur}} in Mapungubwe National Park include great white pelican, white-backed night heron, bat hawk, augur buzzard, <b>African</b> <b>hobby,</b> Dickinsonâ€™s kestrel, green sandpiper, three-banded courser, blue-spotted wood dove, grey-headed parrot, Senegal coucal, pennant-winged nightjar, blue-cheeked bee-eater, broad-billed and racket-tailed roller, African golden oriole and olive-tree warbler.|$|E

50|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, and rock martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> and wintering Eurasian hobby. Rock martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over the martin's nests. In 1975, {{one of the first}} findings of the tick Argas (A.) africolumbae was in a nest of Ptyonoprogne f. fusciventris in Kenya, at that time the martin was described under its synonym Ptyonoprogne fuligula rufigula (Fischer & Reichenow).|$|E
50|$|Hunts on the wing, mainly at {{dawn and}} dusk. When not {{breeding}} the <b>African</b> <b>hobby</b> is thought to feed almost entirely on flying insects: termite alates, grasshoppers, locusts, beetles and cicadas have all been recorded. Feeding concentrations of up to 30 birds have been recorded when termite alates or locusts are swarming. When breeding {{a high proportion of}} small birds such as weavers, estrildid finches and swallows up to the size of doves are favoured. It hunts either by making sorties from a perch or quartering across favoured hunting areas at 50-100m. Normally encountered as solitary birds but sometimes in pairs or small family groups. For nesting they use the old stick nests of other birds, especially black kite, which are situated high in a tree. Breeding has been recorded in December to June {{in the western part of}} the range, August to December in equatorial East Africa and September to January in southern Africa.|$|E
