40|$|The {{results of}} enter sorbent — dioctahedral Smectite (Neosmektin) — usage {{as part of}} complex therapy of {{children}} with atopic dermatitis (ATD). It is shown that the administration of Smectite favored better efficacy of baseline treatment of ATD, more express and quick regression of skin manifestations of the disease, decrease in number of children with eosinophilia. High efficacy of ATD treatment with Smectite indicates the pathogenetic justification of efferent therapy of the disease. Observation results witness the good tolerability of Smectite: side effects related to the treatment were only observed in 14 percent of children.

40|$|The {{patient is}} {{the centre of}} a web of {{relationships}} {{and the impact of}} his/her disease on family members and caregivers must be taken into account. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the specific instruments that measure the impact of a dermatological disease on the quality of life (QoL) of family members, by performing a systematic search of the literature. Fifteen papers were identified, describing the creation and validation of nine instruments. Four of them concerned atopic dermatitis (Dermatitis Family Index, DFI; Parents’ Index QoL Atopic Dermatitis, PiQoL-AD; QoL in Primary Caregivers of children with Atopic Dermatitis, QPCAD; Childhood <b>Atopic</b> <b>Dermatits</b> Impact Scale, CADIS), two measured the impact of psoriasis in family members (Psoriasis Family Index, PFI; FamilyPso), one the impact of epidermolysis bullosa (Epidermolysis Bullosa Burden of Disease, EB-BoD), one of ichthyosis (Family Burden Ichthyosis, FBI), and one was generic for dermatological conditions (Family Dermatology Life Quality Index, FDLQI). The EADV quality of life taskforce recommends that the impact of a skin disease on family and caregivers should be measured as part of any thorough evaluation of the burden of a disease. Guidelines are given to choose the most appropriate instruments...|$|E
