A seatbelt applies an opposing force to the driver <b>and</b> <b>passengers</b> to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car. Seatbelts are considered Primary Restraint Systems (PRS), because of their vital role in occupant safety.|$|R
5|$|Unlike the loaned {{locomotives}} <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> carriages, the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright. Despite this, {{they were}} always painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR (SR after 1923), to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC.|$|E
5|$|With railroads {{becoming}} the dominant form of long-range shipping <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> {{travel in the}} early 1870s, riverboats like those in Omaha became obsolete. However, as late at 1949 the steamship Avalon was letting passengers in Omaha, before {{becoming one of the}} famous St. Louis steamboats in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Although sales {{never fully}} recovered, the {{improved}} Comet2 and the prototype Comet3 {{culminated in the}} redesigned Comet4 series which debuted in 1958 and had a productive career of over 30years. The Comet was adapted {{for a variety of}} military roles such as VIP, medical <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> transport, as well as surveillance. The most extensive modification resulted in a specialised maritime patrol aircraft variant, the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. Nimrod remained in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) until June 2011, over 60 years after the Comet's first flight.|$|E

50|$|Ships of the 17th {{century were}} {{generally}} smaller than , so the accommodations on board were modest.

50|$|The murder, looting, {{and general}} {{destruction}} of property was well organised. And mobs armed with petrol were seen stopping passing motorists at critical street junctions.

5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, the Norwegian State Railways sought a new {{locomotive}} type to replace its aging fleet of Di 3 diesel-electric locomotives, which {{made up the}} back-bone of the dieselized operations. The new locomotives were planned for use as freight <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> trains on the Nordland Line, {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. In 1980, NSB had taken delivery of five Di4 from Henschel. Originally there were plans to order additional Di 4 units, but this was discarded and instead a new class was pursued, as NSB wanted similar, but slightly more modern, locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> traffic {{remained}} relatively {{strong in the}} 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|From 1927, {{the first}} pure through-passenger trains started {{operating}} in the summer, towards Sweden {{in the morning and}} back during the evening. From 1933 it operated all year. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many shorter distances received extra trains, <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> and freight trains were gradually separated into separate trains. The traffic through Trondheim–Hell increased; commuter trains terminated at several different stations. From 1930, multiple units were also put into use on the line.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{increase}} in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 financial year, less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six eastbound and eight westbound trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service levels have increased to 21 westbound trains and 18 eastbound per weekday, <b>and</b> <b>passenger</b> levels have more than quadrupled, to 102,654 in 2013/14.|$|E
