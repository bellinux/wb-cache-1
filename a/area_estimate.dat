30|$|To {{accept or}} reject the {{omission}} or commission error, the standard error and confidence interval of each land use class must be estimated. Therefore, the standard error of each land use class, SE (Pj), was calculated using Eq.  3 and presented in Table  4. Then the standard error of the adjusted <b>area</b> <b>estimate</b> was calculated {{as the product}} of the total mapped area (i.e. 155  ha) and Pj (Table  4). A 95 % confidence interval (Z =  1.96) was used to assess the accuracy of each land use class. Then the confidence interval for the estimated area of each land use class (A) was calculated as, A = Lj ±  1.96 (SEi), where Lj refers estimated area of a given land use class and SEi is the standard error of the adjusted <b>area</b> <b>estimate.</b> For example, the confidence interval for the area of cropland in 2010 is 140  ha ±  4.4 (1.96) =  148.5  ha (Table  4).|$|E

In area estimation filtering improved the overestimate of 4. 5 % to 2. 7 % and the root-mean-square error decreased from 126. 18 ha to 107. 02 ha.

40|$|The {{need for}} small <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> is {{increasingly}} felt {{in both the}} public and private sectors in order to formulate their strategic plans. It is now widely recognized that direct small <b>area</b> survey <b>estimates</b> are highly unreliable owing to large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small <b>area</b> <b>estimates.</b> For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of models to link these areas. Improved small <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> are found by "borrowing strength" from similar neighboring areas.

The estimated true area proportion from the contingency table and two calibration approaches showed significant improvement when compared with uncalibrated values. However, there is no significant difference among the estimates from the contingency table and the two calibration methods. Although the inverse method led to mean estimates closer to the true values for all classes than other methods, comparing the individual area estimates for each class showed that the inverse method did not always produce the most accurate estimate.

40|$|The {{catchment}}, or catchment area, is {{the area}} associated with a segment of a drainage network. Surface runoff in a catchment flows into the associated network segment. Catchment area is commonly used for estimating watershed parameters, such as upstream drainage area, flood frequency, or surface-water flow. Hydrologic analyses require relatively accurate catchment <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> to furnish substantive conclusions. Conversely, alternative uses for catchment area may not require such precise estimates. Estimation of catchment areas using Thiessen polygons around evenly spaced points along network features is a rapid and computationally simple approach {{when compared to the}} alternative of deriving catchments from an elevation model; however, Thiessen-estimated catchments do not precisely follow the ridgelines of surface models and only provide approximate subdivisions of the watershed.

In this study, a rigorous intercomparison of the burnt <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> derived by these two products is performed in a geographical information system (GIS) environment for the Greek fires that occurred from 2005 to 2007. For the same temporal interval, the relationships of the burnt <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> by each product are examined with respect to land use/cover and elevation derived from CORINE 2000 and the ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM), respectively.
