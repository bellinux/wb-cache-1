50|$|The Officer of the Deck would {{appraise}} {{the tactical}} situation before commencing preparations for proceeding to periscope depth. “Prepare to snorkel” would be ordered over the 1 MC, the ship-wide <b>announcing</b> <b>system.</b> The ship would first {{be brought to}} periscope depth followed by a shallower snorkel depth. When preparations to snorkel had been completed, the order was issued to “Commence snorkeling”.Back-up electrical capacity was now available. While recovery from the reactor scram continued, the ship remained at snorkel depth with multiple masts raised; periscope, snorkel mast, ESM mast, communications mast, and at times the satellite navigation mast. At higher sea states, the shallow depth required diligent ship and depth control to prevent the broaching of the hull, and the loss, by cutting from the screw, of the VLF floating wire streaming from the sail.|$|E
5000|$|... 1 Main Circuit (1MC) is {{the term}} for the {{shipboard}} public address circuits on United States Navy and United States Coast Guard vessels. This provides a means of transmitting general information and orders to all internal ship spaces and topside areas, and is loud enough that all embarked personnel are able to (normally) hear it. It is used to put out general information to the ship’s crew {{on a regular basis}} each day. The system consists of an amplifier-oscillator group which is located in the IC/gyro room, a microphone control station, portable microphones at each control station and loudspeakers located throughout the ship. Control stations for the 1MC <b>announcing</b> <b>system</b> are located at the pilot house, OOD stations on the quarterdecks, after steering and Damage Control Central area.|$|E
5000|$|The alarm is [...] On early submarines, it was {{an actual}} {{motor-driven}} vibratory horn (called a klaxon after the popular Klaxon Horn used on automobiles); later classes used electronic signal generators in the General <b>Announcing</b> <b>System</b> (1MC) that did not sound much like a klaxon but were variously described as [...] "blats," [...] "honks," [...] or [...] "." [...] Motor-driven horns supplied by Benjamin Electric (Type H-9 horn) were installed in WW2 fleet submarines. Later motor-driven horns were mostly supplied by Federal Electric (later Federal Sign and Signal, changing finally to Federal Signal - Type H-8 horn) and are still found in certain applications today. Many modern submarines still have Klaxon diving alarms (mostly supplied by crew members or unofficial sources, usually not NAVSEA) paying homage to USN submarine tradition.|$|E

Hendricks and others lobbied vigorously within IBM for a change in direction, but were rebuffed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} the {{portable}} automatic conjecturing and <b>announcing</b> <b>system</b> for real-time accident detection. There are six sensors with 3 -axis accelerometers and the ZigBee transmission standard {{mounted on the}} patients ' specific region. After being transmitted to the mobile device through the ZigBee devices, the data are analyzed immediately. When the accident occurs, the mobile device could get the user's location with Assisted Global Positioning System (AGPS) and transmit the information of accident to the medical staff through the 3 rd-generation (3 G) network. The medical staff will make a careful check of this accident with the patient again. In order to improve the limit of Regional Health Network (RHN), the environment constraints, the mobile computing capability, the power consumption and the device portability are considered in this system architecture we proposed...|$|E
