5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts.

The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for.

A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf. If a company {{does not have enough}} assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors.

2500|$|Before <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>can</b> {{market a}} generic drug, {{it needs to}} file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to {{demonstrate}} therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved [...] "reference-listed drug" [...] and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. [...] For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires the bioequivalence of a generic drug to be between 80% and 125% of the innovator product. (This range {{is part of a}} statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a personâ€™s body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug. [...] Non-innovator versions of biologic drugs, or biosimilars, require clinical trials for immunogenicity in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch-to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules.|$|E
2500|$|While {{a limited}} company is {{deemed to be}} a legal person {{separate}} from its shareholders and employees, {{as a matter of}} fact <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>can</b> only act through its employees, from the board of directors down. So there must be rules to attribute rights and duties to a company from its actors. This usually matters because an aggrieved third party will want to sue whoever has money to pay for breach of an obligation, and companies rather than their employees often have more money. Up until reforms in 2006 this area used to be complicated significantly by the requirement on companies to specify an objects clause for their business, for instance [...] "to make and sell, or lend on hire, railway-carriages". If companies acted outside their objects, for instance by giving a loan to build railways in Belgium, any such contracts were said to be ultra vires and consequently void. This is what happened in the early case of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co Ltd v Riche. The policy was thought to protect shareholders and creditors, whose investments or credit would not be used for an unanticipated purpose. However, it soon became clear that the ultra vires rule restricted the flexibility of businesses to expand to meet market opportunities. Void contracts might unexpectedly and arbitrarily hinder business. So companies began to draft ever longer objects clauses, often adding an extra provision stating all objects must be construed as fully separate, or the company's objects include anything directors feel is reasonably incidental to the business. Now the 2006 Act states that companies are deemed to have unlimited objects, unless they opt for restrictions. The 2006 reforms have also clarified the legal position that if a company does have limited objects, an ultra vires act will cause the directors to have breached a duty to follow the constitution under section 171. So a shareholder who disagreed with an action outside the company's objects must sue directors for any loss. Contracts remain valid and third parties will be unaffected by this alone.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{companies}} may be incorporated under the Companies Act 2006. The {{people interested in}} starting the enterprise - the prospective directors, employees and shareholders - may choose, firstly, an unlimited or a limited company. [...] "Unlimited" [...] will mean the incorporators will be liable for all losses and debts under the general principles of private law. The option of a limited company leads to a second choice. <b>A</b> <b>company</b> <b>can</b> be [...] "limited by guarantee", meaning that if the company owes more debts than it can pay, the guarantors' liability {{will be limited to}} the extent of the money they elect to guarantee. Or a company may choose to be [...] "limited by shares", meaning capital investors' liability is limited to the amount they subscribe for in share capital. A third choice is whether a company limited by shares will be public or private. Both kinds of companies must display (partly as a warning) the endings [...] "plc" [...] or [...] "Ltd" [...] following the company name. Most new businesses will opt for a private company limited by shares, while unlimited companies and companies limited by guarantee are typically chosen by either charities, risky ventures or mutual funds wanting to signal they will not leave debts unpaid. Charitable ventures also have the option to become a community interest company. Public companies are the predominant business vehicle in the UK economy. While far less numerous than private companies, they employ the overwhelming mass of British workers and turn over the greatest share of wealth. Public companies can offer shares to the public, must have a minimum capital of Â£50,000, must allow free transferability of its shares, and typically (as most big public companies will be listed) will follow requirements of the London Stock Exchange or a similar securities market. Businesses may also elect to incorporate under the European Company Statute as a Societas Europaea. An [...] "SE" [...] will be treated in every European Union member state {{as if it were a}} public company formed in accordance with the law of that state, and may opt in or out of employee involvement.|$|E

2500|$|Companies {{are legal}} persons, created by {{registering}} a constitution and paying a fee, at Companies House. Like a natural person, <b>a</b> <b>company</b> <b>can</b> incur legal duties and can hold rights. During its life, a company {{must have a}} board of directors, which usually hires employees. These people represent the company, and act on its behalf. They can use and deal with property, make contracts, settle trusts, or maybe through some misfortune commission torts. A company regularly becomes indebted through all of these events. Three main kinds of debts in commerce are, first, those arising through a specific debt instrument issued on a market (e.g. a corporate bond or credit note), second, through loan credit advanced to a company on terms for repayment (e.g. a bank loan or mortgage) and, third, sale credit (e.g. when a company receives goods or services but has not yet paid for them. However, the principle of separate legal personality means that in general, the company is the first [...] "person" [...] to have the liabilities. The agents of a company (directors and employees) are not usually liable for obligations, unless specifically assumed. Most companies also have limited liability for investors. Under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 74(2)(d) this means shareholders cannot be generally sued for obligations a company creates. This principle generally holds wherever the debt arises because of a commercial contract. The House of Lords confirmed the [...] "corporate veil" [...] will not be [...] "lifted" [...] in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd. Here, a bootmaker was not liable for his company's debts {{even though he was}} effectively the only person who ran the business and owned the shares. In cases where a debt arises upon a tort against a non-commercial creditor, limited liability ceases to be an issue, because a duty of care can be owed regardless. This was held to be the case in Chandler v Cape plc, where a former employee of an insolvent subsidiary company successfully sued the (solvent) parent company for personal injury. When the company has no money left, and nobody else can be sued, the creditors may take over the company's management. Creditors usually appoint an insolvency practitioner to carry out an administration procedure (to rescue the company and pay creditors) or else enter liquidation (to sell off the assets and pay creditors). A moratorium takes effect to prevent any individual creditor enforcing a claim against the company. so only the insolvency practitioner, {{under the supervision of the}} court, can make distributions to creditors.|$|E
