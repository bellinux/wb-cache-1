5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or the lines <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has}} been ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E

40|$|The self can be {{understood}} in objective metaphysical terms as a bundle of properties, as a substance, or as {{some other kind of}} entity on our metaphysical list of what there is. Such an approach explores the metaphysical nature of the self when regarded from a suitably impersonal, ontological perspective. It explores the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the self in objective reality, that is, the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the self from without. This is the objective self. I am taking a different approach. In addition to objective reality, which is usually understood and explored from an impersonal, quasi-observational and metaphysically realist perspective, we can also explore the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of subjective reality. The nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of subjective reality is defined by the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of first-personal, conscious experience. Subjective reality is as real as objective reality, and a metaphysical realist such as myself can endorse the existence of both kinds of ontology. The mental states that, as experienced from the first-personal or subjective perspective, capture the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of subjective reality, are included in objective reality. The questions to explore in a subjective ontology of the self concern the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the self from the first-personal or subjective perspective, that is, the nature <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the self from within.

5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. GDI units are sturdy and powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, Nod armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while Nod creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> in total. Tiberium, the game's sole resource, is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing.

Obtaining design solutions that satisfy an evaluation of form such as originality <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> such as strength (satisfactory design solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure)</b> are necessary. However, conventional structural optimization methods are difficult to obtain satisfactory design solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> This paper described a design method that supports for obtaining satisfactory design solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> Obtaining diverse design solutions by searching globally from the solution space was expected to support for obtaining satisfactory design solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure,</b> therefore, an emergent form-generation system that can obtain diverse forms self-organizationally was proposed. The present study applied the emergent form-generation system to the chair design and verified the effectiveness of referring to the diverse forms obtained by the proposed system for obtaining the satisfactory solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> Firstly, the subjects were asked to draft design ideas of chairs without referring to anything. Secondly, they were asked to draft design ideas of chairs with referring to the diverse forms obtained by the emergent form-generation system. Thirdly, influence of referring to the diverse forms on the design ideas was analyzed by the cognitive experiment on diversity of design ideas. As a result, effectiveness of the emergent form-generation system for obtaining the satisfactory design solutions of form <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> was indicated...|$|R

The preparation of bimetallic catalysts with controlled metal surface composition <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> is very challenging. In this study, we synthesize a series of Ni/Pt bimetallic catalysts with controlled metal surface composition <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> using a method derived from surface organometallic chemistry. The evolution of the surface composition <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> of the obtained bimetallic catalysts under simulated reaction conditions is investigated by various techniques, which include CO-probe IR spectroscopy, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, X-ray absorption near-edge <b>structure</b> analysis, XRD, <b>and</b> X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the structure of the bimetallic catalyst is evolved from Pt monolayer island-modified Ni nanoparticles to core-shell bimetallic nanoparticles composed of a Ni-rich core and a Ni/Pt alloy shell upon thermal treatment. These catalysts are active for the dry reforming of methane, and their catalytic activities, stabilities, and carbon formation vary with their surface composition <b>and</b> <b>structure.</b> The reform of reforming: A series of alumina-supported Ni/Pt bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with controlled surface composition <b>and</b> <b>structure</b> are prepared.
