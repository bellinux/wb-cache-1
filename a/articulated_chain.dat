40|$|Abstract. The area of inverse {{kinematics}} of robots, mainly manipula-tors, {{has been widely}} researched, and several solutions exist. The solu-tions provided by analytical methods are specific to a particular robot configuration and are not applicable to other robots. Apart from this drawback, legged robots are inherently redundant because {{they need to have}} real humanoid configurations. This degree of redundancy makes the development of an analytical solution for the {{inverse kinematics}} practi-cally unapproachable. For this reason, our proposed method considers the use of artificial neural networks to solve the inverse kinematics of the <b>articulated</b> <b>chain</b> that represents the robot’s legs. Since the robot should always remain stable and never fall, the learning set presented to the artificial neural network can be conveniently filtered to eliminate the un-desired robot configurations and reduce the training process complexity. ...|$|E

Experiments using synthetic images show how this approximation performs correctly and, how to solve difficult situations that occur when there are motions that do not imply to the end-effectors. Besides, we have evaluated our approach using real images, including sequences of a known human motion database in order to compute quantitative results. The computed error, about 2 centimeters, {{can be considered as}} sufficiently small to permit its use in motion capture applications. Moreover, adding the image constraint implies that the solution of the kinematic chain is more independent on initial configuration.|$|E

We show that geometric stiffness, the tensor encoding the change of force directions (as opposed to intensities) {{in response to a}} change of positions, is the missing piece between the two approaches.

Such methods include a way to solve for the redundancy in the orientation of the neck link, as well as three different methods to solve the redundancy of the articulated human arm. The first method involves eliminating a degree of freedom from the chain, thus reducing its redundancy. The second method calculates the elevation angle of the elbow position from the elevation angle of the hand. The third method determines the actual position of the elbow from an average of previous positions of the elbow according to the position and orientation of the hand. The previous positions of the elbow are captured during the calibration process. The redundancy of the neck is easily solved due to the small amount of redund~ncy in the chain. When solving the arm, the first method which should give a perfect result in theory, gives a poor result in practice due to the limitations of both the motion capture equipment and the de~gn. The second method provides an adequate result for· the position of the redundant elbow in most cases although fails in some cases. Still it benefits from a simple approach as well as very little need for calibration. The third method provides the most accurate method of the three for the position of the redundant elbow although it also fails in some cases. This method however requires a long calibration session for each user. The last two methods allow for the calibration data to be used in latter session, thus reducing considerably the calibration required. In combination with a virtual reality system, these processes allow for the real-time animation of an articulated figure to drive avatars in virtual environments or for low quality animation on a low-end computer. ...|$|R

40|$|In this chapter, we {{consider}} the geometry of configurations of points generated by arbitrary sets of positions of a rigid body. The goal is to find those points in the moving body that lie on specific algebraic surfaces. The result {{is a set of}} algebraic equations that can be remarkably complex. The problem originates with Burmester’s determination (Burmester 1886 [3]) of points in a body that lie on a circle for an arbitrary set of five planar po-sitions. He used these Burmester points to design a linkage that guided the body through the specified positions. His result was a graphical solution to a set of five quadratic equations in five unknown paramters. Today, these equa-tions are relatively easy to solve numerically, see Suh and Radcliffe (1978) [32], Sandor and Erdman (1984) [26], or McCarthy (2000) [15]. Chen and Roth (1967) [4] introduced a generalization of this problem which seeks points and lines in a moving body that take positions on surfaces as-sociated with <b>articulated</b> <b>chains</b> used to build robot manipulators. See Craig (1989) [5] or Tsai (1999) [34] for a discussion of serial chain robots. Our focus is two-jointed chains that supports a spherical wrist. The center of this wrist traces a surface which is said to be “reachable ” by the chain. Considering the various ways of assembling these <b>articulated</b> <b>chains,</b> we obtain seven reachable algebraic surfaces, and the problem reduces to computing the dimensions of these chains from a set of polynomial equations. It is interesting how quickly the complexity of the problem increases with the number of dimensional parameters and the degree of the surface. The total degree of the polynomial systems that {{we consider}} range from 32 for the simplest to over 4 million for the most complex.
