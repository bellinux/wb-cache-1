40|$|This paper focusses on the {{strategic}} {{steps in the}} design, operation and response of tray to tray temperature in a binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> {{to changes in the}} reflux flow rate. The temperature profile of a <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is an important parameter in the determination of the column performance. A model for the tray dynamics in <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is developed and used to determine the temperature profile of a binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> that have been subjected to sudden changes in reflux flow rate.

Thus, the binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> equations presented in this paper for the response of tray to tray temperature due to sudden changes in reflux flow rate can be used to predict the tray to tray temperature in multi-component <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> that result from sudden changes in the reflux flow rate in such column.
