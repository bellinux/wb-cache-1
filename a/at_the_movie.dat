5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E

5|$|The Progress Party {{was founded}} {{at a meeting}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater Saga Kino in Oslo on 8 April 1973, {{attended}} by around 1,345 persons. The address was held by Anders Lange, after whom the party was named Anders Lange's Party for a Strong Reduction in Taxes, Duties and Public Intervention, commonly known as Anders Lange's Party, and abbreviated ALP. Lange had some political experience from the interwar era Fatherland League, and {{was part of the}} Norwegian resistance movement during the Second World War. Since the end of the war, he had worked as an independent right-wing political editor and public speaker. Lange held his first public speech as chairman of ALP at Youngstorget in Oslo on 16 May the same year. ALP was to a large extent inspired by the Danish Progress Party, which was founded by Mogens Glistrup. Glistrup also spoke at the event, which gathered around 4,000 attendees.|$|E

Houston's first film role was in The Bodyguard, released in 1992 and co-starring Kevin Costner. Houston played Rachel Marron, a star who is stalked by a crazed fan and hires a bodyguard to protect her. USA Today listed {{it as one of}} the 25 most memorable movie moments of the last 25 years in 2007. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> color-blind.|$|E

25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E

500|$|Midway {{through the}} film, Tyler Durden {{points out the}} cue mark—nicknamed [...] "cigarette burn" [...] in the film—to the audience. The scene {{represents}} a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the [...] "fairly subjective reality" [...] that existed earlier in the film. The director explained, [...] "Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> {{in a whole new}} way." ...|$|E

500|$|Clark's adoptive father. Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E
50|$|The film is so titled in {{reference}} to the statistic that the average sixteen-year-old has already witnessed 18,000 murders, on television and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> <b>The</b> locale of Gordon Head is the Canadian suburb where the murder happened, and where the film thus takes place.|$|R

500|$|Jean MacCurdy {{said that}} How I Spent My Vacation {{makes fun of}} summer {{vacations}} by mocking [...] "the boredom of summer {{and some of those}} horrible car trips" [...] (an issue that was first explored in National Lampoon's Vacation). [...] In the film, the Hampton family car trip is very taxing for Plucky Duck; he is disgusted by the family and is nearly killed by an escaped lunatic that the family mistakes for a hitchhiker (He happens to be a caricature of Jason Voorhees). [...] The film's fictional theme park, [...] "HappyWorldLand", is a spoof of Disneyland. The film also parodies the THX logo and Deep Note when Fowlmouth and Shirley are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater.|$|E
500|$|The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said {{he enjoyed}} {{directing}} the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are [...] "very human and real". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences {{in their own}} lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying the people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater {{was based on an}} experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two [...] "annoying" [...] women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, [...] "Now are you satisfied?", to which Groening's friend replied: [...] "I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Homer discovers his car, {{which is}} badly damaged, and is {{oblivious}} that in reality {{he and his}} friends were responsible. Chief Wiggum blindly jumps {{to the conclusion that the}} vandalism at the school is the work of kids and immediately enforces a curfew on all of Springfield's children, prohibiting them from being on the streets after sunset. Bart and Lisa, as well as the other children of Springfield, are annoyed with not being allowed out after sunset. The children soon rally together to rebel and see an old drive-in horror movie which they saw advertised on television, called [...] "The Bloodening", a film recently discovered in a concrete vault after it was deemed too violent. While <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> the movie was interrupted as they are caught by Chief Wiggum. As a punishment, the children must clean a police billboard with Wiggum on it.|$|E

500|$|Following its release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over its fictionalization of events; it was heavily criticized by African-American activists {{who were involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the families of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotted the film, stating, [...] "How long will we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put their lives on the line for equality?" [...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Matt Selman and directed by Nancy Kruse. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on January 27, 2002. The episode's setpiece was pitched by Selman, and originated from a discussion he had with current showrunner Al Jean, about [...] "how much crap there is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater before the movie actually begins." [...] The episode's plot was also pitched by Selman, who had wanted to do an [...] episode with a [...] "jaws-wired-shut plot" [...] for a while. It was not until long after the episode was completed that Selman learned that one can in fact talk [...] with one's jaw wired shut. He learned this from fellow Simpsons writer Brian Kelley, who had had his jaw wired shut once in high school. Kelley joined the writing staff during the writing stage of the episode, however {{he did not mention}} that one could talk, since {{he did not want to}} [...] "ruin" [...] the episode. However, he did say that one should eat a lot before since one will lose weight when their jaw is wired shut. These trivias were subsequently included in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Scenes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> theater were {{filmed in}} a {{recently}} closed theater in Dunbar–Southlands, British Columbia. The location featured the [...] "architectural and design {{characteristics of a}} small-town cinema situated within an appropriate neighbourhood". The movie that is being shown in the Ohio theatre which is attacked is Die Hard with a Vengeance, whose storyline of a mission by terrorists involving American banks is broadly mirrored in this episode's plot. The faux corpses were created by make-up artist Toby Lindala; when he {{brought them to the}} set, however, there was no room to store them, and so he kept them temporarily in the craft services room. A Canadian government money depository filled in for the First Sovereign Bank of Pennsylvania that is robbed in the episode. The production staff assembled more than 15,000dollar bills of various denominations—which valued somewhere near $40,000—for use during the scenes at said bank. Production initially had to stop due to the fact that, during the filming of the scene that involved the money, there was only one police guard on duty. Fearful that an actual armed robbery might have been attempted, back-up was called in and filming continued as planned.|$|E
50|$|The film depicts Beck's {{surrender}} {{of herself and}} Fernandez, but that implied demonstration of remorse {{is contrary to the}} historical record: neighbors noticed the Downings' disappearance, and Beck and Fernandez were apprehended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Downing house after returning from an evening <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{teaser trailer}} {{for the film}} was {{released}} on April 9, 2015 on Wong Fu Productions' YouTube channel.
