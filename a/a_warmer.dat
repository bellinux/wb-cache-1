5|$|By September4, {{the maximum}} winds were found {{closer to the}} center of {{circulation}} and the cyclone developed <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day, the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status. Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23mi (37km) in diameter. Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h); however, these winds were located roughly 65mi (100km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity.|$|E
50|$|Finding <b>a</b> {{definition}} for <b>warm</b> boot, however, {{is more of}} a challenge. All aforementioned sources indicate that <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> boot is initiated by pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination; all except Tulloch (2002) mention that <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> reboot does not perform POST. Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) specifies that for <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> reboot to occur, BIOS must be the recipient of the key combination. Microsoft Support article 102228 takes a more technical approach and defines <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> boot <b>a</b> result of invoking INT 19h, a BIOS interrupt call; the Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination {{is only one of the}} ways. According to Grimes (2001), malware may prevent or subvert <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> boot by intercepting Ctrl + Alt + Delete key combination and prevent it from reaching BIOS. Windows NT family of operating systems also does the same and reserves the key combination for its own use. Soper (2004) asserts that Windows restart command initiates <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> boot, thus contradicting Jones, Landes, Tittel (2002) that believes the same action performs a cold boot.|$|R

5|$|Organ {{builders}} {{began to}} lean towards specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops.

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and {{allowed him to}} move freely. In order to tell the three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, NOAA {{issued its}} first outlook {{calling for a}} near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10–16 named storms could form, {{including}} 4–8 hurricanes of which 1–4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated {{that there is a}} 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La Niña forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatologists {{measure the}} ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to {{determine}} the climate {{millions of years ago}} (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle). Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope, oxygen-16, evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12% heavier oxygen-18, and this disparity increases at lower temperatures. During periods of lower global temperatures, snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16, and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18. Marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> climate. Paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|The Hanada {{family had}} {{generally}} received very positive press coverage while Takanohana and Wakanohana were active wrestlers, {{with the press}} holding them up as the ideal Japanese family and tending to ignore any splits between them. Their different attitudes towards both sumo philosophy and the outside world had been noted, with Takanohana being regarded as somewhat aloof and reserved and Wakanahona having <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> personality. However, upon their father's death from cancer in May 2005, a bitter rift between the brothers was widely reported in the Japanese media. Takanohana felt he should be the chief mourner at the funeral as he had remained in the Sumo Association whilst his brother had left to become a TV celebrity, but the role went to Wakanohana as the elder brother, as is traditional.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} {{of what would}} become the village of Lincolnshire were Native American Potawatomi migrants from Canada and Wisconsin. The tribesmen left these northern places in the 16thcentury in search of <b>a</b> <b>warmer,</b> more temperate climate. The first Europeans to visit the area were the French Jesuit explorers Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet. Shortly after arriving in 1673 at the site of what later became Waukegan, they sailed down the Des Plaines River and made contact with the local Potawatomi, who would dominate the area by 1768. One of the Potawatomi villages that they encountered stretched along {{the west bank of the}} Des Plaines River, from what later became Illinois Route 22 south to Aptakisic Road, the first real settlement in the Lincolnshire and Half Day region.|$|E
5|$|Unveiled in 1989, the new {{lighting}} arrangement {{required the}} removal of the contour-outlining light bulbs and the installation of 176floodlights in and around the tower's frame. From dusk to midnight, the floodlights illuminate the entire tower. Sodium vapor lamps are used from 2 October to 6 July to cover the tower in an orange color. From 7 July to 1 October, the lights are changed to metal halide lamps to illuminate the tower with a white color. The reasoning behind the change is a seasonal one. Ishii reasoned that orange is <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> color and helps to offset the cold winter months. Conversely, white is thought a cool color that helps during the hot summer months.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} among the subspecies. For T. l. ludovicianus, the crown is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its rump and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater coverts are a rich brown, {{with a series of}} small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by <b>a</b> <b>warmer,</b> less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the dominant tree species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E
