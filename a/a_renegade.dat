After besting the giant moogle, the Warrior of Light encounters a white-robed Ascian named Elidibus who tests the player's might before disappearing.

In gratitude, the Doman leader, an Au Ra named Yugiri, accompanies the party to reconnoiter the Sahagin spawning grounds where their primal Leviathan is summoned.

When Max is reunited with Cale he immediately becomes ill and almost dies.

Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman, Manticore's founder. Over the course of the season, it is revealed that a millennia-old breeding cult has bred their own super-soldiers who rival the Manticore-produced transgenics. Ames White (Martin Cummins), a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics, is revealed {{to be a member of}} the cult. When a strange message written in Max's genetic code makes an appearance on her skin it is revealed that Sandeman is <b>a</b> <b>renegade</b> from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son. White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father's transgenic creations with a passion. Believing that Max is a threat to the breeding cult's plans they attempt to kill her, but she escapes to Terminal City, an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding.
