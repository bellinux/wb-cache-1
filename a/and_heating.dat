The flows of energy between the electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks through the coupling components were taken into account. In the combined analysis, two calculation techniques were developed. These were the decomposed and integrated electrical-hydraulic-thermal calculation techniques in the forms of the power flow and simple optimal dispatch. Using the combined analysis, the variables of the electrical <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> networks were calculated. The results of the decomposed and integrated calculations were very close. The comparison showed that the integrated calculation requires fewer iterations than the decomposed calculation.

As the gas flow rate increases, water <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> transfer efficiencies <b>and</b> recoveries decline due to the reduced residence time.

30|$|The {{following}} regional electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> {{supply management}} problem {{is used to}} demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} developed ITSDP model. In this study system, a decision maker is responsible for electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> to multiple users through several technologies on an annual cycle based on different pollutants emission permissible levels. Since different environmental restrictions, the decision maker would take expected electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> demand into account to make fossil and renewable resources utilization optimal, manage electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> generation <b>and</b> plan the equipment expansion. Mostly, increasing electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> demand could lead to facility expansion, fuel exploitation and energy imports. However, it is unpractical to achieve sustainable development with the ever-increasing economic and environmental costs, unlimited facility expansion and energy exploitation (Liu et al. [2000]). Thus, the problem is how to incorporate different pollutants emission reduction control levels into regional electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> planning. In this study system, planning period is on an annual cycle, with <b>heating</b> seasons <b>and</b> no <b>heating</b> seasons. Multiple energy resources/technologies need to be allocated to multiple end users. Traditional energy resources (e.g., coal, natural gas) with limited availabilities and renewable resources (e.g., wind) are utilized to meet the electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> demand. More specifically, coal and natural gas are both used for electricity generation; wind is a supplement for electricity generation; the cogeneration system of electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> is another energy-efficient way. The electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> demands during one year are affected by many uncertainties, such as the growing population, energy-transformation rate, electricity <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> prices <b>and</b> changing weather; all of those factors would produce many complicated uncertainties (Li et al. Li et al. [2006 a], [b]; Liu [2007]; Li et al. [2008]). In addition, these uncertainties are intricate because of a series of imprecise information (e.g., social, economic, environmental, seasonal and geographic conditions, energy carrier characteristics). They could only be expressed as distribution information or intervals when most data can hardly be available determinately. Once these uncertainties are determined, system costs, efficiencies and capacities of each technology could be defined.|$|R
40|$|Using a tubular ceramic {{membrane}} as the transport membrane condenser for simultaneous water <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> recovery from gaseous streams is experimentally investigated {{in the current}} study. The effects of several important operational parameters (e. g. gas flow rate, coolant flow rate, transmembrane pressure and inlet gas temperature) on the process performance in terms of mass <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> transfer across the membrane are systematically studied. It is found that mass <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> transfer rates can be enhanced by increasing the gas flow rate, coolant water flow rate and {{the temperature of the}} inlet gas stream. To improve the water <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> recovery, a low gas flow rate but a high coolant flow rate should be maintained.

However, water <b>and</b> <b>heat</b> recovery does not change significantly with the change in transmembrane pressure. 20 – 60 % water recovery and 33 – 85 % heat recovery are achievable when using cold water as the coolant.
