5000|$|Kantian {{scholars}} have long debated two contrasting {{interpretations of the}} thing-in-itself. One is the dual object view, according to which the thing-in-itself is an entity distinct from the phenomena to which it gives rise. The other is the dual <b>aspect</b> <b>view,</b> according to which the thing-in-itself and the thing-as-it-appears are two [...] "sides" [...] of the same thing. This view {{is supported by the}} textual fact that [...] "Most occurrences of the phrase 'things-in-themselves' are shorthand for the phrase, 'things considered in themselves' (Dinge an sich selbst betrachten)."Although we cannot see things apart from the way we do in fact perceive them via the physical senses, we can think them apart from our mode of sensibility (physical perception); thus making the thing-in-itself a kind of noumenon or object of thought.|$|E

Method of research from this thesis is using the method of hypothesis testing, which aims {{to determine whether there}} are differences between the financial performances of a pure Islamic bank and hybrid Islamic banks around the world. This research was conducted in 2011. The data used in this study is secondary data. The secondary data used were obtained from published financial reports of pure Islamic banks and hybrid Islamic banks published financial reports around the world as well as other sources that can support the research. The data collected were analyzed using analysis hypothesis which conducted by non-parametric statistics testing, Two Independent Sample Test: Mann-Whitney U, because the data of this research are not normally distributed.

30|$|What {{makes this}} measure robust against {{occlusion}} and clutter {{is the fact}} that if some features are missing, either in the <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> of B-Rep model or in the search image, the observed edges will lead to the random match with idle elements or noise edges, which will overall contribute to the larger distance sum. In order to obtain estimation robustness, the matched edge pairs in the bipartite graph are divided into two groups, in which one group, called the nearest edge pairs, has the nearest the minimum distances, and another has larger distances. The group with minimum distance returns the more precise correspondences between the <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> of B-Rep model and the search image, which help to pick up the edges affected not by occlusion or clutter, as detailed in Section 6.|$|E
30|$|Widespread {{industrial}} products, {{which are}} usually texture-less, are mainly represented with 3 D boundary representation (B-Rep) model for designing and manufacturing, hence the pose estimation of texture-less object based on B-Rep model is worthy of much studying in industrial inspection. In view of such facts that surfaces are much crucial both to construction of B-Rep model and to recognition of real object, {{the edges of the}} visible surfaces in each <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> of B-Rep model are computed and the edges in a search image containing real B-Rep objects are extracted with modified Hough algorithm. Secondly, the two edge sets are converted into the metric space for comparison, where each edge is expressed with the tetrad of edge length, angle of middle point, angle of perpendicular axis, and length of perpendicular axis. In that way, the pose of real B-Rep object in a search image is estimated by comparing the edge set of every <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> with the edge set of the search image with the bipartite graph matching algorithm. The corresponding experiment was taken with some products in national design reservoir (NDR), and it verified the effectiveness of the texture-less pose estimation approach based on B-Rep model.|$|E
40|$|This article {{responds}} to Ingmar Persson’s article “Internal or External Grounds for the Nontransitivity of ‘Better/Worse than’”. In his article, Persson argues {{in favor of}} an account of supervenience that would be compatible with both an Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View,</b> and the nontransitivity of the “better or worse than” relations. This article points out that the Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View</b> that Persson favors would fail to capture many features of practical reasoning that most advocates of an Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View</b> favor, and that the version of the Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View</b> that I discuss in Rethinking the Good does capture. I note, however, that Persson’s view would not only be compatible with my book’s main claims and arguments, it would substantially buttress my results. Accordingly, I would welcome it if Persson could successfully develop and defend his view. Unfortunately, however, my article raises a number of worries about Persson’s view. I consider various different ways of understanding Persson’s position, and argue that none of them ultimately succeed in establishing a plausible version of a genuinely Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View</b> that would be compatible with the nontransitivity of the “better or worse than” relations. I acknowledge that if Persson can ultimately make good on his claims, he will have made a substantial contribution {{to our understanding of the}} good and the nature of ideals. However, as matters now stand, I am not moved by his arguments to revise the claims I made in Rethinking the Good, correlating the nontransitivity of the “better or worse than” relations with the Essentially Comparative View, rather than the Internal <b>Aspects</b> <b>View...</b>|$|R

30|$|Texture-less {{industrial}} products are represented as B-Rep model in designing and manufacturing. In the paper, {{the edges and}} surfaces of B-Rep model are selected from STEP files, the <b>aspect</b> <b>views</b> of B-Rep model are obtained according to projection transformation, and the edge sets of <b>aspect</b> <b>views</b> as the accurate references are represented in the metric space. Similarly, the edges are detected from the search image containing B-Rep object according to Hough transformation, and the edge set is also represented in the metric space. The poses of texture-less industrial object is estimated by matching the bipartite graph of the two edge sets from the search image and the <b>aspect</b> <b>views.</b> It is confirmed that our approach is feasible, though {{there are still some}} problems to be solved.

30|$|Meanwhile, the {{bipartite graph}} {{matching}} algorithm, itself rotation invariant, {{is used in}} the tetrad metric space to compare the two edge sets from the aspect views of B-Rep model and the search image. Furthermore, the two sets need also be normalized beforehand in the metric space for translation and scale invariance. For simple calculation, the curve edges of surface boundary in B-Rep model are segmented and approximated as a series of line sections. While surfaces in 3 D B-Rep model are projected into 2 D views, each <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> is consisted of the line sections represented with the tetrads. At mean time, the edge tetrads are extracted and converted from the search image with image processing algorithms such as the combination of Canny Operator and Hough transformation.|$|E
30|$|The {{matching}} {{accuracy is}} affected by some parameters. The edge number of an <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> is usually less than the search image, {{and it is difficult}} to specify the distance between the inserted empty elements and an edge. At initial stage, the empty distance is equal to the maximum in the distance matrix; however, if the specified distance value is too high, some matches with the minimum distance may be overridden. The occlusion problem is similar to the empty distance due to the loss of some inherent points in the search image. In the case of occlusion, the range about the minimum distance in the nearest edge pairs needs to be evaluated. Likewise, the aforementioned threshold in the nearest neighbor clustering need be specified based on experience to merge better.|$|E

The data was focused using subapertures in a step of 1. 5 °, each SAR image representing the scene from a slightly different aspect. The potential of non-coherent fusion of full aspect coverage to reveal small targets was demonstrated. By a manual selection of the viewing angle, parking cars next to high buildings could be revealed and a full view on selected targets with reduced shadow and overlay effects was shown. We studied the effect of varying aspects on the focused image pixels and developed a first metric to automatically select the best viewing angle to a local scene. Areas containing ground information like grass or asphalt and which are not hidden between high objects could be identified and used to deliver a good <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> on neighboring areas which suffer from shadowing effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{everyday}} {{understanding of}} space may be self-evident and unproblematic. However, {{as soon as}} we are asked for a formal definition, e. g. in the context of building classification or product modelling, the concept of space is subject of controversy and misunderstanding. To some, space is the emptiness in which things are embedded, i. e. something immaterial. To others, space has no separate existence but is a property of the material world. Still, according to both views, space can be experienced. In this paper we analyse some influential work within building classification and building product modelling and criticise these for applying a concept of space without factual reference. We explore the ontological foundations for the concept of space, and conclude that space is an <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> on things, depending on the view, it may be seen both as a property of things and as a thing in itself.

30|$|In this paper, {{we first}} {{set up the}} metric space about edges in order to compare the edges from aspect views of B-Rep model and the search image, and propose an {{algorithm}} about the pose estimation of texture-less object in the search image based on B-Rep model. In view that surfaces are as the crucial visual and functional features from ecological psychology and affordance theory [5], moreover, considering that surfaces are also the core elements in B-Rep model, surfaces are first extracted from the neutral STEP file of B-Rep model, and then the edges of surface boundary are picked up to constitute the feature set of B-Rep model. Secondly, when the B-Rep model is projected to generate a number of aspect views {{that make up an}} aspect graph, the edge sets from each <b>aspect</b> <b>view</b> that correspond to certain pose parameters are computed for next matching. In the same way, the edges in the search image containing real B-Rep object are detected and merged according to contiguity and continuity rule, and then the search image is characterized into the edge set. Now the object pose can be estimated by matching the bipartite graph of two edge sets from the search image and one of aspect views of B-Rep model.|$|E
