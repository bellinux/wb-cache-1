Completed in 1935, the dam created Madden Lake (later Alajeula Lake) which provides additional water storage for the canal. In 1939, construction began on a further major improvement: a new set of locks for the canal, large enough to carry the larger warships that the United States was building at the time and planned to continue building.

40|$|Vortex drop shafts {{are used}} in urban {{drainage}} systems to connect two sewers located at considerably different elevations {{by means of a}} vertical conduit. The vortex drop shaft was first designed by Drioli (1947). It was then studied by other authors with reference to subcritical approach flow. Vortex shafts specifically conceived for supercritical flow can also be used, but at very high costs due to the special features required for the intake structure. The present study shows the experimental results of a specific investigation into the changes {{to be made in the}} <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> for supercritical flow, when a subcritical vortex intake is used. The proposals concern the definition of the height of the step to be located in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel,</b> and the length of the lower-bottomed section in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel,</b> while maximizing the hydraulic efficiency of the system.

40|$|The {{shape of}} an ogee {{spillway}} {{is based on the}} shape of the lower nappe of water flowing over an aerated sharp-crested weir. At the design discharge, this shape minimises the possibility of sub-atmospheric pressure occurring on the spillway and maximises the discharge across the spillway. The formulae that are currently in use to approximate the ogee profile consider only two-dimensional flow parameters, being the depth of flow over the spillway crest, the inclination of the upstream wall face, and the pool depth upstream of the spillway. The current formulae for the ogee shape, does not consider the influence of three-dimensional flow. The most significant three-dimensional flow parameters that could affect the shape of the lower nappe are the flow velocity distribution upstream of the spillway, the orientation or angle of the water approaching the spillway, the asymmetrical cross-section of the <b>approach</b> <b>channel,</b> and the curvature of the dam wall. This paper reflects the influence of asymmetrical flow in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel.</b> The investigation was based on a physical model constructed at the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS). The inclination of the model’s sidewalls of the upstream <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> was varied to cause a change in the symmetricity, while the lower nappe profile was routinely measured. It was found that the flow in the asymmetrical <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> caused a variation from the theoretical estimated ogee profile. A comparison between the measured nappe profile and the currently used formulae was investigated. It can be concluded that the symmetricity of the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> influences the shape of the bottom nappe, which differs from the shape as proposed by the current ogee formulae. It is recommended that three-dimensional flow should be examined when designing an ogee spillway. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature of {{sediment}}s {{and the role of}} tides, currents, waves and winds in driving sediment transport on the intertidal flats and shallow subtidal areas in the vicinity of Pine Harbour Marina which is situated in a shallow embayment adjoining Tamaki Strait in Hauraki Gulf, northeast North Island, New Zealand. The results from these investigations along with the study of the marina <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> and dredge spoil dump site are used to examine the causes of sediment infilling the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to the marina. This work was undertaken in support of two resource consents (W 9205 and W 9258) granted to Pine Harbour Marina by the Auckland Regional Council to undertake maintenance dredging to excavate 4, 500 m 3 of sediment from the navigation <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> between June and October 1994. The sediments of the intertidal and shallow subtidal regions in the vicinity of Pine Harbour Marina were characterised and sediment mixing depths and transport patterns investigated with sedimentation rods, tracer studies, beach surveys and hydrographic surveys. The forcing processes of tide, wave, current and wind in the embayment were also investigated with hydrodynamic monitoring and a wave generation model for fetch limited environments was used to hind cast wave conditions. The data was collected, in conjunction with a monitoring program of the physical impacts of the 1994 dredging, to identify sediment transport pathways and to obtain quantitative sediment volume changes over the intertidal and subtidal channel areas. Pine Harbour Marina is situated in a fetch limited low wave energy environment, dominated by local wind generated waves. Wave generation model WGEN 3 DD for limited fetches, was set up to hind cast wave conditions from wind data recorded at the site. The wave climate is characterised by wave heights (Hₛ) between 0. 1 m to 0. 4 m, and wave periods (Tₛ) between 1. 0 and 2. 0 s. Large wave events are rare, but wave heights (Hₛ) up to 0. 5 m and periods (Tₛ) of 2. 5 s are generated by wind speeds greater than 10 m/s from the northwest where fetch is greatest. Wind driven circulation is important over the shallow intertidal region. On a day-to-day basis suspended sediment is transported north driven by the prevailing south-westerly winds. However large infrequent storms from the north have a greater impact on sediment transport over short time periods where significant volumes of sediment are entrained beneath high energy waves. Greater sediment transport occurs over the intertidal region than the subtidal region because sediment threshold velocities are more frequently exceeded in the shallower water depths. Thus sediment deposited in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to Pine Harbour Marina is infrequently entrained as wave orbital velocities are attenuated before they reach the bed in the deeper water. A sediment tracer experiment was undertaken using artificial fluorescent particles to identify the pattern of fine grained sediment dispersion over the intertidal flats. The dominant sediment transport direction detected was towards the southeast during a westerly storm, and a significant concentration of tracer particles accumulated in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel.</b> Sediment depth of disturbance rods on the intertidal flats indicate that sediment mixing depths were generally less than 1. 5 cm due to shallow disturbance created the movement of small (h = 1. 0 - 1. 5 cm) wave ripples. Depth of sediment disturbance increased to between 2. 0 and 3. 0 cm associated with storm periods. The maximum sediment mixing depth recorded by sedimentation rods was 6. 2 cm. Similar mixing depths of 2. 5 cm were recorded during mixing depth experiments involving short cores through buried dyed sediment and vertical mixing of fluorescent tracer particles. Fluorescent tracer was mixed to a maximum depth of 17 cm, which was not attributed to wave action but rather to bioturbation. Six monthly beach surveys indicated 2. 5 cm of accretion occurred over the mid tide region on the northern intertidal flats. This volume of sediment accretion accounts for approximately half of the dredgings material dumped on the intertidal flats. The remaining dumped sediment was resuspended by wave action and either transported back into the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> to Pine Harbour Marina, or removed from the area in suspension. Within 9 months of dredging of the <b>approach</b> <b>channel,</b> an average of 0. 5 m of sediment deposition occurred along the northern side of the landward 700 m of <b>approach</b> <b>channel.</b> This was estimated to be approximately 5, 250 m³ ± 2, 100 m³ of sediment infilling the channel. The increased rate of sediment infilling the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> is attributed to natural sediment accumulation combined with the rapid transportation of some dredgings sediment back into the channel. Initially dredgings sediment appeared to consolidate in situ, but became dispersed as a shallow layer extending up to 100 m over the intertidal flats north of the <b>approach</b> <b>channel.</b> Over the course of the investigation the dredge mounds were observed to be eroded by small drainage channels which became incised into the silty sediment at various locations transporting fine sediment from the dredge mound and intertidal flats into the <b>approach</b> <b>channel.</b> Some 12 months after dredging, the dredge mounds were dissipated and only remnant blocks of gravel to boulder sized fragments of bed rock were left. This investigation has shown that a significant amount of dredge spoil deposited on the northern intertidal flats during the 1994 dredging operation became transported back into the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> within 9 months of the completion of the dredging works. An alternate disposal site for future maintenance dredging works in the <b>approach</b> <b>channel</b> at a further distance from the channel edge would reduce the likelihood of "recycling" of dredged material. Possible alternate disposal options for management of dredge spoil from future maintenance dredging could include: sidecasting disposal further from the channel; offshore disposal site - adjacent or distant; contained disposal; or landfill...|$|R
