The paper focuses on the question whether the {{system of checks and}} controls in the Polish legislative <b>system</b> is <b>adequate</b> to secure the appropriate level of monitoring of direct payments to land required in Community law. The paper is also an attempt to diagnose the difficulties encountered by Polish organs which are responsible for proper monitoring of the spending of Community funds. The paper ends with a conclusion that the management and the audit/ control systems are not integrated, and as a result there is no control over the management of direct payments to land in Poland...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the use and effect of a role-playing game on learners’ ability in information <b>systems</b> <b>audit.</b> The study is based on experimental research. Information <b>systems</b> control and <b>audit</b> case study and video had been developed. A total of 75 graduate students undertaking a Master’s degree in accounting participated in the experiment. The findings suggested that the role-playing game did enhance participants’ perceived knowledgeability, perceived ability to perform actual tasks, and perceived enjoyment of learning. However,  learning only occurred if the lecturer {{was involved in the}} game. The lecturer had to instruct and provide guidelines to students to perform information <b>systems</b> <b>audit</b> throughout the game.

40|$|The {{turnover}} rate of Information Systems auditors is an emerging {{problem for the}} profession. In his study of factors affecting resource allocations to Information <b>Systems</b> <b>Audit</b> departments, Lucy [Lucy, R. F. Factors affecting information <b>systems</b> <b>audit</b> resource allocation decisions. Thesis, The University of Texas, Arlington, 1998. ] found that the average Information Systems (IS) auditor has four years of IS Audit experience. Dunmore [Dunmore D. B. Farewell to the information <b>systems</b> <b>audit</b> profession. Internal Auditor 1989; February: 42 – 48. ] argues that this high turnover of IS auditors will limit <b>systems</b> <b>audit</b> knowledge. Unlike prior research investigating turnover intentions of IS auditors, this study specifically includes factors that reflect the higher level needs of IS audit professionals. The need to satisfy personal and professional growth exerts a particularly strong influence on IS auditors 2 ̆ 7 turnover intentions. Further, our study confirms that IS auditors 2 ̆ 7 share similar characteristics to other IS professionals rather than with general accountants and auditors. Organizations wanting to retain their IS auditors should provide regular opportunities for their IS auditors to satisfy their personal growth needs...|$|R
