Many metals <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> lead {{in some of}} these aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores. Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.|$|E

He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's and all telepathic-based abilities. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information on Cerebro, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to perform an {{evidence}} based review for treatment of unicameral bone cysts. A search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2009) was conducted and the studies were classified according to levels of evidence. This review includes only comparative Level I-III studies. The systematic review identified 16 studies. There is one level I study, one level II study and the remaining 14 studies are level III. Seven of the sixteen studies had statistically different results: three studies indicated that steroid injection <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> bone marrow injection or curettage and bone grafting; one study indicated that cannulated screws <b>were</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> steroid injections; one study indicated resection and myoplasty <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> steroid injection; one study indicated a combination of steroid, demineralized bone matrix and bone marrow aspirate, and curettage and bone grafting <b>were</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> steroid injection; and one study indicated that curettage and bone grafting <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> non-operative immobilization. Based on one Level I study, including a limited number of individuals, steroid injection seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> bone marrow injection. As steroid injections have already demonstrated superiority over bone marrow injections in a randomized clinical trial, the next step would be a prospective trial comparing steroid injections with other treatments...|$|R

30|$|Consider the {{following}} three cases: First, the conditional mean regression shows that State I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> State II and that proposition is correct directly. Second, the quantile regression shows that state I <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> state II, and the proposition is correct. Thirdly, the conditional mean regression shows that State III <b>is</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> State II and the quantile regression shows that State I is better than State III. One can then conclude that State I is better than State II. As a result, the proposition holds through the transitivity.|$|R

25|$|Cultural {{racism is}} a term used to {{describe}} and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It {{can be defined as}} societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with xenophobia, which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an outgroup by members of an ingroup.|$|E
25|$|Both the EPQ and Big Five {{approaches}} extensively use self-report questionnaires.

The five factor model in particular {{has been criticized for}} losing the orthogonal structure between factors. Hans Eysenck has argued that fewer factors <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> a larger number of partly related ones. Although these two approaches are comparable because of the use of factor analysis to construct hierarchical taxonomies, they differ in the organization and number of factors.|$|E
25|$|The skin {{between the}} nasal dorsum and the medial canthal tendon is uniquely suited to healing by {{secondary}} intention; the outcomes often <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> what is achieved with either skin grafts or skin-flaps and tissue-flaps. Because the medial canthal tendon is {{affixed to the}} facial bone, it readily resists the forces of wound contracture; moreover, the animation (movement) of the medial brow also lends resistance to the forces of wound contracture. Furthermore, the medial canthal region is aesthetically hidden by {{the shadows of the}} nasal dorsum and of the supraorbital rim, thereby obscuring any differences in the quality of the color and of the texture of the replacement skin (epithelium).|$|E

The piece concerns a princess who founds a women's university and teaches that women <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> men and should rule in their stead.

25|$|Vactrols {{have been}} used as {{remote-controlled}} resistors for precise ground termination of Beverage and Ewe type antennae. In a typical ham radio setup, the vactrol is placed in the termination box at the farthest point of the antenna. The LDR modifies total resistance between antenna and ground (termination resistance); the operator fine-tunes this resistor from his radio shack by varying the vactrol's LED or bulb current with a potentiometer. Tuning with vactrols improves directional cardioid pattern of the antenna. According to Connelly, vactrols <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> traditional resistors in this function. In this simple layout, the LED or bulb of the vactrol is prone to damage by voltage surges induced by lightning, and must be protected by a pair of neon lamps acting as gas dischargers.|$|E
25|$|The {{reputation}} of the author was confirmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of Hope Leslie, the most decided favourite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterward, that {{in the opinion of}} some of the critics <b>are</b> <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> either Redwood or Hope Leslie. But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became firmly associated in the public mind with the rising form of a native literature. It was not only read with satisfaction but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national pride. Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals, Clarence, a Tale of our Own Times appearing in 1830.|$|E
