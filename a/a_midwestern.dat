5|$|Riley's chief legacy was his {{influence}} in fostering {{the creation of}} <b>a</b> <b>midwestern</b> cultural identity and his contributions to the Golden Age of Indiana Literature. Along with other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children.|$|E

25|$|Indianapolis survived {{financial}} challenges {{during the}} last half of nineteenth century to become a prominent railroad hub, food processor, and <b>a</b> <b>Midwestern</b> manufacturing and industrial center. By 1900 Indianapolis was at a crossroads. It had grown from a small, agricultural town into a prominent industrial city in the Midwest, but Indianapolis continued to face several challenges such as low wages for many of its workers, industrial pollution, gender and minority discrimination, and limited local capital for further development.|$|E

25|$|After the winless 1916 {{season the}} Gators hired Al Buser, a former All-American lineman for the Wisconsin Badgers, who promised to use <b>a</b> <b>Midwestern,</b> power-football {{style of play}} to revive the team.

25|$|During the Great Depression, popcorn {{was fairly}} {{inexpensive}} at 5–10 cents {{a bag and}} became popular. Thus, while other businesses failed, the popcorn business thrived and became a {{source of income for}} many struggling farmers, including the Redenbacher family, namesake of the famous popcorn brand. During World War II, sugar rations diminished candy production, and Americans compensated by eating three times as much popcorn as they had before. The snack was popular at theaters, much to the initial displeasure of many of the theater owners, who thought it distracted from the films. Their minds eventually changed, however, and in 1938 <b>a</b> <b>Midwestern</b> theater owner named Glen W. Dickson installed popcorn machines in the lobbies of his theaters. The venture was a financial success, and the trend soon spread.|$|E

25|$|Iowa was {{won by the}} Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, by a 9.54% {{margin of}} victory.

Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise considered as a safe blue state. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush had very narrowly won Iowa in his re-election bid, although prior to that the state had gone Democratic for four elections straight. <b>A</b> <b>Midwestern</b> state where agriculture plays {{a critical role in}} the daily lives of its citizens, Iowa is nevertheless an independent state. However, due to Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses, Bush's unpopularity, and the troubling economy, the state easily fell into Obama's column later in the election season.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in <b>a</b> <b>midwestern</b> university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E
