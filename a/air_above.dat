5|$|Lake-effect snow is {{produced}} during cooler atmospheric conditions when a {{cold air mass}} moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder <b>air</b> <b>above,</b> freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.|$|E
5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot <b>air</b> <b>above</b> the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Airs</b> <b>Above</b> the Ground is a {{novel by}} Mary Stewart, first {{published}} in 1965. The title derives from Classical dressage, in particular, the graceful <b>Airs</b> <b>Above</b> the Ground, the haute ecole movements for which special breeds of horses, in particular Lippizans, are highly trained. These trained moves were once used by the horse to aid mounted soldiers in battle.|$|R

5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder <b>air</b> <b>above</b> it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E
5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the <b>air</b> <b>above</b> it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E
5|$|Phát was {{supposed}} to seize the second largest {{air force base in}} the country, located in the satellite city of Biên Hòa outside Saigon. This was to prevent Kỳ from mobilizing air power against them, but this failed, as Kỳ had already flown there to take control after dropping Khánh off at Vũng Tàu. Phát could not challenge Kỳ's fighter planes, which were already patrolling the <b>air</b> <b>above</b> Biên Hòa by the time they arrived. Kỳ flew a short distance southwest and circled Tân Sơn Nhất, threatening to bomb the rebels. Kỳ had never trusted Thảo or Phát, and did not want them in power. Most of the forces of the III and IV Corps surrounding the capital disliked both Khánh and the rebels, and took no action. As nightfall came, it appeared that forces loyal to Khánh were strengthening as they began to move towards Saigon.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in the Field, {{commanded}} by Sir David Henderson consisted of five squadrons—one observation balloon squadron (RFC No 1 Squadron) and four aeroplane squadrons (Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5). These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914, but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again, it only became effective the following year. In August 1915, General Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson. The British use of air power evolved during the war, from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the <b>air</b> <b>above</b> the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line. The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals; in April 1917, (known as Bloody April), the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft. Not until late 1917, with the introduction of the Sopwith Camel and the S.E.5, were they able to compete successfully for control of the air.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{differences}} in the specific heat capacity of land and water, continents heat up faster than seas. Consequently, the <b>air</b> <b>above</b> coastal lands heats up faster than the <b>air</b> <b>above</b> seas. This creates areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as sea breeze.|$|E

25|$|When {{blending}} {{mixes with}} pressures {{up to about}} , the Ideal gas law provides a reasonable approximation and simple equations {{can be used to}} calculate the pressures of each component gas needed to create the mix.
