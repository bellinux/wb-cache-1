500|$|He was a cricket enthusiast, {{taking his}} bat {{with him when}} {{evacuated}} during the Blitz. In 1971, he told Mel Gussow: [...] "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time." [...] He {{was chairman of the}} Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of Yorkshire Cricket Club, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by Sarah Lyall, writing in The New York Times: [...] "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." [...] Pinter approved of the [...] "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." [...] After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. [...] The BBC Radio 4 memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.|$|E
500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies. [...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. I think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps predictably for a psych track, 'It's Working' is {{also about}} drugs. What's more curious, however, is that <b>it's</b> not <b>about</b> LSD. <b>It's</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> ecstasy the boys regret gobbling up in the early throes of their success." ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 2017, Linehan {{said that}} the musical would draw {{inspiration}} from The Book of Mormon, and would [...] "go for the jugular ... {{you get all the}} things people loved <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> innocence and all the sweetness, but introduce a harder edge". Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would need to focus on a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E
