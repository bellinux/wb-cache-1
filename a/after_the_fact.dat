5|$|In 1659, {{shortly before}} the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, the Protector's Council was abolished. Charles II restored the Royal Privy Council, but he, like previous Stuart monarchs, chose to rely on a small group of advisers. Under George I even more power transferred to this committee.

A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find credible evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Goebbels {{used his}} {{propaganda}} ministry and the Reich chambers to control {{access to information}} domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals {{for the remainder of}} the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Corzine, and {{managers}} including Bradley Abelow and Henri Steenkamp, appealed a court ruling relating to repayments to customers of the bankrupt brokerage. A spokesman for Mr. Corzine {{made clear that}} the appeal was not an attempt to delay payments to customers, but due to a disagreement regarding how those claims would be handled by the trustee after they were paid. Mr. Corzine fully supported customers receiving 100 percent of their money and had no desire for this to be delayed. There was nothing preventing the trustee from making full distributions immediately and litigating the appeal <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> Ultimately all customers were paid in full.|$|E

Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{believe that}} Caragiale's ultimate relocation to Germany {{was at least}} in part prompted by the Caion affair. This was notably suggested by Caragiale's actor friend, Ion Brezeanu. Moreover, literary rivals as well as third parties have noted that Caion's calumnies shed focus from his own dubious creative methods. In his speech of 1902, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea openly accused Caion of forging historical records during his stint at Noua Revistă Română. More than fifty years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> Ștefan Cazimir discovered that the poems Caion claimed to have authored, and which Caragiale found especially entertaining, were in fact poor-quality translations from Charles Baudelaire.|$|E

50|$|When a very {{important}} event happens, TVN broadcasts {{a special edition of}} <b>The</b> <b>Facts</b> in order to provide full coverage of the topic. Depending on the importance of the event, the whole program can be dedicated to the topic or half of it. When it is presented from the studio, the presenter usually stands in front of a video wall. When an event occurs at weekend, the main program is presented by a male presenter, while a female presenter continues the coverage on <b>The</b> <b>Facts</b> <b>After</b> <b>The</b> <b>Facts</b> on TVN24. In some cases, the program is presented from the scene of the event and is completely dedicated to the topic.|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{a formal}} opinion by the Attorney General {{concluded}} that resignation from Congress does not free a member {{to be appointed}} to civil office because the Clause speaks to the term for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment {{to the position of}} United States Tariff Commissioner. In 1896, the Comptroller of the Treasury determined, <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> that former Senator Matthew Ransom's appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on May 3, 2006, The New York Times addressed the controversy. The paper acknowledged that the mainstream media—itself included—had been criticized for focusing on Bush's act with Bridges while ignoring Colbert's speech. The paper then quoted several passages of Colbert's more substantial criticism {{of the president and}} discussed various reactions to the event. On May 15, The New York Times public editor, Byron Calame, wrote on his blog that more than two hundred readers had written to complain about the exclusion of any mention of Colbert from the paper's initial lengthy article covering the dinner. Calame quoted his deputy bureau chief in Washington, who said that a mention of Colbert in the first article could not have been long enough to do his routine justice. But he also noted that the paper should have printed an in-depth article specifically covering Colbert's speech in the same issue, rather than waiting until days <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E

5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was {{an effort}} by the CIA to analyze {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|RKO {{has long}} been celebrated for its series of musicals {{starring}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the mid-to-late 1930s. Actors Katharine Hepburn and, later, Robert Mitchum had their first major successes at the studio. Cary Grant was a mainstay for years. The work of producer Val Lewton's low-budget horror unit and RKO's many ventures into the field now known as film noir have been acclaimed, largely <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> by film critics and historians. The studio produced {{two of the most}} famous films in motion picture history: King Kong and Citizen Kane. RKO was also known for being the distributor to a significant portion of Walt Disney's animated feature films, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 to Peter Pan in 1953.|$|E

Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker.
