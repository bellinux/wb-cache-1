However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very easy for me to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately {{wanted to be in the}} big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, you heard the producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut out anyway, I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... Suddenly I came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came back from that and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E
