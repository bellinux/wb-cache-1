40|$|Abstract: Tidal {{energy has}} been used since Roman times, {{although}} the use of tidal currents as a possible industrial energy source is a more modern concept. Unlike wind power, however, {{there is still no}} consensus on the most appropriate technology for resource exploitation. Similarities with wind power can cause errors of interpretation, especially when attempting to assess resource potential. The energy availability esti-mates that have been produced have, until now, only taken account of the <b>apparent</b> <b>current</b> flow speeds before the extraction of energy. As demonstrated in this paper, this may not be appropriate, especially for large energy extraction rates, which alter the underlying hydraulic nature of the flow environment. In a simple hypothetical channel linking two infinite oceans, a maximum extraction of 10 per cent of the apparent raw kinetic flux would appear to be acceptable. The limitations on sea loch type environments may, how-ever, be less restrictive...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of searching biomedical literature for drug interaction and side-effects is <b>apparent.</b> <b>Current</b> digital libraries (e. g., PubMed) suffer infrequent tagging and metadata annotation updates. Such limitations cause absence of linking literature to new scientific evidence. This demonstrates {{a great deal}} of challenges that {{stand in the way of}} scientists when searching biomedical repositories. In this paper, we present a network mining approach that provides a bridge for linking and searching drug-related literature. Our contributions here are two fold: (1) an efficient algorithm called HashPairMiner to address the run-time complexity issues demonstrated in its predecessor algorithm: HashnetMiner, and (2) a database of discoveries hosted on the web to facilitate literature search using the results produced by HashPairMiner. Though the K-H network model and the HashPairMiner algorithm are fairly young, their outcome is evidence of the considerable promise they offer to the biomedical science community in general and the drug research community in particular...|$|E

40|$|This chapter assesses how the European {{economy is}} likely to fare under the fiscal {{constraints}} associated with EMU. The adverse growth effects of much current public spending may provide a rationale for why EU governments view these fiscal constraints so benignly. The longer-term consequences for infrastructural spending and the funding of pension reform present dangers however. To {{the extent to which}} the “new view ” of fiscal stabilisation is read as an indication that fiscal consolidation can be effected without adverse short-term consequences, this paper argues that this too is overoptimistic; the Stability Pact {{is likely to}} cause short-term as well as long-term problems.

Few instructors are satisfied with the text: “It covers too many topics, it does them in the wrong order, it doesn’t do things in the way I like. ” Few students actually read the text.

And finally, an upcoming generation of students seems much more comfortable with obtaining their information on-line, often with active game-like components and video.

40|$|The anodic {{oxidation}} of aqueous solutions containing dimethyl phthalate (DMP) up to 125 mg/L with sodium sulfate (Na(2) SO(4)) as supporting electrolyte within the pH range 2. 0 - 10. 0 was studied using a one-compartment batch reactor employing a boron-doped diamond (BDD) as anode. Electrolyses {{were carried out}} at constant current density (1. 5 - 4. 5 mA/cm(2)). Complete mineralization was always achieved owing to the great concentration of hydroxyl radical (-OH) generated at the BDD surface. The effects of pH, <b>apparent</b> <b>current</b> density and initial DMP concentration on the degradation rate of DMP, the specific charge required for its total mineralization and mineralization current efficiency were investigated systematically. The mineralization rate of DMP {{was found to be}} pH-independent and to increase with increasing applied current density. Results indicated that this electrochemical process was subjected, at least partially, to the mass transfer of organics onto the BDD surface. Kinetic analysis of the temporal change of DMP concentration during electrolysis determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) revealed that DMP decay under all tested conditions followed a pseudo first-order reaction. Aromatic intermediates and generated carboxylic acids were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and a general pathway for the electrochemical incineration of DMP on BDD was proposed...|$|E

Time series obtained at a sampling rate of 100 kHz (filter 25 kHz) were analyzed by three methods {{to find out whether}} the AMFE results from an effect on gating or on the conductivity of the open state. Fitting the amplitude histograms by a superposition of gaussians showed a broadening in the presence of Tl(+). Dwell-time analysis based on an O-O-C-C-C model failed to evaluate rate constants above the filter frequency. Thus, the absence of any reduction of <b>apparent</b> open-channel <b>current</b> in time series simulated with the evaluated rate constants could not be taken as evidence against the hypothesis of gating. Finally, a direct fit of the measured time series using five different 5 -state Hidden Markov models revealed that the presence of Tl(+) changed the rate constants {{in such a way that}} the number of transitions into the short-lived open state (30 micros) increased strongly compared to those in the absence of Tl(+).

40|$|Daugaard Jensen Gletscher, Greenland, {{is a large}} tidewater glacier {{terminating}} in {{the northwest}} corner of the Scoresby Sund fjords. We present a time series of surface flow speeds spanning 1985 - 2010 based on feature tracking of satellite images. The time series confirms that flow speeds remained stable and reveals a persistent summer acceleration of up to 10 % over the lower 10 km of the glacier. The front of the 6 km floating tongue fluctuates by little more than the average size of calved icebergs, 1 km. While we are unable to detect any imbalance between ice discharge and surface mass balance within our error estimates, observations suggest that the region is losing mass and experiencing decreases in surface elevation. We conclude that as flow speeds and surface mass balance have remained steady since 1985, the shift from balance to imbalance, leading to elevation decrease, must have occurred prior to this date. As for other stable Greenland tidewater glaciers, the seasonal melt cycle is the dominant influence on flow velocity variation but, if the <b>apparent</b> <b>current</b> thinning rates continue, there is potential for the grounding line to retreat, for calving rates to increase and for the glacier to accelerate...|$|E

40|$|The {{degradation}} of 4 -chiorophenol in acidic solution of pH — 3. 5 {{has been studied}} by different electrochemical meth-ods involving 11202 electrogeneration from an 02 -diffusion cathode. While the solution is slowly mineralized by anodic oxidation {{in the presence of}} 11202, the rate for organic carbon removal increases notably by electro-Fenton, photoelectro-Fenton, and peroxi-coagulation, where Fe 2 acts as catalyst to produce oxidizing 0 H from electrogenerated H 202. A com-plete mineralization was only reached in the photoelectro-Fenton process. For peroxi-coagulation, the removal of organ-ic carbon in solution is mainly due to the coagulation of dechlorinated intermediates with the Fe(OH) 3 precipitate formed. The decay for substrate concentration is faster by electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton than by peroxi-coagulation. In all methods, the initial hydroxylated intermediate is 4 -chloro- 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene, which is further oxidized with loss of chloride ion to yield maleic and fumaric acids. Fe 3 complexes are produced in the processes using iron ions. These complexes are slowly mineralized by electro-Fenton and rapidly photodecomposed to CO 2 by photoelectro-Fenton processes.
