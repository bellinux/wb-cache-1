5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve.</b> As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor innervation to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E

5|$|The <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is derived}} from the basal plate of the {{embryonic}} spinal segments C1â€“C6.|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{originate}} solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper {{segments}} of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> is derived.|$|E

5|$|The <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> is a {{cranial nerve}} that {{supplies}} the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves, or simply cranial nerve XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|The <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{is tested}} by {{evaluating}} {{the function of}} the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve.</b> Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> is {{described}} as having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|Injury to the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{can result}} in neck pain and {{weakness}} of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve {{can result in}} shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and facial nerve, which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Many {{important}} structures {{relate to}} the sternocleidomastoid, including the common carotid artery, <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve,</b> and brachial plexus.|$|E
25|$|The sternocleidomastoid is {{innervated by}} the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> {{of the same}} side. It {{supplies}} only motor fibres. The cervical plexus supplies sensation, including proprioception, via the ventral primary rami of C2 and C3.|$|E

50|$|The {{upper surface}} of the lateral part {{presents}} an oval eminence, the jugular tubercle, which overlies the hypoglossal canal and is sometimes crossed by an oblique groove for the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and <b>accessory</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|At its origin, it {{is covered}} by the {{posterior}} belly of the digastricus and the stylohyoideus, and the hypoglossal nerve winds around it from behind forward; higher up, it crosses the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the vagus and <b>accessory</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
25|$|The sternocleidomastoid {{is within}} the {{investing}} fascia of the neck, along with the trapezius muscle, with which it shares its nerve supply (the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve).</b> It is thick and thus serves as a primary landmark of the neck, as it divides the neck into anterior and posterior cervical triangles (in front and behind the muscle, respectively) which helps define the location of structures, such as the lymph nodes for the head and neck.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (vestibulocochlear nerve), swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (<b>accessory</b> <b>nerve)</b> or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
500|$|Traditional {{descriptions}} of the <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> divide it into a spinal part and a cranial part. The cranial component rapidly joins the vagus nerve, and there is ongoing debate about whether the cranial part should be {{considered part of the}} <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve</b> proper. Consequently, the term [...] "accessory nerve" [...] usually refers only to nerve supplying the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, also called the spinal <b>accessory</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most {{often it}} is {{a branch of the}} nerve to the subclavius and may contain {{numerous}} phrenic nerve fibers.
