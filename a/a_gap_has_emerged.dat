40|$|Small-scale steel {{manufacturers}} in high-cost countries cannot compete by producing standardized products at lowest cost. Thus, these actors have developed marketing strategies based on increased customer orientation, where niche markets {{accounts for a}} greater share of sales. As a consequence sales are derived from a larger number of products, creating a need for a more flexible production system. However, the steel industry is characterized by inflexible production systems, with high investment costs inhibiting a transformation. As a result, <b>a</b> <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> between production capabilities and the marketing strategy. As a first step towards eliminating this gap, this thesis aims to identify key factors {{in order to create a}} more flexible and yet cost-efficient production system for steel manufacturers. To generate this knowledge, a number of propositions have been formulated and tested. Further, this study also aims to develop recommendations how the gap between production capabilities and the marketing strategy can be reduced. A case study has been conducted at a Swedish steel manufacturer. Moreover, a simulation model has been developed based on the studied organization’s production system, as a tool to test formulated propositions. Important variables in this study are overproduction, changeover costs, lot sizes, delivery service and lead times. The result of the simulation confirms that the need for flexibility increases with increased production of niche products. Further, in discrete manufacturing there exists a fixed minimum order quantity, which all orders are multiples of. However, this pattern does not apply to the studied company, where the difference in weight between orders can be as little as ten kilograms. As a consequence, the following conclusion was drawn: The ability to produce quantities completely corresponding to customer orders are limited when the minimum lot size exceeds the minimum order quantity, as well as when the limitations for flexible lot sizes, exceeds the minimum difference between the two in quantity most similar orders. Furthermore this study concludes that high changeover costs are the biggest obstacle towards enabling flexible and yet cost-effective manufacturing. Hence, reduction of these costs should also be the main area of focus for the company studied. This study proposes that the high changeover costs are the result of changeover loss realized in material when the changeover station is placed last in the production flow. Therefore, a changeover always reduces throughput for the production system as a whole. However, if the changeover losses instead were realized in time, the output would decrease only when the changeover station is the bottleneck. Furthermore, this study shows that the average economic lot size is significantly larger than the average lot size for the studied company and argues that this is due to high changeover costs. In summary, a marketing strategy resulting in increased production of low-volume products will inevitably increase the current cost- and capability gap further, unless changes in the production capabilities are made. Finally, the following recommendations are proposed:•Invest in expanded capacity in the continuous casting and then convert changeover costs from loss of material to loss of time. •Convert changeover losses to time, when the overcapacity exist in the current continuous casting. This should be done until full utilization is reached. •Transfer low-volume production to a sister factory, with lower switching costs. •Recommendations based on the SMED methodology and continuous improvement to reduce changeover costs.

Based on this study, I introduce a new synchronization policy, weighted-tuple synchronization, and show that it provides a better performance-accuracy trade-off compared to synchronization currently used by state-of-the-art parallel simulators. Next, I study synchronization between separate simulators responsible for modeling heterogeneous components and introduce reciprocal abstraction. Reciprocal abstraction allows asynchronous simulators to exchange information at runtime for more accurate event timing. Lastly, the reciprocal abstraction model relaxes communication latency restrictions and synchronization requirements; I show how relaxed synchronization requirements allows for coprocessor acceleration...|$|R

40|$|In {{the course}} of the 20 th century, {{architectural}} construction has gone through intense innovation in its material, engineering and design, radically transforming the way buildings were and are conceived. Technological and industrial advances enabled and challenged architects, engineers and constructors to build increasingly complex architectural structures from concrete.

40|$|Software {{development}} goals, {{guidelines and}} techniques have changed considerably {{during the last}} decade. New paradigms and ideas such as object orientation and software evolution have led to new system architectures, development strategies, methods and tools. Software process models, however, have not yet evolved sufficiently to support the changes in process management requirements resulting from the paradigmatic and technical changes. This was recently confirmed by an empirical study carried out by an interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, work psychologists and sociologists. Many object-oriented methodologies such as OOA by Shlaer and Mellor, OOAD by G. Booch, OMT by J. Rumbaugh et al. and OOSE by I. Jacobson have improved the technical standards of software development but stick more or less to traditional, phase-oriented process structures. Thus <b>a</b> considerable <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> between modern development techniques and conventional process models and management techniques. A new software process model for evolutionary, object-oriented software development (short: EOS) is presented to fill this gap and to support modern software development by adequate process structures and management techniques. It discards completely the traditional phase structure, being based instead on development cycles and activities associated with the 'objects' of software construction: systems, subsystems, components and classes. Management procedures built upon this framework allow for multi-level, adaptive, differentiated planning and control. This implies new challenges for project managers but also enables them to plan and {{to act in a}} more adequate, dynamic and situational way. (orig.)

40|$|This {{submission}} presents key {{findings to}} date from a critical examination of unemployment benefit sanctions and disallowances {{based primarily on}} statistical analysis. It shows that {{the severity of the}} regime has increased drastically under the Coalition and is increasing further. One fifth of JSA claimants have been sanctioned/disallowed, 4. 2 % per month of all claimants and 8 % per month of those aged 18 - 24. Disallowances for ‘voluntary leaving’ and ‘losing a job through misconduct’ were previously a major component but have almost disappeared in the recession, with disallowances for (not) ‘actively seeking work’ showing a very big increase, and big increases also for non-participation in training (including the Work Programme) and non-compliance with a Jobseeker’s Direction. Severity is greater at times when it is least productive. <b>A</b> <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> been <b>emerging</b> in the treatment of white and minority ethnic groups, and disabled people are over-represented among repeat sanctions/disallowances. The reasons for these differences should be investigated. Although sanctions increase job search and exit from benefits, they cannot be justified when all their effects are considered. These include worse matches of people to jobs, lower productivity, wastefully large numbers of job applications, damage to health, families and relationships, homelessness, destitution as reflected in the rise of Food Banks, increased crime, diversion of Jobcentre resources from their proper role, and creation of a climate of fear and hostility which undermines the whole system. Sanctions, which are financial penalties intended to affect behaviour, should be abolished. Entitlement conditions have to be retained, but should be accompanied by a proper safety net for those disallowed, and an approach to influencing claimants, where justified, which is properly based on behavioural psychology, as pioneered by the Prime Minister’s ‘nudge unit’...|$|R

It {{is to be expected}} that the masses of the ensuing compact remnants correlate with the masses of their progenitor stars, and thus it is generally thought that the remnant masses should be smoothly distributed from the lightest white dwarfs to the heaviest black holes. However, this intuitive prediction is not borne out by observed data. In the rapidly growing population of remnants with observationally determined masses, <b>a</b> striking mass <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> at the boundary between neutron stars and black holes. The heaviest neutron stars reach a maximum of two solar masses, while the lightest black holes are at least five solar masses. Over a decade after the discovery, the <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> become <b>a</b> significant challenge to our understanding of compact object formation. We offer new insights into the physical processes that bifurcate the formation of remnants into lower mass neutron stars and heavier black holes. Combining the results of stellar modeling with hydrodynamic simulations of supernovae, we both explain the existence of the gap, and also put stringent constraints on {{the inner workings of the}} supernova explosion mechanism. In particular, we show that core-collapse supernovae are launched within 100 - 200 milliseconds of the initial stellar collapse, implying that the explosions are driven by instabilities with a rapid (10 - 20 ms) growth time. Alternatively, if future observations fill in the gap, this will be an indication that these instabilities develop over a longer (> 200 milliseconds) timescale.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to address}} <b>a</b> vital <b>gap</b> that <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> {{in the digital}} {{identity}} regulatory discourse: how can the legal regulation of digital identity mirror the global nature of digital identity and be compatible with national local difference? Digital identity, or the digital representation of an individual, is a complex concept, which manifests in myriad forms (e. g. authenticators, claims, data or information, identifiers, presence, relationship representations and reputation) and natures. As such, it engages a gamut of legal domains ranging from criminal law, constitutional law, human rights law, law of identity schemes, contract law, intellectual property law, tort law and data protection law. Digital identity is global and local in its nature, influence and effects. Yet, the digital identity regulatory discourse has primarily developed in and focussed on the digitally advanced West, leaving out countries like India which are developing strong digital presences, with their own digital identity perceptions and needs. This situation is adverse to the sustained future of digital identity. Thus, the contribution of this thesis lies in filling this gap and preparing the ground for a dialogue between different countries with different national agendas through building international and local awareness of how similarities and differences operate in respect of digital identity, its regulation and providing a modest solution to help preserve the global and local dimensions of digital identity and its regulation. To this end, the thesis carried out comparative legal research on the legal regulation of digital identity using the UK and India as base jurisdictions. The original hypothesis was that that immense differences in the legal regulation of digital identity between the comparator countries would emerge. Yet, though differences were evident, considerable degrees of similarity also emerged, {{not just on the}} superficial level of mere identity of rules, but also in legal practice, in large part attributable to India’s penchant for legal transplants. While the transplantation of Western law did not result in a full-scale rejection of the transplanted laws in relation to digital identity in India, there are indications of anomalies caused by the imposition of Western cultural norms through law on an Indian society ill prepared for it. Thus there has resulted a tension between the local and the global, the indigenous and the externally imposed. The challenge is thus to resolve this, taking into account, on the one hand the need to maintain the global nature and relevance of digital identity and the other, the need to accommodate and be responsive to local differences. The thesis proposes a tentative solution called the tri-elemental framework (TeF) which draws from the Indian philosophical and legal concept of dharma (and its elements of Sad Achara, Vyavahara and Prayaschitta) and learns from the most universally relevant digital identity proposal, De Hert’s right to identity. The solution provides one way in which the law regulating digital identity, whatever its nature, can be made sense of and acquire cultural meaning appropriate to local contexts...|$|R

40|$|It {{should be}} noted that {{comparative}} religion to a large extent still remains an under developed field in Western academia even to this day. We find that today there are a great number of works and esteemed writers who have written a great deal on the respective faiths in quite detail. However, by the same virtue, we find that works, journals and indeed articles on the facets of comparative religion are in short supply and {{it can be said that}} demand for such treatises/discussions exceeds supply in the world of academia. My reasons for conducting a study of the main facets of the Abrahamic faiths stems from a desire to encourage and bring advances in the field of comparative religion. I believe studies in comparative religion have the ability to stimulate discussion and advance research with the main aim of fostering dialogue and mutual respect between the faiths. It is essential that the children of tomorrow see a bright future where mutual respect, tolerance and understanding is the order of the day rather than witnessing an environment dominated by suspicion, conflict and contempt based on misunderstandings. This thesis is unique in many ways more than one that will come apparent in due course. Firstly, this work marks a first from the point of view in which the main tenets of faith found in the Old, New Testament and the Qur'an are explored in extensive detail with the aim of highlighting similarities and indeed differences that in the main centre upon doctrinal issues. Recent modern scholarship has tended to discuss and criticise doctrinal points with little emphasis being placed on comparative elements. Secondly, if one conducts a literature review of works on the Abrahamic faiths, it is not surprising to find writers and commentators have solely concentrated on doctrines pertaining on solely one faith. It seems many in the academic world have shied away from conducting a comparative study of the doctrines found in the Abrahamic faiths. At this point, I shall make it clear that I have deliberately chosen to ignore faiths, such as Hinduism and Sikh ism not through ignorance, but primarily due to constraints placed by the thesis, as well as the fact that these great faiths do not share a common denominator witnessed in the form of Abraham, who undoubtedly is the father of the three monotheistic faiths namely, Judaism, Christianity, and last but not least Islam. One might at this point be inclined to ask why conduct such a study involving medieval and modern concepts of creation within a scriptural context. I am of the view that such a study was required for a number of reasons that I shall outline in due course. Recent modern scholarship in the last fifty years has tended to focus upon the medieval concepts of creation and emanation in Judeo-Christian and Islamic philosophy and theology and as a result we find a plethora of treatises and works devoted to the above subjects. For example, writers such as Herbert Davison and Harry Austyn Wolfson as well as other academics devoted a great deal of time and energy in giving us access to knowledge about theology and philosophy that was previously only available to those who had a mastery of the Greek and Arabic language. Despite this significant contribution made by the aforementioned scholars, we find that the heirs to Wolfson and Davison <b>have</b> not <b>emerged</b> in the world of Western academia that are prepared to explore the new relationship between religion and modern science in the 21 st century. As a consequence, <b>a</b> research <b>gap</b> <b>has</b> <b>emerged</b> that is crying out to be filled and currently we have a situation where little attention and focus has been placed on the works of modern scholars exploring the relationship between modern science and the theological interpretations concerning the existence of God and humankind for that matter. Part one of the thesis compares the main tenets of faith found in the three scriptures mentioned earlier. The scriptures repeatedly refer to the themes of monotheism, stories of the prophets and eschatology, as well as the purpose and significance of creation. The Qur'anic scripture discusses the above themes throughout the 114 chapters. The Old Testament and New Testament also refer to the above themes. Part two of the thesis takes a detailed look at the concept of creation in the Abrahamic faiths with particular emphasis being placed on its evolution from the medieval period to the present day. It {{should be noted}} that the Old Testament devotes a single chapter to the subject of creation widely known as the Book of Genesis, but the Qur'an does not do so with the exception that there are several references in various verses throughout the scripture that pay attention to this subject. The New Testament again like the Qur'an does not provide a detailed discussion concerning the merits of creation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
