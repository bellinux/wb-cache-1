50|$|Government of India v Taylor 1955 AC 491 (sometimes called Re Delhi Electric Supply & Traction Co Ltd) is a {{judicial}} {{decision of the}} House of Lords relating to the enforceability of foreign tax claims under English law. The House of Lords unanimously upheld the general rule at common law that foreign tax claims are non-justiciable in England under the Act of state doctrine. Accordingly, a claim with respect to foreign taxes was not an <b>admissible</b> <b>claim</b> in the liquidation of a United Kingdom company. The English courts may not, directly or indirectly, enforce the tax claims of another sovereign state.|$|E
40|$|The {{right to}} {{nationality}} is {{embodied in the}} Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) {{as one of the}} Human Rights granted to every human being. Although it was consequently included in several international documents, is considered to be still more like a directive of conduct for States than a legally <b>admissible</b> <b>claim</b> of an individual. By custom, it is the right of each State to determine who its nationals are. The source of that ambiguity could be found in controversies arising from the dual nature of nationality, as a legal bond between a State and an individual, recognized both in public international law and domestic law of every State...|$|E
40|$|Courtroom battles {{surrounding}} school {{finance and}} adequacy claims {{are very much}} alive today, nearly forty years after their progenitor, Serrano v. Priest. In spawning a potential new chapter in this history, a trial court in California struck down its state’s battalion of teacher tenure and employment laws under a legal analysis based in the education quality that those laws provided. This “landmark” case, Vergara, is generating conversation that its results could be duplicated throughout the nation. In a format familiar to school finance litigation, the Vergara court found that the state’s tenure statutes so detrimentally affected teaching that education quality was unconstitutionally harmed. While this result may seem extreme, the history of state education litigation, with comparisons to federal segregation litigation, shows not only that these dramatic remedies are not surprising but also that an application of the political question doctrine proves effective in scaling back any policy-based court excesses. As will be argued here, then, Vergara displays the natural conclusion of courts accepting inherently political questions as <b>admissible</b> <b>claims...</b>|$|R

40|$|Will a {{party who}} {{believes}} {{that he has a}} legally <b>admissible</b> <b>claim</b> for money damages decide to bring suit? if so, will he subsequently settle with the opposing party or will he go ahead to trial? These questions are analyzed under four methods for allocating legal costs, namely, under the American system, whereby each side bears its own costs; under the "indemnity" or British system, whereby the losing side bears all costs; under the system favoring the plaintiff whereby the plaintiff pays only his own costs if he loses and nothing otherwise; and under the system favor the defendant, whereby the defendant pays only his own costs if he loses and nothing otherwise. Following the analysis, two brief illustrations are considered and comments are made on the relative social desirability of the methods of allocating legal costs. ...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{processes}} of common use in mathematical finance are presented throughout this book, {{which consists of}} eleven chapters, interlacing {{on the one hand}} financial concepts and instruments, such as arbitrage opportunities, <b>admissible</b> strategies, contingent <b>claims,</b> option pricing, default risk, ruin, and on the other hand, Brownian motion, diffusion processes, Lévy processes, together with the basic properties of these processes. The first half of the book is devoted to continuous path processes whereas the second half deals with discontinuous processes. Only basic knowledge of probability theory is assumed; the book is organized so that the mathematical facts pertaining to a given financial question are gathered close to the study of that question...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} Elizabeth Gaskell 2 ̆ 7 s novels (Mary Barton, Ruth, North and South, Cranford, Sylvia 2 ̆ 7 s Lovers, and Wives and Daughters) challenge nineteenth-century notions {{of what constitutes}} reliable, credible, and <b>admissible</b> truth <b>claims.</b> Gaskell challenges the protocols for judging truth that are emerging {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} in response to new epistemic conditions and protocols that threaten to silence female speakers, whether they are advocating on their own behalf (as defendants) or on behalf of others (as witnesses). By using the decidedly male legal system in the form of courtroom trials and interrogation-like scenarios for her female characters in their everyday lives, Gaskell shows her reading 2 ̆ 2 jury 2 ̆ 2 that judgments are too quickly dispensed and verdicts erroneously assumed, and she thus promotes sympathetic judgments of others, women specifically. In her fiction, she seeks temporal justice for her heroines, and, when that is unachievable, she has them seek divine justice instead. To establish the credibility of her heroines, Gaskell uses a rich array of narrative devices to critique women 2 ̆ 7 s discursive abilities and to re-authorize their representations of reality. This dissertation focuses on examples of trials, evidence, and testimony as they play out via plot, character, and narration. In plot, she arranges events in order to provide her heroines with opportunities to speak and act. To establish character, she develops her heroines through description, actions, interiority, and dialogue, all of which prepare the reader to take as credible the speech of the heroine in her climactic utterance of a powerful truth. Through narrative voice, she advocates for credible judgments by incorporating moral discourse, personal disclosures, and intrusive narrators. Gaskell 2 ̆ 7 s novels strive to promote sympathy, reasonable judgments, and more measured perceptions in her readers. In her fiction, she not only proclaims that women are credible truth-tellers but, by constructing her stories in ways that give female characters agency, she leads her readers to this same conclusion...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{in these}} {{circumstances}} the Austrian Court, who at this time (1685) greatly needed the Elector's help against Turks and others, and found him very urgent about these Silesian Duchies of his, fell upon what I must call a very extraordinary shift for {{getting rid of the}} Silesian question. [...] "Serene Highness," [...] said they, by their Ambassador at Berlin, [...] "to end these troublesome talks, and to liquidate all <b>claims,</b> <b>admissible</b> and inadmissible, about Silesia, the Imperial Majesty will give you an actual bit of Territory, valuable, though not so large as you expected!" [...] The Elector listens with both ears: What Territory, then? The [...] "Circle of Schwiebus," [...] hanging on the northwestern edge of Silesia, contiguous to the Elector's own Dominions in these Frankfurt-on-Oder regions: this the generous Imperial Majesty proposes to give in fee-simple to Friedrich Wilhelm, and so to end the matter. Truly a most small patch of Territory in comparison; not bigger than an English Rutlandshire, to say nothing of soil and climate! But then again it was an actual patch of territory; not a mere parchment shadow of one: this last was a tempting point to the old harassed Elector. Such friendly offer they made him, I think, in 1685, at the time they were getting 8,000 of his troops to march against the Turks for them; a very needful service at the moment. [...] "By the bye, do not march through Silesia, you!--Or march faster!" [...] said the cautious Austrians on this occasion: [...] "Other roads will answer better than Silesia!" [...] said they. [Pauli, v. 327, 332.] Baron Freytag, their Ambassador at Berlin, had negotiated the affair so far: [...] "Circle of Schwiebus," [...] said Freytag, [...] "and let us have done with these thorny talks!" ...|$|R
