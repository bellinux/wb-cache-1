The five subjects are, in chronological order: the illegal drug trade, the seaport system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of actors who are little known for their other roles, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is [...] "really about the American city, and <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally, Lundgren {{planned on}} playing a {{supporting}} role, {{with a more}} famous actor in the lead.

500|$|Mystery writer Andrew Klavan, {{writing in}} The Wall Street Journal, {{compared}} the extreme measures that Batman takes to fight crime with those U.S. President George W.

Bush {{in this time of}} terror and war." [...] Klavan supports this reading of the film by comparing Batman—like Bush, Klavan argues—"sometimes has to push the boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that he will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past." [...] Klavan's article has received criticism on the Internet and in mainstream media outlets, such as in The New Republics [...] "The Plank." [...] Reviewing the film in The Sunday Times, Cosmo Landesman reached the opposite conclusion to Klavan, arguing that The Dark Knight [...] "offers up a lot of moralistic waffle <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>we</b> must hug a terrorist– okay, I exaggerate. At its heart, however, is a long and tedious discussion about how individuals and society must never abandon the rule of law in struggling against the forces of lawlessness. In fighting monsters, we must be careful not to become monsters– that sort of thing. The film champions the anti-war coalition's claim that, in having a war on terror, you create the conditions for more terror. We are shown that innocent people died because of Batman– and he falls for it." [...] Benjamin Kerstein, writing in Azure, says that both Klavan and Landesman [...] "have a point," [...] because [...] "The Dark Knight is a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, {{for the first time in}} decades, an American mainstream no longer exists." ...|$|E
