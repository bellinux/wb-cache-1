50|$|Some Application Layer {{protocols}} (such as FTP and SIP) send explicit network addresses {{within their}} application data. FTP in active mode, for example, uses separate connections for control traffic (commands) and for data traffic (file contents). When requesting a file transfer, <b>the</b> host <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request</b> identifies <b>the</b> corresponding data connection by its network layer and transport layer addresses. If <b>the</b> host <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request</b> lies behind a simple NAT firewall, {{the translation of}} the IP address and/or TCP port number makes the information received by the server invalid. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) controls many Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, and suffers the same problem. SIP and SDP may use multiple ports {{to set up a}} connection and transmit voice stream via RTP. IP addresses and port numbers are encoded in the payload data and must be known prior to the traversal of NATs. Without special techniques, such as STUN, NAT behavior is unpredictable and communications may fail.|$|R

40|$|While many {{researchers}} have thoroughly studied the static dial-a-ride system, the scheduling {{of the dynamic}} dial-a-ride system has not been well studied. There have been attempts to extend the static solutions to a dynamic counterpart. But, one inherent problem with the extended solutions is that characteristics of static solutions are carried over to the solutions of a dynamic problem. Current solutions use single depot, and, limits on wait time for service after <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request,</b> have forced many of requests to be rejected. In this research, a new algorithm based on partitions, subjected to limit on wait time for service after <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request,</b> is developed. ^ The proposed algorithm eliminates rejection of any customer request {{from anywhere in the}} service area. A combination of an existing scheduling algorithm, like a dynamic basic parallel algorithm, with this newly suggested algorithm is recommended for better performance. This combination is recommended only when the ridership is mixed in density. Three sets of experiments were conducted for evaluation and comparison of scheduling efficiency of the existing dynamic dial-a-ride algorithms and the new partition based algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} modifiable {{factors that}} influence relatives' decision to allow organ donation. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL, without language restriction, searched to April 2008. Review methods Three authors independently assessed the eligibility of the identified studies. We excluded studies that examined only factors affecting consent {{that could not be}} altered, such as donor ethnicity. We extracted quantitative results to an electronic database. For data synthesis, we summarised the results of studies comparing similar themes. RESULTS: We included 20 observational studies and audits. There were no randomised controlled trials. The main factors associated with reduced rates of refusal were the provision of adequate information on the process of organ donation and its benefits; high quality of care of potential organ donors; ensuring relatives had a clear understanding of brain stem death; separating <b>the</b> <b>request</b> for organ donation from notification that the patient had died; <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request</b> in a private setting; and using trained and experienced individuals to make <b>the</b> <b>request.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests that there are modifiable factors in <b>the</b> process of <b>requests</b> for organ donation, in particular the skills of <b>the</b> individual <b>making</b> <b>the</b> <b>request</b> and <b>the</b> timing of this conversation, that might {{have a significant impact on}} rates of consent. Targeting these factors might have a greater and more immediate effect on the number of organs for donation than legislative or other long term strategies...|$|R
