5|$|Two {{pilots were}} filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci {{decided to create}} <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>about</b> one. With the {{encouragement}} of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, {{over the course of}} 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed to produce it about halfway through their presentation.|$|E
5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>about</b> the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>about</b> alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter {{in a town}} called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. In a clearing, he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E
5|$|Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, {{game show}} host, and comedian, {{best known for}} his {{character}} Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>about</b> a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful special about it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade, Reubens would be completely committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was less successful than its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|Veteran Disney Channel writers Schooley and McCorkle were {{recruited}} by the network to develop an animated series that could attract both younger and older audiences, and conceived Kim Possible as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>about</b> a talented action heroine and her less competent sidekick. Inspired by the scarcity of female-led animated series at the time, the episodes, {{some of which are}} based on the creators' own high school experiences, combine elements of action, adventure, drama, romance and comedy to appeal to both girls and boys, while parodying the James Bond franchise, spy and superhero films, and teen sitcoms. Distinct from other Disney Channel shows in its use of self-referential humor, Schooley and McCorkle developed fast-paced sitcom-style dialogue to cater to adult viewers. Set in fictional Middleton, USA, the show's setting and locations exhibit a retro-influenced aesthetic. With a strong emphasis on modern-day technology and the Internet, the series also explores themes such as feminism, girl power and relationships, and receives heavy comparisons to other female-driven action shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Alias and The Powerpuff Girls.|$|E

25|$|However, {{this was}} during {{an era of}} rapid shifts within the {{aviation}} industry.
