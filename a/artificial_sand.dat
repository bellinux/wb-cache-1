500|$|In the Carolinas, the National Guard was mobilised by {{the evening}} of October 15 to prevent looting along {{affected}} areas of the coastline. On October 17, President Dwight D.

[...] Recovery was quick, and by October 24, all but two units were demobilised. Another concern was the rebuilding of the sand dunes along waterfronts. An <b>artificial</b> <b>sand</b> dune barrier, [...] long, was completed by October 30, which {{in the long run}} led to a more rapid natural build-up of larger dunes. With Myrtle Beach a popular tourist destination, the Chamber of Commerce began an information campaign to inform the public, which might have erroneously concluded from the massive media coverage that the city had been destroyed, that the city would be ready for the coming summer.

500|$|In any {{crossing}} of the Suez Canal by Egyptian forces, success was highly dependent {{on the performance of}} the Egyptian Corps of Engineers, which had several daunting tasks to accomplish. Israeli engineers had constructed a massive <b>artificial</b> <b>sand</b> barrier spanning [...] of the canal's east bank (except for the Great Bitter Lake, where the width of the canal made a crossing unlikely). To prevent erosion, the sand barrier was supported by concrete, which was one metre (3⅓ ft) above the water at high tide, and three metres (10ft) above water at low tide. The canal was [...] wide and approximately [...] deep. Engineers had to clear seventy passages through this sand wall, each seven metres (23ft) wide. This meant the removal of [...] of sand for each passage. Initially, conventional methods were tested for breaching the sand wall. It was found that, to clear a single passage required 60 men, 1 bulldozer, 600lb of explosives and five to six hours, uninterrupted by enemy fire. Since the crossing sites would likely be congested and under enemy fire, these methods proved to be impractical and too costly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describe}} a laboratory {{investigation into the}} effects of adding silica sand and/or cement on the behaviour of <b>artificial</b> carbonate <b>sand</b> under shear and compression. Drained shear and compressibility tests have been performed on <b>artificial</b> carbonate <b>sand</b> samples and <b>artificial</b> carbonate <b>sand</b> samples mixed with different proportion by weight of silica sand and/or cement {{in order to determine}} the shear stress-strain and compressibility characteristics of the mixed material. The results demonstrate that contraction during shear and compressibility during isotropic compression decrease as the fraction of silica sand and/or cement increases within the <b>artificial</b> carbonate <b>sand.</b> A positive volumetric change (dilation) during shear is more obvious with cemented samples. It also demonstrate how the addition of a combination of silica sand and cement produces the most effective improvement in terms of strength, stiffness, compressibility and crushing...|$|R

500|$|The Israelis had {{constructed}} {{a series of}} fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line, which was considered impregnable. The main obstacle of these defences was a massive <b>artificial</b> <b>sand</b> wall erected by Israeli engineers, [...] high with a 45–60 degree incline, along the entire Suez Canal. The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the sand wall. To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty-four, probably forty-eight hours. Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints. On average, the fortifications were [...] apart. A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000-pound (~½ ton) bomb. Strongpoints incorporated trenches, barbed wire, minefields 200 meters deep, numerous bunkers and troop shelters, and firing positions for tanks. Each strongpoint had an underground reservoir filled with crude oil. The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a pipe system, and ignited to create temperatures reaching [...] A second defensive line, [...] behind the main line, was concentrated at likely crossing areas, and designed to be occupied by armored forces, incorporating tank firing positions. A third defensive line, [...] behind the sand rampart, had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker. Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry, supply depots, numerous artillery positions and so forth.|$|E

40|$|<b>Artificial</b> {{cemented}} <b>sand</b> {{test samples}} were prepared by using ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as the cementing agent. Through uniaxial compression tests and consolidated drained triaxial compression tests, the stress-strain curves of the <b>artificial</b> cemented <b>sand</b> with different cementing agent contents (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05 and 0. 08) under various confining pressures (0. 00 MPa, 0. 25 MPa, 0. 50 MPa and 1. 00 MPa) were obtained. Based {{on the test}} results, {{the effect of the}} cementing agent content (Cv) on the physical and mechanical properties of the <b>artificial</b> cemented <b>sand</b> were analyzed and the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory was modified by using Cv. The research reveals that when Cv is high (e. g., Cv = 0. 03, 0. 05 or 0. 08), the stress-strain curves of the samples indicate a strain softening behavior; under the same confining pressure, as Cv increases, both the peak strength and residual strength of the samples show a significant increase. When Cv is low (e. g., Cv = 0. 01), the stress-strain curves of the samples indicate strain hardening behavior. From the test data, a function of Cv (the cementing agent content) with c′ (the cohesion force of the sample) and Δϕ′ (the increment of the angle of shearing resistance) is obtained. Furthermore, through modification of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, the effect of cementing agent content on the strength of the cemented sand is demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|The Streckelsberg {{was formed}} {{during the last}} ice age as a push moraine. At that time over 16,000 years ago large parts of central and {{northern}} Europe were covered by a massive ice sheet. During the gradual retreat of the ice, there were repeated smaller advances of the glacier that {{led to the formation of}} moraines. The Streckelsberg was formed during such an advance, when the glacier pushed loose sedimentary rock in front of it, piling it up. When the ice retreated further, the first Baltic proglacial lake was formed from the meltwaters and rising sea levels, later the Yoldia Sea and Ancylus Lake were created and, ultimately, the Baltic Sea in its present shape. Originally, the Streckelsberg was much larger than it is today, both in terms of size and height. Through erosion processes the Streckelsberg soon shrank, particularly as a result of breakers from the Baltic Sea. Wave and wind erosion has reduced the Streckelsberg by 250 m in the last 300 years. This process still continues, despite coastal protection measures taken in 1995, including groynes, two breakwaters, a triple protective wall and the dumping of <b>artificial</b> <b>sand.</b> In strong storms, parts of the cliff frequently break off and slump down onto the beach.|$|E

It is a popular swimming destination and offers a good swim from the beach to two rock formations called Breadloaf and the Whale's Back. There are trails all around the lake, and going to Leblin Park and other places such as the Greystone and Green Acres subdivisions. The granite barrens south of the lake are an excellent place to find blueberries, which foxes and porcupines share with the more adventurous of the local children. The most famous portion of the park is the Rocking Stone, a 90+ ton glacial erratic boulder which can still be rocked with a lever, but which used to move quite easily, before a band of sailors from the nearby Halifax garrison rocked it into a more stable configuration in the 1890s, and before its base was worn down by excessive rocking in the 1980s and 90s when the park was first developed. A lesser known but equally interesting large glacially-deposited granite monolith called Table Rock, can be found NW of the narrow passage at {{the northern end of}} the lake, where it empties into a boggy area: it is a flat, approximately 30 ton rock firmly balanced upon three rocks, the smallest of which {{is about the size of}} a volleyball.|$|E
