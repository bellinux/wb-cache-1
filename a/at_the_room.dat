Afterwards, Adams went in London, under the management of M. Farini, to play <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> of John Roberts, Jr. On a previous trip to London in 1887, Roberts offered Adams £60 a week for six months to give exhibitions, but Adams declined, citing a need to superintend his sporting journal.|$|E

25|$|Her mother, of the House of Hohenzollern, was a {{woman of}} quite distraught {{temperament}} and was melancholic. It is possible she was insane. After the king died on 6November 1632 on the battlefield, his corpse was brought home in a coffin, with his heart in a separate box. Maria Eleonora ordered that the king should not be buried until she could be buried with him. She also demanded that the coffin be kept open, and went to see it regularly, patting it and taking no notice of the putrefaction. Eventually, the embarrassed Chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, saw no other solution than to have a guard posted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to prevent further episodes. As a result, he was not buried until 22June 1634, more than eighteen months later.|$|E

But when the confrontation forces Sōjirō to question Shishio's principles, his true emotions surface with allowing Kenshin now able to read his moves and defeat him. Despite his defeat, Sōjirō informs Yumi of the key to Kenshin's ultimate attack while asking her to give Shishio the wakizashi that kept before leaving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goals of}} PIP-II include {{a plan to}} {{delivery}} 1.2MW of proton beam power from the Main Injector to the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment target at 120GeV and the power near 1MW at 60GeV with a possibility to extend the power to 2MW in the future. The plan should also support the current 8GeV experiments including Mu2e, g−2, and other short-baseline neutrino experiments. These require an upgrade to the linac to inject to the Booster with 800MeV. The first option is to add 400MeV [...] "afterburner" [...] superconducting linac {{at the tail end}} of the existing 400MeV. This requires moving the existing [...] linac up [...] However, there are many technical issues with this approach. The preferred option is to build a new 800MeV superconducting linac to inject to the Booster ring. The new linac site will be located on top of a small portion of Tevatron near the Booster ring in order to take advantage of existing electrical and water, and cryogenic infrastructure. The PIP-II linac will have low energy beam transport line (LEBT), radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ), and medium energy beam transport line (MEBT) operated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> temperature at with a 162.5MHz and energy increasing from 0.03MeV. The first segment of linac will be operated at 162.5MHz and energy increased up to 11MeV. The second segment of linac will be operated at 325MHz and energy increased up to 177MeV. The last segment of linac will be operated at 650MHz and will have the final energy level of 800MeV.|$|E
