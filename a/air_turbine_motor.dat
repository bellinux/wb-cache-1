50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an {{aircraft}} APU is to provide power to start the main engines. Turbine engines must be accelerated to a high rotational speed to provide sufficient air compression for self-sustaining operation. Smaller jet engines are usually started by an electric motor, while larger engines are usually started by an <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> <b>motor.</b> Before the engines are to be turned, the APU is started, generally by a battery or hydraulic accumulator. Once the APU is running, it provides power (electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic, depending on the design) to start the aircraft's main engines.|$|E

Turbine similarity design based on the existing <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> profiles is time saving. Due to totally different thermodynamic properties between organic fluids and air, its influence on turbine performance and loss mechanisms need to be analyzed. This paper numerically simulated a radial turbine under similar conditions between R 245 fa and air, and compared the differences of the turbine performance and loss mechanisms.

As R 245 fa gas constant is only about one-fifth of air gas constant, reduced rotating speeds of R 245 fa turbine are only 0. 4 -fold of those of <b>air</b> <b>turbine,</b> and reduced mass flow rates are about twice of those of <b>air</b> <b>turbine.</b> When using R 245 fa as working fluid, the nozzle shock wave losses decrease but rotor suction surface separation vortex losses increase, and eventually leads that isentropic efficiencies of R 245 fa turbine in the commonly used velocity ratio range from 0. 5 to 0. 9 are 3 %â€“ 4 % lower than those of <b>air</b> <b>turbine...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} development of a microfabricated turbopump capable of delivering fuel with the flow rates and pressures required for portable power generation. The device is composed of a spiral-groove viscous pump that is driven by a radial in-flow <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> and supported using a novel encapsulated microball bearing. First, the encapsulated microball bearing and methods to investigate the wear and friction behaviors were developed. Two primary raceway designs, point-contact and planar-contact designs, were developed with the key design factor being wearing of the raceway. A modification to the planar-contact design was made for the final turbopump that reduced both wear and debris generation. Second, two <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> platforms were developed using the encapsulated microball bearings to characterize both the bearing and the turbine drive mechanism. A tangential <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> platform was first developed and characterized using the point-contact bearing mechanism. Rotational speeds > 37, 000 rpm were demonstrated and long-term operation (> 24 hours) using this platform, but with large driving pressures (tens of psi) and large raceway wear (tens of microns). Furthermore, the circumferential asymmetry of the turbine design led to difficulty in measuring pressure distribution and sealing for pump applications. Results from the tangential <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> platform led to an axisymmetric radial in-flow <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> platform using a planar-contact bearing design. Rotational speeds greater than 85, 000 rpm with turbine pressure differentials in the range of 1 psi were demonstrated using this platform. The wear of the raceway was observed to be on the order of single microns (a 10 x improvement). The radial in-flow <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> platform allowed an empirical model to be developed relating the friction torque to the rotational speed and load for the planar-contact bearing. This enabled calculation of the power balance for pumping and a method to characterize future bearing designs and materials. Lastly, a microfabricated turbopump was demonstrated based on a spiral-groove viscous pump and the radial in-flow turbine platform using the planar-contact bearing. Pumping operation was demonstrated with a differential pressure up to + 0. 3 psi and flow rates ranging from 35 mL/hour to 70 mL/hour, within the range relevant to portable power generation...|$|R

40|$|Subcutaneous emphysema, {{is a rare}} {{occurrence}} in dental practice. It is usually benign and self-limiting; nevertheless, severe consequences can result from surgical treatment. Emphysema occurs when air is injected into the subcutaneous layer of the tissue, this may come from either an <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> handpiece or <b>air</b> syringe. Due to the danger of developing emphysema, procedures using compressed air are not recommended in dental extractions involving the raising of a skin flap, bone sectioning or exeresis. Two determining factors are always involved with subcutaneous emphysema. On the one hand, a compressed <b>air</b> procedure (<b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> handpiece, air-water syringe), and on the other, a communication between the oral cavity and deeper tissue producing dissection. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent the trapped air leaking into other areas.

40|$|The {{oscillating}} {{water column}} (OWC) equipped with an <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> is possibly the most reliable type of wave en-ergy converter. The OWC spar-buoy is a simple concept for a floating OWC. It is an axisymmetric device (and so insensitive to wave direction) consisting basically of a (rela-tively long) submerged vertical tail tube open at both ends and fixed to a floater that moves essentially in heave. The air flow displaced by {{the motion of the}} OWC inner free-surface, relative to the buoy, drives an <b>air</b> <b>turbine.</b> The choice of <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> type and size, the regulation of the tur-bine rotational speed and the rated power of the electrical equipment strongly affect the power performance of the de-vice and also the equipmentâ€™s capital cost. Here, numerical procedures and results are presented for the power output from turbines of different sizes equipping a given OWC spar-buoy in a given offshore wave climate, the rotational speed being optimized for each of the sea states that, together with their frequency of occurrence, characterize the wave climate. The new biradial self-rectifying <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> was chosen as appropriate to the relatively large amplitude of the pressure oscillations in the OWC air chamber. Since the turbine is strongly non-linear and a fully-nonlinear model of air compressibility was adopted, a time domain analy-sis was required. The boundary-element numerical code WAMIT was used to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients of the buoy and OWC, whereas the non-dimensional per-formance curves of the turbine were obtained from model testing. âˆ—Address all correspondence to this author...|$|R
