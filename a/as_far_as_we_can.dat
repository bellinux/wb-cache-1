Personally, I don't have a lot of personal goals right now, they're more team-oriented, besides me getting on the field and proving I can take over this thing." [...] Kolb gained many comparisons to the situation Aaron Rodgers endured backing up Brett Favre during his first three seasons. Kolb and Rodgers reached out to one another to share their similar plights.|$|E
500|$|Aside from this, Adams {{generally}} stayed quiet. He did {{not publicly}} criticize Jefferson's actions as president, believing that [...] "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> <b>can</b> in Justice." [...] He did, however, privately attack the president over his Embargo Act, {{despite the fact}} that it was voted for by his son John Quincy, a U.S. senator. Another incident began in relation to Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his [...] "partiality for monarchy" [...] and [...] "pride of talents and much ambition." [...] A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, the friendship healed.|$|E

500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has {{that got to do with}} you?... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can,</b> take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work. Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E
500|$|Orr {{was also}} {{involved}} in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players' pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players {{to give up a}} seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> understand, have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E
500|$|The Persians had {{encountered}} hoplites in battle before at Ephesus, where their cavalry had easily routed the (probably exhausted) Greeks. However, {{at the battle}} of Marathon, the Athenian hoplites had shown their superiority over the Persian infantry, albeit {{in the absence of any}} cavalry. It is therefore slightly surprising that the Persians did not bring any hoplites from the Greek regions, especially Ionia, under their control in Asia. Equally, Herodotus tells us that the Egyptian marines serving in the navy were well armed, and performed well against the Greek marines; yet no Egyptian contingent served in the army. The Persians may not have completely trusted the Ionians and Egyptians, since both had recently revolted against Persian rule. However, if this is the case, then it must be questioned why there were Greek and Egyptian contingents in the navy. The Allies evidently tried to play on the Persian fears about the reliability of the Ionians in Persian service; but, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> tell, both the Ionians and Egyptians performed particularly well for the Persian navy. It may therefore simply be that neither the Ionians nor Egyptians were included in the army because they were serving in the fleet [...] none of the coastal regions of the Persian empire appear to have sent contingents with the army.|$|E

The Library of the Fine Arts was critical of its [...] "pantomimic" [...] quality, which it considered [...] "calculated to excite any but such ideas as we should wish to see produced by Art", while The Examiner complained about the depiction of women being attacked, arguing: [...] "Mr Etty should not treat the fair sex in this harsh and wanton manner. We doubt his right to put {{a single one of}} them into the hands of a Demon, much less to deliver them over by the dozen to the grasp of the destroyers."

2500|$|The mastermind {{behind the}} siege was Commodore Willem Jacobszoon Coster, second-in-command of the Dutch expeditionary force to Sri Lanka.

He described {{his plans to}} land troops beyond {{the range of the}} fort guns to exploit the Galle fort’s inherent weakness, “... there is a highland like the promontory, so that one can easily fire with guns from there at the city and the principal fort, and, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> gather, can throw (grenades) with mortars, and we shall obliged to take it in this manner.” Van Diemen, writing back on 11 August 1638, ordered that Galle was a priority target and to capture it before Colombo. He further added “... it [...] offers an excellent harbor for vessels which can anchor there at any time of the year”, which better suited their future plans.|$|E

2500|$|In 1915, De Casseres {{published}} his first book, {{a collection of}} poetry titled The Shadow-Eater, to mixed reviews. Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff called the volume [...] "a welcome tribute to individualism and defiance" [...] and the poems themselves [...] "metaphysical meteors, searching, cataclysmic and rich in satire." [...] A review in The New York Times favorably compared De Casseres to Walt Whitman, claiming [...] "if his alien, highly individual genius remains unrecognized, criticism will lie upon the public, not upon him." [...] Others, however, received it less favorably. Clement Wood, writing in the New York Call, mocked both De Casseres' book and Wagstaff's review, writing, [...] "It must be admitted that Mr. De Casseres often uses good rhythms; what they are about is another thing. They are mainly about Nothing, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> gather."

2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the working expenses small, there is every reason to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] <b>As</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E
