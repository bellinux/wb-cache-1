And therefore our express pleasure and commandment is that, all delays and excuses laid apart, you do presently upon the duty of your allegiance obey and fulfill whatsoever the bearer hereof shall direct you to do in our name. Whereof fail you not, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> answer the contrary at your utmost peril.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|Those who won our {{independence}} [...] [...] [...] {{believed that}} freedom to think <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> {{and to speak}} as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth; that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile; that with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine; that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people; that public discussion is a political duty; and that {{this should be a}} fundamental principle of the American government.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Wiseau {{mentioned}} {{plans for}} a Broadway adaptation of the film, {{in which he would}} appear only on opening night: [...] "It will be similar to {{what you see in the}} movie, except it will be musical. As well <b>as,</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see… like, for example, Johnny, we could have maybe 10 Johnnys at the same time singing, or playing football. So, the decision have to be made at the time when we actually doing choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny." [...] He mentioned the plans again during a 2016 interview describing his idea for it to be a [...] "musical slash comedy." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were {{overwhelmingly}} {{positive for}} [...] "Subway". It was identified by The Baltimore Sun {{as one of}} the ten best episodes of the series, with Sun writer Chris Kaltenbach declaring, [...] "Dramas don't come any better than this." [...] Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register said it was [...] "perhaps the best Homicide episode ever" [...] and praised D'Onofrio's performance. USA Today gave the episode its highest rating of four stars. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called it, [...] "a tour de force for D'Onofrio and Braugher". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said, [...] "This is as gripping an hour of television as you're ever likely to see." [...] Television and literary critic John Leonard said that [...] "Subway" [...] was [...] "an artistic experience that is as genuine and accomplished and crafted <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> get anywhere". David P. Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, said of the episode, [...] "Writer James Yoshimura proves that he has not lost his touch, with yet another truly grueling screenplay." ...|$|E

500|$|Jim Shelley {{from the}} Daily Mirror praised Jordan's writing and Brown's acting, saying [...] "tonight's episode of EastEnders is as {{powerful}} and poignant {{a piece of}} drama <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see on TV all year". Shelley opined that [...] "June [...] proves what the soaps can achieve when they use actors of genuine class and let them show what they are capable of" [...] and stated [...] "The fact that co-star John Bardon [...] is recovering from a stroke in real life adds an extra terrible pathos to the episode." [...] Cole Moreton of The Independent wrote [...] "The preview disc had revealed {{it to be a}} mesmerising piece of television, a kind of cor blimey Samuel Beckett, in which Brown conveyed her character's conflicting emotions beautifully." [...] Mark Wright of The Stage [...] praised Brown's acting as [...] "amazing", observing that she made the episode look [...] "effortless" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't think there's another soap actress out there who could carry this." [...] Virgin Media selected the episode as showcasing one of the best ever soap opera performances, deeming Brown's portrayal [...] "comic and endearing" [...] and the episode [...] "never less than riveting." ...|$|E
500|$|Called {{the other}} album {{masterpiece}} (along with Cyprus Avenue), [...] "Madame George" [...] is almost ten minutes long and {{tells of the}} mysterious madame [...] "in a corner playing dominoes in drag", among other things. It also has a setting of Cyprus Avenue in Belfast with impressionistic lyrics that give stream-of-conscious details that are seemingly unrelated. Erik Hage describes {{the effect of the}} sensory experience of the lyrics, the instrumentation and Morrison's impassioned vocals on the listener and the album as being [...] "like some kind of twilight state between sleeping and wakefulness", engaging the listener to project themselves into the spell of the song. Rolling Stones album reviewer wrote: [...] "The crowning touch is 'Madame George', a cryptic character study {{that may or may not}} be about an aging transvestite but that is certainly as heartbreaking a reverie <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> find in pop music." [...] Morrison has denied that the song is about a transvestite, as others, including Lester Bangs, have believed. The original title of the song is [...] "Madame Joy" [...] and Morrison later changed the title although he actually sings the words [...] "Madame Joy" [...] in the song. An earlier recording for Bang Records with slightly altered lyrics, backing singers, a much swifter tempo and a [...] "bizarrely inappropriate party atmosphere" [...] changes the tone considerably from the Astral Weeks recording.|$|E

GameSpot's review agreed with the high system requirements noting that [...] "the load times {{are one of the}} biggest gripes that we have, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> spend quite a bit of time waiting for a game to start up, even on high-end machines...also a bit demanding in the hardware department." ...|$|E

It {{is a very dangerous}} article, and use it <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> it always diminishes the vital energies in exact proportion to the quantity used - it may be slowly, but it is very sure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{argue that}} such a fund {{is part of an}} ongoing refusal by the Japanese {{government}} to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. California Congressman Mike Honda, speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that [...] "without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds. In fact, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> hear today, many Comfort Women returned the Prime Minister's letter of apology accompanying the monetary compensation, saying they felt the apology was artificial and disingenuous." ...|$|E

"That Maxwell {{should spend}} his efforts upon a romanticized, {{literary}} past {{is no less}} legitimate than the preoccupation of a Chirico with long sad vistas in towns that never were. Maxwell is entitled to his moon-drenched graveyards as Poe was to his misty mid-regions. The only question we are permitted to ask is, [...] "How far can nostalgia go without becoming the mutterings {{of an old man}} in his beer (or his bourbon) who likes to tell you, ad infinitum, about things that have ceased to interest anyone but himself, and himself only because he has nothing better to do?"

2500|$|... "You {{know that}} I have always {{considered}} that {{literature and the}} arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (Fleurs du mal) says everything, is clad, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even {{the knowledge of the}} French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron." ...|$|E
