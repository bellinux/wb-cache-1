25|$|In the Napoleonic era, {{artillery}} {{became one}} of the three main combat <b>arms,</b> <b>together</b> with infantry and cavalry. Field guns won many battlefield victories. In 1800 French armies employed about two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers. The number increased to as many as five guns per 1,000 by 1812 as the quality of foot soldiers diminished. Under Napoleon batteries usually included eight pieces and the 4-pounder was often employed in advance guards, divisional reserves and horse artillery batteries of the reserve. Frequently, batteries were made up of six cannons and two howitzers. At beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars, all armies attached 3- and 4-pounder cannons directly to the infantry units. They were supposed to be served by trained gunners but in reality they were often worked by infantrymen drafted from the ranks. Each infantry battalion had two 4-pounders attached to it and the guns were frequently called battalion pieces. Partly due to an overall lack of field guns, Napoleon removed the battalion pieces from infantry battalions and combined them into batteries. After his defeat at the Battle of Aspern-Essling in 1809, Napoleon reversed this policy and rearmed his infantry units with battalion pieces.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{artillery}} was {{the military}} arm least {{affected by the}} chaos accompanying the French Revolution. By the Napoleonic Wars, the French realized that artillery {{had become one of}} the three main combat <b>arms,</b> <b>together</b> with infantry and cavalry. On a number of battlefields, the artillery won the day. As early as the Battle of Wattignies in 1793 a Coalition observer remarked that the [...] "immense artillery" [...] of the French was the decisive factor. French armies employed approximately two artillery pieces per 1,000 soldiers in 1800. Napoleon aimed for a ratio of five guns per 1,000, but this goal was never reached. As the quality of foot soldiers fell, the ratio was increased so that there were three guns per 1,000 men at the Battle of Leipzig in 1813. The 6-inch howitzers were commonly found in the divisional and army artillery reserves. The ideal battery was made up of eight field pieces, with six cannons and two howitzers. Batteries with four cannons and two howitzers were also seen frequently. In 1805 there were 8,320 howitzers of all types available for military use.|$|E
