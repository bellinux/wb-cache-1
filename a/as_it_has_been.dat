5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{since the}} {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the {{population}} of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of {{the population}} belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer. Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> since the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine. The established church of England is the Church of England, which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when HenryVIII was unable to annul his divorce to the aunt of the king of Spain. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially incapacitate a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E

5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The station area at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking just like it did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{contains}} the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce. However, {{it is unclear}} how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.|$|E

5|$|Lepiota castaneidisca {{closely resembles}} L.cristata (with {{which it has}} {{commonly}} been confused), {{but it has a}} more rounded cap, lacks an umbo, and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown. L.cristata, which is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, L.castaneidisca is found in natural, undisturbed habitats. Other similar species in similar habitats with which L.castaneidisca could be confused include L.thiersii and L.neophana; in contrast to L.castaneidisca, both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores. The fruit bodies of L.thiersii appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under cypress. It usually lacks the reddish color {{in the center of the}} cap associated with L.castaneidisca, and its spores are not as long, with dimensions of 4.7–6.3 by 3.1–3.9μm. L.neophana is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the United States than L.castaneidisca, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reported from Ohio and Michigan in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from L.castaneidisca by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
