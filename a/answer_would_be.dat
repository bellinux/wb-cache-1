The author hinted that the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By {{the end of the}} book, he said that readers would have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
25|$|In Parliament, Prior-Palmer {{began his}} career by voting (along with many backbench Conservative MPs) against the large loan from the United States which the Labour {{government}} had negotiated {{after the end of}} Lend-Lease. However, these were the only dissenting votes he ever cast against the Conservative whip. In 1946 he argued for retaining conventional defence in addition to nuclear arms, because an <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found to the atomic bomb.|$|E
25|$|The {{presidency}} of Laurel understandably {{remains one of}} the most controversial in Philippine history. After the war, he would be denounced by the pro American sectors as a war collaborator or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation. However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence. When asked if he was pro American or pro Japanese, his <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pro Filipino.|$|E

25|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether Kiya ever used the rich funerary equipment that was prepared against her death. If her disappearance resulted from disgrace or exile, the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> no. On the other hand, if {{she died in}} good standing with Akhenaten, she probably would have received a lavish burial appropriate to her station. In the latter case, a likely site for her interment would be the Amarna Royal Tomb, which includes a suite of three chambers evidently used to house female members of Akhenaten's family. At least two and possibly {{as many as three}} different individuals were interred in this suite, including Akhenaten's daughter Meketaten, the only one whose name survives. Two of the chambers originally included painted plaster reliefs depicting Akhenaten, Nefertiti, certain of their daughters, and other mourners lamenting the deceased. Some Egyptologists have suggested that one of these scenes of mourning refers to Kiya, although no specific evidence supports this claim.|$|E

[...] Beacham, a mother of two infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid. Hey! No choice. Two pink babies asleep upstairs! No choice!" ...|$|E
500|$|While {{acknowledging}} the privileged position whites had under Smith, several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black Zimbabweans preferred him to Mugabe with hindsight. [...] "Smith's image improved inversely as Mugabe's plummeted," [...] Johnson wrote. [...] "When {{he walked the}} streets of Harare, Africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well." [...] "If you were to go to Harare today [...] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader—Smith or Mugabe—the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> almost unanimous," [...] Boynton asserted; [...] "And {{it would not be}} Mugabe." [...] Smith's death prompted strongly condemnatory reports in Zimbabwe's state media. The Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga accused Smith of being a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands and asserted that he would [...] "not be mourned or missed here by any decent person". Reactions from Zimbabweans on the street were mixed, however; according to Western journalists, many expressed sadness.|$|E

These included a defense attorney as saying [...] "ime will tell whether this activist conservative-majority Supreme Court is {{doing the right thing}} in moving back the clock on Miranda rights" [...] and a district attorney as saying [...] "Miranda had been broadened over the years far beyond what was necessary for its original goal of protecting suspects from [...] ... police culture has dramatically changed for the better in the 40-plus years since it came into being". A second defense attorney was quoted as saying that [...] "t's placing too much on a person who is already in an incredibly stressful situation.

500|$|The {{development}} team depicted {{reality in}} the world of Never 7 as subjective and relative rather than absolute. As such, for each route, that route's history is the only one Makoto knows and the only one that is real to him; the Curé syndrome only exists to him in the routes where it is mentioned. The bells were used as symbols for reality being relative, and were described by the development team as [...] "vague existences", saying that one cannot know if they exist or not. In the bad ending to Izumi's route, the bells, which [...] "should be fictional" [...] remain while something that should exist disappears; this was a metaphor for the idea that delusions become reality while reality becomes a delusion. The game's title comes from how Makoto is unable to escape the infinite loop and reach April 7, and how most of the seven characters die {{at some point during the}} game. It is also based on the belief that 7 is a lucky number. The game was designed to be open to speculation and multiple interpretations, a design philosophy that was carried over to later entries in the series and was part of what led to Infinity being chosen as the series title. One example of the openness to interpretation was that development team did not want to confirm or deny whether the game's world was connected to that of the Memories Off series, saying that while characters with similar names may appear, they wanted to leave the player to decide for themselves what the <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E

It is indeed no surprise to learn that this Italian-Chilean was himself snatched by the military in Buenos Aires and tortured.

2500|$|The Siege of Gaeta {{began on}} 26 February 1806. Masséna made a {{reconnaissance}} of the fortress and assigned General of Brigade Nicolas Bernard Guiot de Lacour {{to command the}} besiegers. Batteries were dug and armed with cannons obtained from the arsenals at Capua and Naples. The French siege lines were anchored on Monte Secco, which was [...] from the fortress, and on the more distant Plateau of Atratina. On 21 March, the French formally summoned Gaeta to surrender. Hesse replied that his <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> found in the breach, {{which is to say}} that the French would first have to batter a hole in the wall. But when the besiegers' guns opened fire they were quickly silenced by the 80 cannons that Hesse had trained on their new batteries. The French went back to work rebuilding their batteries, bringing up more cannons, and digging trenches closer to the defenses. On 5 April, Hesse refused another French summons. When the besiegers' cannons opened fire they were again rapidly put out of action by the superior weight of Gaeta's artillery.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Spanish possessive pronouns {{agree with}} neither {{the gender of}} the {{possessor}} nor that of the possession (but they do agree with number of the possession), except in the construct with de: de él, de ella ("of his, of hers"). In the third person, the possessive pronoun su(s) is used. Example: Su libro could mean either [...] "his book" [...] or [...] "her book", with {{the gender of the}} possessor being made clear from the context of the statement. Pronouns referring to people (or any noun) in Spanish have gender – él for [...] "him" [...] and ella for [...] "her". Only when referring to an indefinite antecedent is the neuter ello used, and since Spanish is a pro-drop language, it usually only appears in prepositional phrases, like para ello, [...] "for it". Grammatical person is inflected in verbs, so subject pronouns are generally used when necessary to make a distinction or add emphasis. For example, the verb vivir ("to live") may be conjugated in the third person as vive ("he/she/it lives") and be a complete sentence on its own. To make a distinction, one might say [...] "Ella vive en Madrid pero él vive en Barcelona" [...] – [...] "She lives in Madrid but he lives in Barcelona". If it is absolutely necessary to provide a subject when referring to an unnamed object, a demonstrative can be used instead of a pronoun: ¿Qué es eso? ("What is that?"). An acceptable <b>answer</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> Eso es un libro or Eso es una revista ("That's a book", [...] "That's a magazine"), with the genderless eso as subject in both cases.|$|E
