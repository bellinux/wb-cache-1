25|$|By {{the captain}} of the port in which you have cast anchor I have been courteously requested, as a soldier, and, above all, as a gentleman, to hold a conference with you, adding that you have advised him that war has been {{declared}} between our respective nations, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come for the purpose of occupying these Spanish islands.|$|E
2500|$|Kit Scheifele, {{who was the}} {{original}} editor of Boyer's book for the University of Arizona Press, noticed that Boyer had removed wording from his original introduction to the book that made it clear [...] "that the manuscript you have presented is not solely the first-person writing of Mrs. Earp, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> written a first-person account based on her memoirs and other material as well." [...] She asked him to restore the content, but Boyer ignored her request. [...] Karen Thure, who prepared the book for publication, questioned Boyer's sources from the beginning. She asked to see copies of the Clum manuscript more than once, and Boyer refused each time. [...] "Glenn {{put a lot of}} Glenn in there. Glenn's theories appeared as Josie's," [...] she said. [...] "I think it's a shame that anyone took I Married Wyatt Earp literally," [...] she says. [...] "It's somewhere between history and historical fiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Doughty advocates reappropriating pejoratives like 'morbid', and [...] {{wants to}} reverse the {{attitude}} that [...] "talking about death is deviant". She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He don't {{know what}} to suppose, sir, no more than myself. I told him jest wot passed yesterday, sir, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> said to me, [...] "Can you be here by seven in the morning?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> said to him, through me, [...] "Can you be here by ten in the morning?" [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I had said [...] "Yes" [...] to both. That's all, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She told us <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{always been}} very good to us, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been our {{guardian}} ever since we lost our mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{afterward}} <b>you</b> told us <b>that</b> {{your mother}} was a she-ape, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> never known your father?" [...] she asked incredulously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came about}} him. I wished {{to know whether}} he were alive, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been able to inform me: and where he was; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{not been able to}} inform me." ...|$|E
60|$|I hope I shall {{find you}} and Mrs. H., etc., well in London, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard {{something}} from this dilatory gentleman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Scatcherd, I {{know that}} there is brandy in the room at this moment, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been taking it within these two hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I {{told her}} exactly, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been most awfully kind, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I had placed {{the whole thing}} in your hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said {{yesterday}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been with Mr Slow, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{something to tell}} me. If you still wish to tell me anything, perhaps you can do so now." ...|$|R
6000|$|It gave me {{pleasure}} {{to be told that}} Mr. Keble's Dedication of his 'Praelectiones' had fallen in your way, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been struck by it.[205] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Vicomte," [...] Honora laughed, [...] "you must {{remember}} {{that you are in}} America, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come here to study our manners and customs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} {{got to say}} that you find late hours don't agree with you, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made up your mind to cut it altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to say that I am {{interested}} in the case, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all my good wishes. I do not like to offer pecuniary help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} you to say, Mr. Pendril, that my father's {{brother had}} sent his written orders to London, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a copy. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> preserved it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He told {{me there}} was a rich fellow over in England who was crazy about <b>you</b> and <b>had</b> asked <b>you</b> to marry him, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> turned him down." ...|$|R
6000|$|Courtland's face darkened. [...] "He did--and {{he further}} told me, Miss Dows, {{that he himself}} was your suitor, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> refused him because of the {{objections}} of your people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply {{that she}} {{is in love with}} you, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{encouraged}} her in her affection; you need not contradict me, she tells me all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I know. You mustn't think me {{so stupid}} as all that. It is a mortifying truth that I like you, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{no use for}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it, I deduce it. How do I {{know that}} you have been getting {{yourself}} very wet lately, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a most clumsy and careless servant girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] Arranmore replied, lightly. [...] "I {{was hoping}} that your visit had no object at all, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been good enough just to look me up.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the ground}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a {{rejected}} suitor for the elder lady's hand, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> uttered threats against her father, who, {{so far as}} he knows, has no other enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At least I know to {{what kind}} of verses they all lead,' said the Doctor; 'and I am sure they led <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> more <b>and</b> {{brighter}} hours than you now remember.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I shall hope to hear {{very soon}} that the workmen have [...] "broken through," [...] <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{been in the}} state apartments, and that {{upholstery}} measurements have come off.|$|E
6000|$|LADY BRITOMART. Never mind why: you shouldn't have: that's all. To {{think of}} all that [indicating the town] being yours! <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> kept it to {{yourself}} all these years! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that gentlemanly creature, Dombey? Do {{you know}} that you are married to him, Edith, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a {{settlement}} and a position, and a carriage, and I don't know what?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{think about}} those things to-day," [...] she replied. [...] "You may take it that I am tired <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> business. <b>You</b> know my address. May I be favoured with yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yet I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{a message}} for me, White Man, for not long ago a certain {{wandering}} witch-doctor who came here told me to expect <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> words to say to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{not treated}} your aunts rightly by not consulting them about your intercourse with the Whites, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> very properly resolved {{to tell them}} all. I hope you did so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, don't say {{afterwards}} that I did not warn you. My dear Crosse, I {{assure you}} that you are being misled, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not really got a leg to stand upon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true {{that the}} prince has honoured me thus, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been pleased to approve of his choice," [...] she said, lifting her eyebrows. [...] "What of it, O King?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear lady! {{pardon me}} for {{reminding}} you again, {{that this is}} a free country, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no claim whatever to investigate Miss Silvester's proceedings after she has left your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should have}} known you," [...] said Deronda, mournfully. [...] "The outside change is not great. I should have seen at once <b>that</b> it was <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone through some great sorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{she looks}} fairly radiant," [...] cried Edith, seizing her cousin's hand. [...] "It's quite wonderful, Honora; nobody would ever guess <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were from the}} West, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> spent the whole summer in St. Louis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it flashed upon me {{immediately}} that I had named a day, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been {{kind enough to}} remember it. But I did not think you came to London till the March winds were over." ...|$|R
