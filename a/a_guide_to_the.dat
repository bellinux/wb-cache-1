[...] As thus put, the question admits of but one reply. But as thus put, it assumes the point at issue. We contend that, as appetite is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> all <b>the</b> lower creation--as it is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infant--as it is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> invalid--as it is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> differently-placed races of men--and as it is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> for every adult who leads a healthful life; it may safely be inferred that it is <b>a</b> good <b>guide</b> for childhood.

An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books, just before the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was released.

5|$|St Deiniol's is {{no longer}} in use; in 2006, <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> churches of Anglesey noted that no {{services}} had been held for a number of years, and added that ivy was growing across the building. The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll, served by St Mary's, Llanfairpwll. As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for £50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it {{could be used as a}} studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained.|$|E
5|$|The family Picidae was {{introduced}} by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contents of the British Museum published in 1820. The phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, {{the relationship of the}} picine genera has been largely clarified, and it was determined that the Antillean piculet is a surviving offshoot of proto-woodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of Picidae, which seems to have originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae is returned as paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Grinsell became a Pilot Officer in the Air Photographic Branch of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1941. During he conflict, he was stationed in Egypt, where he spent time studying the archaeological remains of Ancient Egypt and visiting all of the pyramids near to Cairo. Based on these experiences, at his own expense he published Egyptian Pyramids in 1947. Designed as <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sites, it was (as Grinsell acknowledged) heavily reliant on the earlier plans of Egyptologists but with additional aerial photographs that Grinsell had obtained through his involvement with the RAF. The book was largely ignored by Britain's Egyptological establishment.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{contents}} of each chapter, musical notations were added before the chapter number. In School Rumble, chapters {{marked with a}} sharp sign(♯) concern the main plot development focusing around Tenma and Harima, while side stories dealing with supporting characters are indicated by a flat sign(♭). The one exception to this pattern in the first series is the chapter that appears in Shōnen Magazine Wonder, which uses the natural sign(♮). School Rumble Z uses the natural sign for every chapter. The manga volumes of School Rumble contain original bonus chapters that use no musical notation; these are normally one page in length, but the seventh volume spreads its bonus chapter over several pages with each page telling a self-contained story.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN has {{published}} ten books {{based on its}} programming; these contain original material and text taken from interview transcripts. The first C-SPAN book, C-SPAN: America's Town Hall, was published in 1988. Other C-SPAN books include: Gavel to Gavel: A C-SPAN Guide to Congress; Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb?, <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grave sites of U.S. presidents; Abraham Lincoln - Great American Historians On Our Sixteenth President, {{a collection of essays}} based on C-SPAN interviews with American historians; and The Supreme Court, which features biographies and interviews with past Supreme Court judges together with commentary from legal experts. Five books have been drawn from the former Booknotes program: Booknotes: Life Stories; Booknotes: On American Character; Booknotes: Stories from American History; Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading, Writing and the Power of Ideas, the latter a compilation of short monologues taken from the transcripts of Lamb's interviews; and a companion book to the series on Tocqueville, Traveling Tocqueville's America: A Tour Book.|$|E
5|$|The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts is <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fictional Harry Potter universe, {{written by}} David Colbert. It explores the {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Colbert conceived the idea for The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while quizzing his nephew and nieces about the mythological references in the novels. He later wrote the book while teaching a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. The book was published in March 2001, without approval from Rowling, and has since received positive reviews from critics. An updated version of The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books.|$|E

5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. <b>A</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 {{made no mention of}} peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, and some of the locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over this responsibility. These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as <b>a</b> <b>guide</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E
