50|$|A {{balanced}} chemical leavening such sodium bicarbonate, {{along with}} an <b>acidifier</b> is another common ingredient. When reacted together, the <b>acidifier</b> {{has the ability to}} release all of the carbon dioxide from the sodium bicarbonate. A variety of acidifiers can be used, including potassium bitartrate, tartaric acid, and disodium phosphate. The type of <b>acidifier</b> used depends on when the preferred release of CO2 is. If the release would be most beneficial when the batter is forming, citric acid would be ideal because it is fast acting. The amount of <b>acidifier</b> depends on which agent, such as sodium bicarbonate, is used because they have varying neutralization points.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acidifiers,</b> such as {{organic acids}} or their salts, {{are used to}} prevent {{microbial}} degradation of raw materials or finished feeds, especially under poor storage conditions (e.g. high moisture content, high levels of contamination with molds). Moreover, <b>acidifiers</b> may improve growth performance through establishment of low gastrointestinal pH conditions which support endogenous digestive enzymes and reduce undesired gut microorganisms. Many dietary <b>acidifiers</b> are based on propionic acid, formic acid, lactic acid and others, either as single components or in combination. Some <b>acidifiers</b> also contain inorganic acids (e.g. phosphoric acid).|$|R

50|$|An excess <b>acidifier</b> is also added, {{however it}} isn’t used in {{combination}} with the sodium bicarbonate. Instead it lowers the batter pH to facilitate the starch gelatinization and maintain the egg white protein foam volume in the baking cake. At a lower pH, the egg white proteins are able to entrap more air during both preparation and baking. The optimal pH for the batter is between 5.5 and 6.8. It also helps to create a whiter cake, which is more desirable to consumers. It is typical that the excess <b>acidifier</b> is the same as that used to react with the balanced chemical leavener.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} supplementation of <b>acidifiers</b> in diets for broiler chicks on {{performance}} na intestinal morphology was valuated. A total of 2, 112 birds was allocated to eight diets, with six replicates, constituted {{by the addition}} of antibiotics or <b>acidifiers</b> blenders according to the phase development (from 1 to 7, from 8 to 21 and from 22 to 35 days old), in different composition: control - positive = bacitracin methylene disalicylate (BMD - 55 ppm) + colistin (10 ppm); control-negative = without antibiotic growth promoters or acidifiers; blend A = 8, 4. 5 and 2. 5 kg/t; blend B = 10, 6 and 3 kg/t; blend C = 4, 2 and 1 kg/t; blend C = 3, 3 and 1 kg/t; blend D = 5, 2. 5 and 1 kg/t and blend D = 3, 3 and 1 kg/t. There was a general benefit with the use of <b>acidifiers</b> on feed conversion, which was similar to the use of antibiotics, except for blend B. Small intestine of birds of control-negative was heavier and had shorter villi height. The deeper Lieberkuhn crypt depth was not altered by the antibiots and by great part of the <b>acidifiers.</b> The use of <b>acidifiers</b> was efficient in maintenance of performance and morphological conditions of small intestines of broilers chicks, similar to the benefit of the use of antibiotics, except for Blend B.

40|$|One-hundred-twelve isolants of Listeria monocytogenes cultured from {{clinical}} and nonclinical sources were examined for hemolytic activity {{by means of}} the CAMP phenomenon and tested for acidification of xylose and rhamnose. The reactions of the isolants were noted and correlated with the pathogenicity of the organisms. All of the CAMP-negative (nonhemolytic) isolants were apathogenic, and {{all but one of the}} CAMP-positive (hemolytic) isolants were pathogenic. All xylose-acidifying isolating isolants were apathogenic, but not all apathogenic isolants were xylose <b>acidifiers.</b> All pathogenic isolants but one were rhamnose <b>acidifiers,</b> but not all rhamnose <b>acidifiers</b> were pathogenic. The pattern of hemolysis, rhamnose acidification, and non-acidification of xylose is associated with pathogenic L. monocytogenes; departure from this pattern is associated with nonpathogenic Listeria, which otherwise share the properties of L. monocytogenes. These in vitro tests should prove useful in screening the apathogenic isolants whose {{clinical and}} epidemiological significance should be carefully assessed...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY – Physiological {{additives}} {{are those}} that help the normal development of physiological functions of animals or that make up for their deficiencies. Among these, <b>acidifiers,</b> Yucca schidigera extracts and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) have to be considered. Acidification is crucial in young animals, which cannot secrete enough hydrochloric acid for a correct protein digestion. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} inorganic-based <b>acidifiers</b> are the most appropiate to achieve not only a regular digestion, but improvements in health and performances. Yucca extracts are used as dietary supplements for any animal species, primarily for ammonia and odor control, thus improving environmental conditions and, consequently, health and performances. In ruminants, Yucca extracts improve nitrogen utilization through their antibacterial and antiprotozoal function...|$|R
50|$|From 1926 {{the factory}} was closed {{down to a}} reserve status, under a caretaker. In 1935 the factory's plant {{was moved to the}} Footscray and Maribyrnong {{factories}} in Melbourne, and the factory was handed over to the Department of the Interior in January 1936. In June 1936 the idea was floated that the Post Master General's Department could use a building for its frequency measuring equipment, using the chimney and water tower to mount aerials. The Department's Radio Broadcasting Branch, Wireless Experimental Section, occupied various buildings from 1937, including the <b>Acidifier</b> House and the Fitter's shop.|$|E
50|$|As a food additive, {{it has the}} E number E351. It is used as acidity {{regulator}} or <b>acidifier</b> for use in, for example, canned vegetables, soups, sauces, fruit products and soft drinks. It also acts as an antioxidant and as a food flavor. It is an important compound in the transport of nitrate from the roots of a plant to {{the leaves of the}} plant. Potassium malate is the salt that transports from the leaves to the root. At the root the potassium maleate oxidizes to potassium carbonate, then is converted to potassium nitrate by soil nitrate and transported back to the leaves.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Colmslie Migrant Hostel, the <b>Acidifier</b> House {{was used}} for {{accommodation}}, and as a dining room and kitchen. The Engineer's Office and Fitter's Shop became a baggage store and the Assistant Manager's quarters, and the Winch House became a tool room. The Evaporator House was used for accommodation, ablutions and recreation, and the Alcohol Still house was also used for accommodation. The Engine Room was used for accommodation and recreation, and the Boiler House {{was used as a}} laundry. The Lime Slacking Store became an office, and the Excise Office, Fertiliser House and Painter's Shop building (extended to the south around 1949) became a store.|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of acidic substances to brown street heroin {{to facilitate the}} solubility of diamorphine in the injection preparation process is commonplace amongst UK injectors. Knowledge of the chemistry behind this process supports the need for this stage in the injection preparation process. It is currently illegal, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, section 9 A, to supply <b>acidifiers</b> and other paraphernalia to injectors in the UK. In the current climate of evidence-based practice, any consideration given to changing the law would look for evidence to illustrate that the paraphernalia was necessary. Although the theory behind the use of <b>acidifiers</b> suggests they are essential, no previous work using street heroin has actually been reported to illustrate this fact. Anecdotal information has found that drug users are being told by some service providers that the {{addition of}} acids is unnecessary. It is important that drugs services give credible information to their clients. The provision of inaccurate information in one area {{may lead to a}} lack of trust of all information provided. The small study reported here investigated, under controlled laboratory conditions, the effects of citric and ascorbic acids (vitamin C) on injections prepared with brown heroin, in order to demonstrate the need for <b>acidifiers</b> in the injection preparation process...|$|R
25|$|<b>Acidifiers,</b> {{most often}} lactic or citric acid, can impart a tangy or tart flavor note, extend shelf-life, tenderize fresh meat or help with protein {{denaturation}} and moisture release in dried meat.

50|$|As {{described}} above, {{baking powder}} is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, {{a number of}} kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders. Vinegar (dilute acetic acid), especially white vinegar, is also a common <b>acidifier</b> in baking; for example, many heirloom chocolate cake recipes call for a tablespoon or two of vinegar. Where a recipe already uses buttermilk or yogurt, baking soda can be used without cream of tartar (or with less). Alternatively, lemon juice can be substituted {{for some of the}} liquid in the recipe, to provide the required acidity to activate the baking soda. The main variable with the use of these kitchen acids is the rate of leavening.|$|E
50|$|The former Acetate of Lime Factory, now {{a part of}} the Hans Continental Smallgoods factory, is {{accessed}} from Colmslie Road.

Elements of the Acetate of Lime Factory that still exist on the eastern side of the internal roadway include: the Lime Slacking Store and the Lime Slacking House; the Excise Office, Fertilizer House and Painters' Shop building; the Evaporator House and Alcohol Still House; the Engine Room; the Boiler House and Chimney; and a small latrine block. To the west of the internal road are: the ground floor of the <b>Acidifier</b> House; the Winch House, and the Engineers' Office and Fitters' Shop. To the north of the Engineers' Office and Fitters' shop are two huts that were introduced as extra migrant accommodation.|$|E
50|$|Ingredients in {{squashes}} and cordials {{have evolved}} over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an <b>acidifier</b> such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh {{for quite a long}} time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.|$|E
