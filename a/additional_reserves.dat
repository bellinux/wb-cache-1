25|$|The 6C 2500 Coloniale was a staff car {{version of}} the third series 6c 2500. It had been {{commissioned}} in 1938 by the Italian Ministry of Defense, for military use in the Italian colonies. Two prototypes 6C 2500 Coloniale were manufactured in 1939. One of them was shipped to Italian East Africa, where Giambattista Guidotti had been instructed to conduct testing in the harsh operational conditions. The car {{was the first to}} be manufactured using technology developed by the renowned Carrozzeria Touring, the Superleggera. The car had two spare wheels, a fuel tank of 120 litres and four <b>additional</b> <b>reserves</b> with a capacity of 70 litres of gasoline. In addition there was a locking differential, engaged from the dashboard by the driver. Regular production started in 1941, and the first batch of 150 vehicles was delivered between 1941 and 1942; afterwards production stopped due to the war events Total production amounted to 150 series cars plus two prototypes.|$|E

2500|$|Fractional-reserve banking ordinarily {{functions}} smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at {{any given}} time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds. [...] However, during a bank run or a generalized financial crisis, demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank {{will be forced to}} raise <b>additional</b> <b>reserves</b> to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the interbank lending market or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in short-term loans. If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves. Thus the fear of a bank run can actually precipitate the crisis.|$|E

In order to fully estimate the hydrocarbon potentials in Nigerian Niger Delta Region, a clear understanding of the reserve geology and production history should be acknowledged.
