5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{had hoped}} to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Barre {{also sought}} to {{eradicate}} the importance of clan (qabil) affiliation within government and civil society. The inevitable first question that Somalis <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> another when they met was, 'What is your clan?'. When this was considered anathema {{to the purpose of}} a modern state, Somalis began to pointedly ask, 'What is your ex-clan?'. Barre outlawed this question and a broad range of other activities classified as clanism. Informers reported qabilists to the government, leading to arrests and imprisonment.|$|E

The newspaper also alleged that Oaten had engaged in 'three-in-a-bed' sex sessions with two male prostitutes.

In 1958 the Buffetts' third child, Peter Andrew, was born. Buffett operated five partnerships that year. In 1959, the company grew to six partnerships and Buffett met future partner Charlie Munger. By 1960, Buffett operated seven partnerships. He <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> of his partners, a doctor, to find ten other doctors {{willing to invest}} $10,000 each in his partnership.

25|$|In the Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance (1959), the {{investigators}} Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith {{asked students to}} spend an hour doing tedious tasks; e.g. turning pegs a quarter-turn, at fixed intervals. The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid twenty dollars ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were not asked {{to speak with the}} imposter-subject.|$|E

He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. At 3:20a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{football}} club Juventus F.C. derived its famous black-and-white striped kits from Notts County. Juventus {{have played in}} black and white striped shirts, and with white or sometimes black shorts, since 1903.

25|$|On 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court {{declared}} Indira Gandhi's {{election to}} the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by her 1971 opponent, Raj Narain (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from Raebareli), alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning. The court ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. According to constitution, the Prime Minister must {{be a member of}} either the Lok Sabha (the lower house in the Parliament of India) or a member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> of her colleagues in government, Mr. Ashoke Kumar Sen to defend her in court.|$|E

Seventy-two hours later, Davison's plan was submitted to the White House.
