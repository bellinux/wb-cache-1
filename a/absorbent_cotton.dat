Some smoking pipe cleaners are made conical or tapered so that one end is thick and one end thin.

He argued that such swabs would be no better than a charcoal-coated type previously described by Bartlett and Hughes (1969) which were only slightly less lethal to Streptococcus pyogenes than untreated wool swabs. Several authors have described factors that might contribute to bacterial loss or in-activation when a swab is used for sampling. It is known, for example, that the technique of swabbing is important (Mozziconacci et al., 1960; Ross, 19716) and that the isolation rate of organisms is considerably increased if more than one swab is used.

The scent identification was done by two specially trained police German shepherds. These canines had routinely performed scent identification line-ups as part of criminal investigation procedures.

40|$|During {{the last}} years, the third {{generation}} of bio fuels has been arousing more and more interest. The so-called ‘Single cell oils’ (SCO), oils produced by micro-organisms: yeasts, algae, fungi and bacteria, are well known in this context. The traditional downstream process, nowadays used in feed and food industry, runs {{up to more than}} 50 % of the total production cost of these SCO. This {{is one of the main}} limiting factors to make them commercially attractive for the production of bio fuels. Cryptococcus curvatus, the used model organism, is a yeast with industrial potential because it can grow and accumulate lipid (up to 50 %) on a very broad range of substrates. Traditionally yeast cells are harvested by centrifugation and further dewatered with a combination of different techniques (e. g. rotary vacuum drum, fluidized bed,…). Our research is focused on the design and development of a dewatering facility using compaction, filtration and capillarity. Centrifuged yeast (dry weight 20 %) is enveloped in two layers of cloth: a filter cloth with pore size 5 μm and a <b>cotton</b> <b>absorbent</b> cloth. This envelop is compressed using a series of consecutive roller pairs to expel excess water. The pressure is enhanced gradual by diminishing the spacing in the roller pairs.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{consists of}} four papers that {{have been published in}} scientific journals. Study n. 1 The need to recover evidence from water is quite common in criminal investigation. The article deals with the possibility to collect human scent from such objects and with the ability of specially trained dogs to match such scent samples with scent samples collected from detained suspects. During an experiment, designed as a blind one, it has been proved, that human scent can survive on submerged objects and can be later used for scent identification. Study n. 2 To collect odors the Czech Republic Police use special fabric sorbents manufactured under the registered mark ARATEX. Before use the fabric sorbent is treated by water vapor sterilization. After the scent identification the sorbent is destroyed. The goal {{of the study was to}} verify if the vapor sterilization is effective enough to remove human scent that has already penetrated into the sorbent structure or in other words if the sorbent can be exposed to vapor sterilization and then used again. Specially trained dogs were used to match starting odors with target odors in the line-ups. The results showed that dogs are able to correctly match human odors even after they have being exposed to vapor sterilization. Study n. 3 The purpose of the study was to determine the temperature at which the human scent is degraded so that a dog would not be able to identify it. In contrast to expectations, eight dogs used in the experiment almost flawlessly identified human scents from five scent donors exposed to temperatures of 100 °C, 200 °C, 300 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C. Only two of the dogs were able to identify 5 of 15 scent samples exposed to 900 °C. No dog identified a scent exposed to 1000 °C. Our study verified heat survivability of human scent far beyond existing expectations. Study n. 4 We tested the hypothesis that if odor fallout (the release of a human odor onto an untouched object) in human subjects exists, then holding a hand above an absorbent will produce a detectable scent which will be subsequently matched in a detection test by trained dogs. Scents were collected from seven males to sterile <b>cotton</b> <b>absorbent</b> squares. The left hand was used to get the control scent and the right hand served as the target scent.
