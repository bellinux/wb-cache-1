25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same <b>angular</b> <b>rate,</b> although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead.|$|E

2500|$|It {{took some}} time for the astronomical {{community}} to accept the reality and the scale of tidal effects. [...] But eventually {{it became clear that}} three effects are involved, when measured in terms of mean solar time. Beside the effects of perturbational changes in Earth's orbital eccentricity, as found by Laplace and corrected by Adams, there are two tidal effects (a combination first suggested by Emmanuel Liais). [...] First there is a real retardation of the Moon's <b>angular</b> <b>rate</b> of orbital motion, due to tidal exchange of angular momentum between Earth and Moon. [...] This increases the Moon's angular momentum around Earth (and moves the Moon to a higher orbit with a lower orbital speed). Secondly there is an apparent increase in the Moon's <b>angular</b> <b>rate</b> of orbital motion (when measured in terms of mean solar time). This arises from Earth's loss of angular momentum and the consequent increase in length of day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this work, {{we present}} a powerful, albeit simple {{position}} control approach for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) targeting specifically multicopter systems. Exploiting the differential flatness of {{four of the six}} outputs of multicopters, namely position and yaw, we show that the remaining outputs of pitch and roll need not be controlled states, but rather just need to be known. Instead of the common approach of having multiple cascaded control loops (position- velocity-acceleration/attitude- <b>angular</b> <b>rates),</b> the proposed method employs an outer control loop based on dynamic inversion, which directly commands <b>angular</b> <b>rates</b> and thrust. The inner control loop then reduces to a simple proportional controller on the <b>angular</b> <b>rates.</b> As a result, not only does this combination allow for higher bandwidth compared to common control approaches, but also eliminates many mathematical operations (only one trigonometric function is called), speeding up the necessary processing especially on embedded systems. This approach assumes a reliable state estimation framework, which we are able to provide with through previous work. As a result, with this work, we provide the missing elements necessary for a complete approach on autonomous navigation of MAVs. I...|$|R
