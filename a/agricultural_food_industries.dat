The aims of the association are to promote, internationally and nationally, agricultural library science and documentation, {{as well as the}} professional interests of agricultural librarians and documentalists. The term 'agriculture' is interpreted in its widest sense, so as to include forestry, agricultural engineering, veterinary science, fisheries, food and nutrition, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>food</b> <b>industries.</b> The Association's membership of 600 is drawn from sixty countries and comprises agricultural research institutions, international organizations, professional associations and individual members. The Association produces a quarterly bulletin in English, French, Spanish and German covering news in the field of bibliography and documentation of agriculture and allied subjects. IAALD has also produced a Primer for agricultural libraries, reports on the seven World Congresses of Agricultural Librarians and Documentalists as well as proceedings of IAALD meetings. A milestone in the advancement of agricultural information and transfer and improved communications between agricultural universities and information centres worldwide has been the recently completed Agricultural Information Resource Centres: a world directory 1990. It represents the culmination of four years' work by US-based World Directory Working Group of IAALD. The Directory includes 3971 information resource centres that have agriculture-related collections and/or information services. Most of the information was obtained d directly from questionnaires completed by the institutions concerned, though {{in the case of the}} Soviet Union a Russian directory, The libraries of the agri-industrial complex in the USSR was used. Each institution was asked to provide its name, acronym, former name, year founded, type, postal address, actual location, name and telephone number of the head of the resource centre, fax and telex numbers, number of professional and other staff, size of collection, number 0 journal subscriptions, main language of the collection and set vices, subjects and specie strengths, unique in-house databases, database vendors used and loan service and photocopy policies.

Recovery of these metals from their aqueous solutions has emerged as an exciting area of research {{as a result of}} increasing or fluctuating prices of metals (eg, precious metals), limited availability of their deposits, and the ever-increasing demand and time- and energy-consuming processes needed to mine metal deposits. This review will summarize the various sources of metals, the available biowastes of the <b>agricultural</b> and <b>food</b> <b>industries,</b> and preparation methods for biosorbents and biochars from biowastes. We will focus on metal and heavy metal removal and recovery from waste and wastewater, methods for metal recovery, pretreatment and modification of biosorbents and biochars for enhanced metal sequestration, and strategies to provide stability to biosorbents and biochars to maximize resource recovery. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Sustainability {{relies on}} the environmental, social and {{economical}} systems: the three pillars of sustainability. The social sustainability mostly advocates the people’s welfare, health, safety, and quality of life. In the <b>agricultural</b> <b>food</b> <b>industry,</b> the aspects of social sustainability, such as consumer health and safety have gained substantial attention due to the frequent cases of food-borne diseases. The food-borne diseases due to the food degradation, chemical contamination and adulteration of food products pose {{a serious threat to}} the consumer’s health, safety, and quality of life. To ensure the consumer’s health and safety, it is essential to develop an efficient system which can address these critical social issues in the food distribution networks. This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>food</b> to prevent the distribution of hazardous and adulterated food products. The different aspects regarding implementation of the proposed system in food chains are analyzed and a feasible integrated solution is proposed.

Specific areas of interest are small changes in the density of materials which consist of low atomic number elements, and the use of scattered photon information. Specific results from both the linear attenuation and the full photon history approaches are presented, their usefulness for X-ray imaging, and application areas are discussed. The simulation approaches concentrate on the detection of perspex, a soft plastic, and cellulose in a water environment.

40|$|Hydrogen gas can be {{produced}} by conventional methods such as thermo-chemical gasification, pyrolysis, solar gasification and supercritical conversion. Hydrogen productions through biological methods are an attractive and alternate method for the replacement of fossil fuel in future. In this review, the major biological processes discussed for hydrogen production are bio-photolysis of water by algae, dark fermentation, photo–fermentation of organic materials and the sequential dark and photo-fermentation processes. Major constraints in dark and photo-fermentative hydrogen production include the raw material cost, lower hydrogen yield and rate of hydrogen production. To overcome those constraints, intensive research works are strongly recommended {{to be carried out}} on the advancement of these processes. The review showed effective utilization of low cost substrate such as <b>agricultural,</b> <b>food</b> <b>industry</b> wastes and effluents such as diary industry wastewater for hydrogen production with inexpensive energy generation and simultaneous wastewater treatment.
