The song was recorded alongside {{the rest of}} their second studio album Happy to You (2012) {{during the second half of}} 2011.

They felt they could [...] "plan the process more", which included inviting the Swedish Army drum corps to play military drums on several tracks, such as [...] "The Wave". Karlsson told Billboard that his favorite part of the song occurs during the second verse, in which all band members <b>are</b> <b>hitting</b> the drums simultaneously. [...] "We hit anything we could hit at the same time ... and it sounded kind of cool", he said. Nils Törnqvist is credited for playing the drums, while David Lindberg, Jonathan Lundberg and Claes Malmberg played the military drums. Swedish musician Gustav Ejstes of band Dungen played the autoharp, and the band provided additional instruments, arrangement and programming. Niklas Flyckt mixed the track at Robotberget, Miike Snow's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

He also refused to appear in an advertisement for Cricket Australia sponsor KFC, saying: [...] "The problem for me is that KFC and Cricket Australia <b>are</b> <b>hitting</b> parents where they’re vulnerable.

2500|$|Cinematographer Daniel Mindel {{stated that}} The Force Awakens would use real {{locations}} and scale models over computer-generated imagery {{to make it}} aesthetically similar to the original Star Wars trilogy.

[...] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original Star Wars. To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop that was developed by Disney Research, created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.|$|E
