25|$|B {{were very}} strong characters, {{with a very}} {{specific}} type of humor and very loyal fans, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in Daria, while {{we were trying to}} establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there is really no point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't a great movie but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. <b>And,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E

60|$|The Swedes came to Delaware Bay. They {{stopped for}} a while at Cape Henlopen; <b>and</b> then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> sailed up the Delaware, when things soon began to be very disagreeable between {{themselves}} and the Dutch, who were there before them.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} to be done," [...] Ned said, when the laugh was over, [...] "is {{to look for a}} couple of long springy saplings, and to make bows <b>and</b> arrows. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> will not carry far, but we might knock down any small game we come across." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! that {{is another}} matter, Godfrey. You see a camel can go three days without water easily enough, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> would carry skins of water for the travellers." ...|$|E
60|$|The miller {{answered}} {{for them}} all, <b>and</b> said that <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> would come. 'But you'll step down again {{between now and}} then?' he inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two of the pursuers who had outpaced {{the others}} crept up to him--lank, lean men of {{not more than}} thirty years of age. They had {{stabbing}} spears in their hands, such as are used at close quarters, <b>and</b> these <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> did not throw. One of them gained a little on the other.|$|R

60|$|Annie {{asked him}} to please to be more careful, for {{how did he know}} that one of the {{servants}} might not be sweeping the front porch, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> would look in at the windows.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{absolutely}} starving," [...] {{she said as}} they drove off. [...] "I have been in since eleven this morning; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> only called the band for half-past. They are such damned fools: they drive me mad." ...|$|E
60|$|At noon, in {{accordance}} with the universal custom at the mines, they threw down their tools and went up to the hut for an hour's rest <b>and</b> refreshment. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> discussed while they dined, and hoped largely! but their jaws were more active than their tongues, and the moment the hour was completed they returned vigorously to work.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> were {{received}} with mingled joy <b>and</b> reproof. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> also, <b>they</b> {{were forbidden to}} go near the pool again--though this prohibition was afterwards removed, and our hero ultimately became a first-rate swimmer and diver.|$|R
6000|$|He {{sat down}} and puzzled over these things a good while, but kept muttering, [...] "It's no use; I can't {{understand}} it. They don't tally right, and yet I'll swear the names and dates are right, <b>and</b> so <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> OUGHT to tally. I never labeled one of these thing carelessly in my life. There is a most extraordinary mystery here." ...|$|R
60|$|But no one {{had seen}} Harry. In fact, this company, with the {{accumulated}} proceeds of a week's sumac gathering, had come from a portion of the county many miles from Crooked Creek, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> could bring no news to Kate.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quito so. Well, we {{know that}} the {{original}} price of each share was ten shillings, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> must have dropped with a flood in the mine, so that these figures must mean that the price yesterday was four shillings and nine-pence, or thereabouts.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Decidedly {{this was}} bad form, and Mr Evans, pursing up {{his lips and}} raising his eyebrows, was silent. 'That's the worst of these half-educated people,' he said to himself; 'they get some idea in their heads which they don't understand, <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> do idiotic things....' ...|$|E
60|$|The Scotch {{families}} were having their mid-day meal around the camp-fires, when the Switzers arrived <b>and</b> introduced themselves. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> were made heartily welcome by Mr Sutherland, who acted as spokesman for his countrymen.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right; but {{the ones}} with the numbers calling for the big prizes are lying flat in the box where nobody can get them. If you should accuse the man of {{cheating}} he would turn the whole thing upside down, <b>and</b> then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> could be found. Here comes a fellow who I know is cappin' for that fakir. Watch how he does it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Red Riding Hoodwinked", the Big Bad Wolf teams up with Sylvester Cat {{in which}} they both play [...] "Grandma" [...] to get their {{respective}} prey-Red Riding Hood <b>and</b> Tweety Bird. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> lose as usual.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I like to {{hear you}} talk about it," [...] said Marian. [...] "I always try to make people talk shop to me, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> always repay me by trying to keep on {{indifferent}} topics, of which I know as much--or as little--as they." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Dingwall {{elevated}} his eyebrows. [...] "The large {{property at}} stake of course rendered the most satisfactory proofs of it necessary. His {{father had died}} only a month previous, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> were seeking the presumptive heir, the so-called 'Captain John Dornton'--your man--when they made the discovery of his death." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were several}} roads {{at this point}} <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> took the wrong one.

6000|$|... 'You {{might have}} been misled by the beams snapping. I've been looking at 'em. They were dry-rotted through <b>and</b> through. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> as <b>they</b> broke, they would make a noise just like a gun.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> Gaff's re-appearance {{with his}} son in his arms was greeted with heartfelt and vociferous cheers; <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> when <b>they</b> were hauled on board, and Gaff handed Billy to the skipper, in order that he might the more {{conveniently}} wring {{a little of the}} superabundant water from his garments, another and a still more hearty cheer was given; but Gaff checked it rather abruptly by raising himself and saying sternly-- ...|$|R
60|$|To my surprise, Bembo {{was at the}} helm; {{but there}} being so few to stand there now, they told me, he had offered to take his turn with the rest, {{at the same time}} heading the watch; <b>and</b> to this, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> made no objection.|$|R
60|$|But {{nothing would}} do; for he screamed and cried all {{day for a}} water-baby, to come and drive away the monsters; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> {{did not try to}} find one, because they did not believe in them, and were {{thinking}} of nothing but Bumpsterhausen's blue follicles; having, as usual, set the cart before the horse, and taken the effect for the cause.|$|E
60|$|Both men now {{understood}} that treachery {{was in the}} wind, and that a night attack was highly probable; <b>and,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>they</b> felt desperately anxious to jump up and fly back to the camp to warn their comrades--for their only fear was a surprise. The half-breeds being far more numerous than the Indians, and well entrenched, {{there could be no}} fear for them if prepared.|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew that}} they meant her, {{and she tried to}} explain that she just [...] had to promise, and that if they had been in her place they would [...] have promised too; <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>they</b> could do as they pleased about [...] keeping her word, but she was going to keep it, anyway, and never, [...] never, never eat another piece of turkey either at Thanksgiving or at [...] Christmas.|$|E
