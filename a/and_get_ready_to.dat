Lauren Hoffman from Cosmopolitan lauded the episode for its [...] "amazingly effective storytelling" [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between Meredith and Alex.

500|$|PT-32, {{which had}} only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what {{appeared}} to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him. He jettisoned his fuel drums so he could increase speed and run from it. He ordered his crew to man the [...]50-caliber machine guns <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> launch torpedoes. Akin prepared to toss a barracks bag filled with code books overboard. However, as the light improved, and the vessel drew closer, another look though the binoculars revealed that it was not a Japanese destroyer at all, but PT-41, carrying an angry Bulkeley. Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove.|$|E

500|$|After Penn State's quadruple {{overtime}} {{win against}} Michigan, {{they tried to}} get healthy, with veterans being held out of a scrimmage that occurred during the week of practice, instead working on conditioning. One ESPN writer opined that defensive coordinator John Butler needed to emphasize reworking the secondary, similar to how he had focused on reworking the defensive line, which was successful during the prior week's game. Also, Penn State needed to find additional [...] "playmakers" [...] to supplement Allen Robinson in the receiving game, as well as determine who would lead the running game, as Zach Zwinak had fumbled against Michigan and was taken out, and Bill Belton took over and performed well. Halfway through the season, ESPN.com rated Robinson as the team's offensive MVP, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones as the team's defensive MVP. The midseason report noted that Penn State had a grueling schedule {{in the second half of}} the season that would test the depth of its defense, limited by lack of scholarship players. Lancaster Newspapers concurred with ESPN, awarding their first half offensive and defensive MVPs to Robinson and Jones respectively as well, adding Sam Ficken as special teams MVP. The column also called sophomore defensive end Deion Barnes the biggest disappointment of the first half, noting that he had even been relegated out of the starting lineup. Quarterback Christian Hackenberg, who had started the first six games and had a [...] "halftime" [...] in the bye week, as there were still six games to play, viewed the bye week as a bonus: [...] "We have a couple more days to prepare, get a good game plan <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go to a hostile environment and play a really good football team. I think it's more of a bonus for us." [...] Coach Bill O'Brien concurred, asserting that Penn State's win against Michigan gave Hackenberg confidence and development.|$|E
