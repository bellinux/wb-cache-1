5|$|Evans {{was killed}} by police on 5 January 1976, {{at his home in}} Los Angeles. Officers were called when his girlfriend phoned the police <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that Evans was {{confused}} and had a gun. The police mistook the air rifle Evans was holding for a rifle and shot him dead.|$|E
5|$|The Romualdez clan {{was torn}} apart by the presidential campaign. To fix this, Imelda {{allegedly}} sent out invitations to family members, some of whom supported the opposing party, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> they were all welcome at their house in Ortega.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Travers {{heard the}} gunmen rummaging {{in the back}} of the minibus, where he kept his guitar. Concerned it might be damaged, he {{approached}} the two gunmen <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to be careful. Asked whether he had anything valuable inside the case, Travers replied no. The gunman turned him round, punched him in the back and pushed him on the shoulder back into the line-up.|$|E

6000|$|... "It’s been {{worrying}} me ever since, sir," [...] persisted Tim, who {{was half}} fainting. [...] "I’ve been wondering whether I {{ought to have}} answered <b>them</b> ladies’ questions, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> what I did tell ’em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] {{declared}} Mr. Tooting, [...] "I've {{thought so}} myself. I've got mad, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> so to their faces. But you've said yourself, Mr. Crewe, that we've {{got to deal}} with this thing practically." ...|$|R
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that he did}} not want to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that {{this would not be}} a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Groves retired {{at the end}} of February 1948, and Nichols was {{designated}} as his successor with the rank of major general. At the same time, Forrestal, now the Secretary of Defense, reorganized the Military Liaison Committee. A civilian, Donald F. Carpenter, replaced Brereton as chairman, and there were now two members from each of the three services. On 11 March, Truman summoned Lilienthal, Nichols and Secretary of the Army Kenneth C. Royall to his office, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he expected the AFSWP and the AEC to cooperate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tim’s a fool, sir," [...] said Joe, suddenly, as the overwrought skipper made a {{move towards}} the galley. [...] "’E didn’t seem to know wot ’e was a sayin’ of, so I up <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>’em</b> all about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, isn't this dandy!" [...] she gabbled at him. [...] "Carrie Nork had {{the loveliest}} idea. She {{decided it was}} time for a party, and she 'phoned the Bunch <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> to gather round. [...] . George, this is Carrie." ...|$|R

5|$|Hart Bochner as City Councilman Arthur Reeves; {{a corrupt}} city {{official}} {{who was once}} an intern for Carl Beaumont. He later becomes involved with Valestra's gang {{in order to gain}} the influence to enter City Council, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> where his former boss was hiding in return for campaign funds. Years later, Joker tracks him down and poisons him with his trademark toxin. He last appears in the Gotham City Mental Hospital, having been driven insane by the Joker's chemicals and possibly died as a result. Bochner's father, Lloyd Bochner, voiced of Mayor Hamilton Hill in The Animated Series.|$|E
5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now trying to get their lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herman J. Mankiewicz and {{producer}} Sam Jaffe announced {{they were working}} on a picture, to be titled Mad Dog of Europe, which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler. Jaffe had quit his job at RKO Pictures to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios. Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.|$|E

6000|$|These men {{asked the}} Pilgrims whence they came; <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> They also asked {{them where they}} had lodged, what {{difficulties}} and dangers, what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way; <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> Then said the men that met them, You have but two difficulties more to meet with, and then {{you are in the}} city.[312] ...|$|R

5|$|In his office, Dumbledore {{explains}} that Snape had understood Harry's cryptic warning, and had subsequently contacted Sirius, learning {{that he was}} still at Grimmauld Place. After Harry failed to return from the Forbidden Forest, Snape deduced where he had gone and alerted the Order of the Phoenix, allowing them to save Harry and his friends. It is revealed that during the Christmas holidays, Kreacher had interpreted a command of Sirius's as an order to leave the house, and went to Narcissa Malfoy, the wife of Lucius, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> about Harry and Sirius's close relationship; Voldemort subsequently realised that he could lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries by tricking him into thinking that Sirius was in danger there.|$|E
5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|On May 11, 1769, Boone began {{a two-year}} hunting {{expedition}} in Kentucky. On December 22, 1769, a fellow hunter and he were captured by {{a party of}} Shawnees, who confiscated all of their skins <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to leave and never return. The Shawnees had not signed the Stanwix treaty, and since they regarded Kentucky as their hunting ground, they considered white hunters there to be poachers. Boone, however, continued hunting and exploring Kentucky until his return to North Carolina in 1771, and returned to hunt there again {{in the autumn of}} 1772.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 1921, {{striking}} of the Morgan dollar resumed at the Philadelphia Mint {{under the}} recoinage {{called for by}} the Pittman Act. The same day, Congressman Vestal introduced the Peace dollar authorization bill as a joint resolution. Vestal placed his bill on the Unanimous Consent Calendar, but Congress adjourned for a lengthy recess without taking any action. When Congress returned, Vestal asked for unanimous consent that the bill pass on August 1, 1921. However, one representative, former Republican leader James R. Mann (Illinois) objected, and numismatic historian Roger Burdette suggests that Mann's stature in the House ensured that the bill would not pass. Nevertheless, Vestal met with the ANA <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that he hoped Congress would reconsider when it met again in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} the cast <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> {{that he was}} going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the jawbone. He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E

6000|$|Another fault o' mine {{has been}} being sharp. Most people make mistakes, and they can't bear to see anybody as don't. Over and over agin I have showed people 'ow silly they 'ave been to do certain things, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>'em</b> wot I should ha' done in their place, but I can't {{remember}} one that ever {{gave me a}} [...] "thank you" [...] for it.|$|R
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not have a public address system– <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E
5|$|Darcus Allen, {{a convicted}} murderer who {{previously}} served in an Arkansas prison with Clemmons, was allegedly {{present for the}} conversation. Also on Thanksgiving, Clemmons cut off a GPS monitor which Jail Sucks Bail Bonds had secured onto his ankle. On November 28, Clemmons showed two handguns to friends Eddie and Douglas Davis <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> he planned to shoot police officers with them; the exchange was witnessed by Clemmons' half-brother Rickey Hinton, with whom he shared a house. During the exchange, Clemmons danced around with the guns in his hands, claiming to be Lucifer. He told the men he had twice tried {{to go to a}} Tacoma police station, where he planned to walk in and start shooting. The first time the station was closed, and the second time he got a flat tire on the way there, Clemmons claimed. He talked about stopping at a crowded intersection or a school and shooting people there.|$|E
5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that if they would promise {{to go home and}} not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E
