40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the cumulative and interactive effects on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gluten strength and mixing properties of dough associated with the duplication of the Glu-D 1 locus. A partially isohomoeoallelic line RR 240, in which a segment of the wheat chromosome 1 D containing the Glu-D 1 locus encoding the Dx 2 + Dy 12 subunits and translocated to the long arm of the chromosome 1 A through homoeologous recombination, was assessed. Agronomic traits and yield components were studied in the translocated line RR 240 and compared with the control line cv. Courtot. Both lines were evaluated under field conditions in two experimental years. Technological effects resulting from the duplication of HMW glutenin subunits Dx 2 and Dy 12 were evaluated using the <b>Alveograph</b> <b>test,</b> the Mixograph test and the baking test. The RR 240 line was shown to have a lower agronomic performance for 1000 -kernel weight and grain yield. However the duplication of the Glu-D 1 allele was associated with a significant effect on dough strength and mixing resistance, and on the Zeleny sedimentation volume. Baking parameters were not significantly modified between both lines although the score values of the CNERNA test were observed to be slightly higher in RR 240 than in Courtot...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the relations between quality of the wheat and white flour obtained through industrial milling, several parameters related to functional properties of the proteins and starch were analyzed. The parameters defining the proteins functionality are wet gluten, Gluten index, deformation energy of dough and minimum torque C 2 and allowed establishing significant correlations between wheat and flour. Concerning the starch baking performance, the parameters that allowed establishing significant correlations between wheat and flour are falling number value, amylase activity, starch gelatinization and cooking stability range. Analyzing the trend of variation of the quality parameters given by Mixolab and <b>Alveograph</b> <b>tests</b> for wheat and flour, one {{can see that it}} is possible to predict the flour quality based on wheat quality...|$|R
40|$|A core {{collection}} of 372 accessions representative of worldwide hexaploid bread wheat diversity [Balfourier, F [...] Roussel, V., Strelchenko, P., Exbrayat-Vinson, F., Sourdille. P., Boutet, G., Koenig, J., Ravel, C [...] Mitrofanova, O., Beckert, M., Charmer, G., 2007. A worldwide bread wheat core collection arrayed in a 384 -well plate. Theoretical and Applied Genetics 114, 1265 - 1275] {{was used to}} evaluate the available genetic diversity of agronomic and quality characteristics. The traits assessed during the vegetative period were date of ear-emergence, date of flowering, lodging, disease susceptibility and pre-harvest sprouting. Thousand kernel weight, test weight, grain hardness, grain protein content, pentosan viscosity and grain colour were also measured. The rheological properties of the derived white flours were estimated using mixograph and <b>alveograph</b> <b>tests.</b> For most of the traits, a wide phenotypic variation was observed across all the accessions. Several parameters (mixograph width parameters before and after peak time, alveograph dough tenacity and extensibility, near infrared measurements, like those for protein content, and absorbance measurements of palmitic acid and linoleic acid content) made it easier to discriminate between the cultivars. The largest ranges of variation were found in landraces and old cultivars rather than in more recent varieties. This is evidence that there is sufficient variability available for rare alleles, which have been eliminated in breeding modern varieties to be detected. Such a core collection will therefore be a useful resource for future genetic studies on wheat quality...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the belief}} that the {{rheological}} properties of wheat fl our and dough are related to the flour quality and its processing characteristics, they are of great importance in the baking and milling industries. The Farinograph, Extensograph, Amylograph and <b>Alveograph</b> <b>tests</b> are the most common empirical tests used for assessing rheological properties of wheat dough. Recently, new rheological tool for wheat fl our characterization, called Mixolab, has been developed. The advantage of using Mixolab is that one can measure protein and starch characteristics in a single test. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between Mixolab parameters and parameters obtained using Farinograph and Amylograph among flour samples of different technological quality. Mixolab water absorption value was significantly correlated to Farinograph water absorption value (r = 0. 9816) as well as Mixolab dough formation time value (time for C 1) to dough development time obtained using Farinograph (r = 0. 9668), while the values which indicate dough stability have not expressed so high correlation (r = 0. 7484). In addition, difference between the values of maximum torque (C 1) and torque at the end of the first period of constant temperature (T= 30 Â°C) obtained by Mixolab expressed good correlation with the Farinograph degree of softening (r = 0. 8504). A significant correlation coefficient (r = 0. 8812) was determined between the Amylograph peak viscosity parameter and C 3 value which is an indication of starch gelatinization...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{considered}} a typology of pizza dough obtained in standard conditions (raw materials and technology of production), and a study has been performed {{on the base of}} mechanical parameters obtained by experimental tests performed with an alveograph. It has been possible to obtain the diagrams p - v and to evaluate some characteristic parameters,, max (of break-up),,,,,. They have allowed to individualize the mechanical characteristics of the considered material. Besides, in such way, the acting load and the strain parameter have been detected in every instant considered (load and strain time history). A constitutive stress-strain equation derived from Lade's elastoplastic theory was used to model pizza dough behaviour. <b>Alveograph</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on standard test piece of a optimal pizza dough, at a moisture content of 35 % and an initial bulk density of 917 kg/m 3 to evaluate the material property parameters. The estimated parameters were used in the constitutive equation to calculate stress-strain relationships for pizza dough. Results showed that Lade's theory adequately describes the stress-strain behaviour of pizza dough for the conditions tested. By an opportune computational code it has been individualized a virtual material that gives the same values of the strain obtained by the experimental tests under the action of the load. By a comparison of the diagrams obtained by the experimental tests with those obtained by the numerical simulation it has been possible to individualize the material that numerically simulates the pizza dough considere...|$|R
40|$|Most objectively, {{the dough}} {{rheological}} methods can characterize {{the quality of}} winter wheat. The Farinograph test is the traditionally used one in Hungary, but the importance of other methods, such as <b>Alveograph</b> and Extensograph <b>tests,</b> are getting more widely known due to the interest and requirements of the industry and export markets. The Hungarian Standard on wheat quality follows {{the changes in the}} global markets; this is why the falling number appeared in the MSZ (Hungarian Standard) 6383 in 1998. As the interest in the results of other rheological test increased from our accession to the European Union, the evaluation of these parameters on different varieties has become an important issue of qualification and in 2012 limit values for Alveograph and Extensograph parameters appear in the Hungarian wheat quality standard. Additionally, while the baking value was the only evaluated parameter of the Farinograph test earlier, the standard was supplemented with limit values for water absorption capacity and stability too...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} decade due to the changed climate in the Mediterranean region, {{technological}} quality of Triticum aestivum wheat has varied extremely. The effect of changed climate conditions was demonstrated in a directly (drought, temperature stress, increased rainfall) and indirectly manner (development of pest-field molds and insects). The wheat bug damaged kernels have become a characteristic phenomenon in recent years. The degree of wheat protein damage {{is influenced by the}} intensity of wheat bug attack and plant development stage in which the attack takes place. In certain years, wheat harvested in Serbia had very poor technological quality and used additives have not given the desired results. Therefore, a need to find some other possible solutions arose. Since in Serbia durum flour is readily available in the market, it could be used as improvement agent in bread making. Moreover, its novel use would reduce the price of a durum wheat processing products. Therefore, the chemical composition of soft wheat and durum wheat flour samples was investigated. Rheological properties of all raw materials were determined using Farinograph, Extensograph, Amylograph and <b>Alveograph.</b> The baking <b>tests</b> based on durum and common wheat flours were conducted. Also, the volumes of obtained breads were measured and sensory evaluation was performed. Results of the chemical composition and dough rheological properties of tested flour samples showed that they differ in terms of bread baking properties. Comparison of bread made from wheat flour characterized by damaged protein structure, bread made from wheat flour with damaged protein structure and with 50 % of wheat flour having excellent quality and bread made from wheat flour with damaged protein structure with 50 % of durum flour, revealed that only the addition of durum flour resulted in the bread of appropriate coherent structure and of adequate sensory quality...|$|R
